  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ezekiel experienced this 
    vision near the beginning of the sixth century B.C.E. Even before his book 
    was canonized as part of the Bible, his vision had become the archetype of 
    Jewish mystical ascent. Until the emergence of the Kabbalah, Jewish mystics 
    used Ezekiel's account as their model. <i>Ma'aseh merkavah</i>, the account 
    of the Chariot--as it came to be called--was expounded in some circles, imitated 
    in others. An entire literature developed recounting the visionary exploits 
    of those who followed in Ezekiel's footsteps...The journey was arduous and 
    dangerous, requiring intense, ascetic preparation and precise knowledge of 
    secret passwords in order to be admitted to the various heavenly palaces guarded 
    by menacing angels. THE FINAL GOAL WAS TO ATTAIN A VISION OF THE DIVINE FIGURE 
    ON THE THRONE.&quot; </font>The Essential Kabbalah, by Daniel C. Matt, pp.3,4<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Throughout the first three chapters of the Book of 1 Corinthians 
  Paul is emphatically telling us that it is impossible to fathom the depths or 
  the heights of the Mystery of Christ by resorting to earthly wisdom, or through 
  purely literal interpretations of sacred writ. Nor in matters of the Eucharist--the 
  mysteries of the Mass (the great Passover sacrifice)--can we trust the conclusions 
  of those who were gathered at the Council of Nicea in the fourth century, and 
  who established for the rest of the world its philosophy of Christ, thus claiming 
  for themselves the title of <i>the Church</i>, because those who actually won 
  the dispute had no deep, or higher insight to it themselves. By that time in 
  history the true meanings of the Mystery of Christ had already passed over the 
  heads of &quot;the Church,&quot; and they (the leaders of that church), had 
  already been left to their own earthly ways and their imperfect reasonings. 
  Because of their emerging complicity in the affairs of the lower world, and 
  their continued participation in acts of Human Sacrifice (human warfare) God 
  had rendered these prelates of the New Christian Order fully incapable of understanding 
  the words of Paul which said: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet 
    not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to 
    nought:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the 
    hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory: </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Which none of the princes of this world knew; for had 
    they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Corinthians 2:6-8; Psalm 24:7-10)</font><i><font size="+1">. </font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Paul is obviously not referring to the Presence of God residing 
  in the life of one single individual named Jesus alone (for as we shall see, 
  the Druid, or Central European cult of Hesus, or Jesus, suspended from the limbs 
  of the Cosmic World Tree, is older by far than Christianity itself), but rather 
  to the manifestation of the One God (the Angel of Divine Presence) who dwells 
  in every single individual, throughout every generation. Had any of the leaders 
  of the world understood this they would never have had anything to do with war, 
  or assassinations and executions, or in the least with matters involving injustice 
  or oppression, or in any of the matters that are unfolding upon the earth in 
  our time, because the Lord of Glory is He who is not only born in every human 
  birth, and the same who dies in every single human death, but He is the same 
  who overshadows and permeates the entire Living reality of our own times. Thus 
  He is also the Force in the earth that initiates human warfare, and the same 
  who is presently drawing the leaders of the earth and those who follow them 
  into the Flames of the coming conflagration, to devour them and all their warring 
  ways at last from the earth itself. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Had the leaders of the world understood this they would have 
  not only removed their hands from every matter involving life and death, but 
  they would have refrained throughout all their generations from sitting in such 
  places of earthly authority to begin with, for now they are caught, and the 
  spirit that dwells within them is revealed. What is being judged and condemned 
  in all of them is the human ego grown out of proportion to the mere earth-born 
  form it inhabits. (The Cross, of course, is the solution). And especially those 
  Western leaders that have come in the name of Christ in these times, for these, 
  claiming to be &quot;freeborn,&quot; are slaves instead to their own natural 
  ambitions and earthly passions--and to the industry of war (engaged in war after 
  war after war as they are)--knowing full well as they should, having the ministers 
  of God and the Word of God at their immediate disposal, that God is the<i> God 
  of War. </i> (Exodus 15:3; Revelation 15:1-3). (Please see the chapter entitled 
  The Church and the American Military Establishment). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These leaders reason to themselves that they do not make war 
  for the same reasons as others, but only to stop war. Never mind that they, 
  like spiritual madmen, are also willing in the end to sacrifice a few million 
  of &quot;our&quot; lives in the process. Like their warring brothers in the 
  Islamic world--who also cannot discern the difference between the Light and 
  the Darkness, between the spirits of angels and men, between the Greater Holy 
  War and the Lesser--they are caught. What is the difference, say, between what 
  the Taliban have recently done to the standing images of the Buddha in Afghanistan 
  and what the Christian leaders have been doing all these centuries to the purely 
  spiritual image of Christ in the West?</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And when it is said unto them, Do not make mischief in 
    the land, they say: We are but peace-makers.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Now surely they themselves are the mischief makers, but 
    they do not perceive it...</font></i><font size="+1">(Sura 2.11, 12).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And what is the difference between George Bush, and his American 
  cohorts, and Osama ben Laden and his <i>Al Qaida</i>? Osama ben Laden does not 
  profess to be a <i>free</i> man, a follower of Christ. He falls down Five times 
  a day before Allah. He is a slave of Allah, and does Allah's will. The difference 
  is essential to our understanding of what is happening in the world.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Shall we be accused now of some form of treason? Or of some 
  form of spiritual heresy by the practitioners of the American religion? (The 
  religion of Ba'al). And especially will certain of them ignorantly, and might 
  we add arrogantly, add to these accusations by seizing first upon those verses 
  which say: <i>For many deceivers are entered into the world…</i>(2 John 7). 
  (The followers of Ba'al love to quote from scripture, and believe they understand 
  its meanings). These children of Darkness (those who have always persecuted 
  the righteous in the name of Christ), are the ones who have always deceived 
  others, however, by stirring up the simple minded with inflamatory sermons, 
  political and religious accusations, and through their own ignorance by always 
  challanging the truly enlightened sons and daughters of God with versus from 
  the Bible--by trying to entangle them in their words, by insisting that they 
  also quote Bible verses to justify themselves. In our times, and in our case, 
  with the charge: &quot;Are you saying that you do not believe that Jesus actually 
  lived? Or that he actually came in the flesh? Well our church (you know, the 
  ones with all the flags flying around the sanctuary) believes it, and the leaders 
  of our country believe it.&quot; And then with great self-assurance they will 
  quote the verse: <i>"Hereby know ye the spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth 
  that Jesus is come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confesseth 
  not that Jesus is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of 
  anti-christ, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already 
  is it in the world."</i> (1 John 4:1-3). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So where do they fail? Where do they trip over the meaning 
  of the Scriptures? Where do they fail to recognize the true spirit of antichrist, 
  of which they themselves are in league? Where they fail to observe that the 
  Scripture says <i>IS COME IN THE FLESH, </i>not "has come in the flesh." It 
  is the spirit of antichrist that refuses to believe that Christ is still come 
  in the flesh, at this very moment in time. It has been present in every generation 
  since the time of Christ, and even before that time--in all of those who have 
  been persecuted and killed for righteousness' sake, and it will be fully revealed 
  in the Anointed Ones who will be appear now at the place named Majesty on the 
  Tree of Life. (See Zechariah, chapter 4):</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">To see the whole of it more clearly we must take an excursion 
  backwards in time, to the ideas and revelations that affected the mind of those 
  first-century adepts in the Mystery of Christ--those who gave to the world its 
  earliest versions of the Gospels. And in so doing we will learn something more 
  of why the Body of Christ (the nonviolent image of the Angel of Divine Presence) 
  was presented to the world as a Corpse suspended on the limbs of the Cosmic 
  Tree, instead of, say, in the form of the <i>Pantakrator</i>, or Conquering 
  Lord of lords and King of kings that He is. (Revelation 19:11-19). The Lord 
  presented Himself in both forms to the mind of the early church, as the God 
  of War and the God of Peace--as Warrior and pacifist. To perceive Him in the 
  first form is immediately to become Him in the second form, as it is written: 
  <i>Follow Peace with All men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the 
  Lord. </i>(Hebrews 12:14).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Jesus said, Whoever has come to understand the world has 
    found (only) a corpse, and whoever has found a corpse is superior to the world...</font></i><font size="+1">(Gospel 
    of Thomas 56; 1 Corinthians 1:18-24). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It is the latter, the form of the Sacrificial Lamb, that we 
  must emulate. It has to do with the process of human transformation, with the 
  Abel-like spirit that God has been creating in Their children since the beginning. 
  It has to do with the great Non-violent Sacrifice, or <i>Yajna</i>, of the Vedas, 
  which prefigured the sacrifice of Isaac in the time of Abraham (Brahma), which 
  in turn prefigured the sacrifice of Christ two thousand years later (Galatians 
  3:16; 29), and which still defines and inspires the hearts and minds of the 
  true Remnant in our time. (Please compare 1 Kings 19:18 with Revelation 11:13). 
  The doctrine of non-violence has its origins in the West, in the teachings of 
  Adam, or Manu, in the garden of Eden. These teachings anticipated the end of 
  the Atlantean age, and those events that first began to set those earliest of 
  pacifists (who heard and obeyed the instructions of their fathers, and which 
  were characterized in the collective sense by the spirit of Abel) apart from 
  those who remained warriors, despite the teachings (who were later characterized 
  in the figures of Cain and then Nimrod). These pacifists, the earliest adepts 
  in the religion of Adam (the religion of Manu), were also the earliest adepts 
  in the Vedic religion:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There is a Heavenly Ganges in the same way as there is a Heavenly 
  Nile, because the two of them came down from their common source in the garden 
  of Eden. Thus to meditate on the flow of the Ganges as it descends from above, 
  and as it enters back into the encircling oceans of the world, is to enter into 
  the stream of the great Impersonal Presence of Brahma, the Universal World-Soul. 
  It leads to rebirth again in this world. To meditate on the hidden source of 
  the Ganges, however, is not only to return in mind to the Foot of this great 
  Mystery in the garden of Eden, but it is to ultimately find the center of it 
  as well, and </font><font size="+1"><a href="../UsedImages/pg06.gif">the Doorway</a>

<p><font size="+1">Describing a particular ritual mask used in Vedic times in 
  India, one commentator says: "The cross carried on the cheeks of this mask is 
  a pre-Christian symbol of great importance. It symbolized the start of the first 
  worship of God in heaven, which came at the time of the so-called creation, 
  c.5500 B.C. In the Vedic literature of India the primordial man is hanged upon 
  the Cosmic Cross. He sacrifices himself in order to re-create the universe, 
  as did Odin on the tree Yggdrasil. The cross then symbolizes the axis of the 
  rotating universe joining the upper with the lower portions of the universe, 
  and the left with the right." As we learn to see how these ideas got to India 
  from the West in the first place, we will also see how they found their way 
  back out of the East to the West again, not only in the time of Christ but long 
  before that in the archetypal wanderings of Brahma and Sarasvati, who in the 
  Hebrew scriptures become none other than our own Hebrew parents Abraham and 
  Sarah.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> But first: In Rishi Dayananda Sarasvati's commentary on the

<p><font size="+1">The Vedic story, along with the Hebrew story, begins in Eden, 
  in the myths and legends of the Atlantean age, and has its roots in the realization 
  that both types--those who were like Cain, and those who were like Abel (the 
  spirits of both the children of Darkness and the children of Light)--were already 
  abroad in the earth at that time. They emerged together as a direct result of 
  the Torah, or the Veda, that was handed down by the Spirit (by angels) to Adam, 
  and then by the adepts in this philosophy to the rest of the world. The very 
  First Principle of this revelation was, and still is, the Principle of Unity, 
  or the Oneness of God's Presence in all things and in the sum of all events. 
  Transgression against this First Principle is only possible within the Great 
  Circle of this Adamic revelation. (Every nation, and every individual who wages 
  war in the Name of this God is ultimately in violation of this first precept 
  of the Oracles of God). Outside of the Circle of this revelation (outside of 
  Christ's teachings), there is no transgression. Or, in other words, outside 
  of this Great Circle of historical events there is no other Presence, and no 
  other will in force but God's. So it is those who proclaim the Name of God, 
  and by that we mean the Name of Christ, who are in transgression of God's precepts, 
  and not the other nations of the earth. (See Romans 4:15). </font></p>

  the Waters that overflowed the Atlantean age, of which Plato wrote: "In a single 
  day and night of rain…Atlantis disappeared and was sunk beneath the sea." (The 
  Timaeus, 25). What sort of flood did God bring across the earth in those days? 
  It was not a literal, geological event, but rather a flood of human events. 
  It was a flood of War. It flowed over the mountains and hills, and along the 
  river valleys and across the sea. It encompassed the entire Atlantean civilization, 
  as it is written: <i>And the waters which thou sawest…are peoples, and multitudes, 
  and nations, and tongues.</i> (Revelation 17:15): </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise 
    like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing 
    like the rushing of mighty waters! </i></font></p>

<p><i><font size="+1"></font></i><font size="+1">These wars are the underlying 
  subject of Plato's discourse on Atlantis, how it sank beneath the waves. (Psalms 
  65:7; Isaiah 28:16,17; Isa. 54:9). Did Atlantis literally disappear? No, but 
  the events concerning it disappeared beneath the historical recollections of 
  man, under the many subsequent waves of migrations and civilizations--but not 
  completely. They were preserved in Egypt, from whence Plato learned of them, 
  and in the Vedas, in the oral traditions of many indigenous peoples and in the 
  Torah. </font></p>

    the attraction of a second war. The apparent 'peace'…more and more reminds 
    us of the still mirror-like but already inevitable, alluring smoothness of 
    the River Niagra as it approaches the waterfall, whose still distant but gradually 
    roaring noise becomes portentously audible. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AS WE STRENGTHEN

    he accurately named it 'The End of the World.'…This vision is both Russian 
    and universal, but it is no longer European, because to be a 'European' no 
    longer means being 'universal.' In order to understand that 'the end of the

    must recall the fact that our whole literature from Chadaev, who all his life, 
    in mortal terror, prayed for Russia and Europe together: 'Thy kingdom come,' 
    and Gogol, who became mad and died from the same terror, and Dostoevsky, 'the 
    man of the Apocalypse,' to Solovyov, with his story about 'the end of the 
    world' and Rozanov with his 'Apocalypse of Our Time'--THE WHOLE RUSSIAN LITERATURE, 
    THE SOUL OF RUSSIA, IS ESCHATOLOGY--THE RELIGION OF THE END. Celebrated as 
    it is…this literature remains unknown in this, its chief essence. 'And, lo,

    Universal history, it is necessary to see its source and its end; in order

    of the inner world of personality-psychology; the second knowledge was 'not-I,' 
    the existence of the outer world-cosmology; the third knowledge was 'I.' and 
    'not-I'-eschatology. All these three sciences are equally exact, but not equally 
    easy to grasp. The first is the easiest, the last most difficult. ALL...CIVILIZATION

    AND SHINETH EVEN UNTO THE WEST, SO SHALL THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN BE.' 
    'The judgment of the world and of all that is in the world comes out of Fire.' 
    'When the Fire shall come, it will judge all and take all'--thus again Heraclitus 
    proclaims, as it were, the Fire of the Sun: 'I am come to send Fire on the

    do, the prophet does: he ties the two ends, the past with the future, Atlantis 
    with the Apocalypse. He begins the narrative of the Last Judgment of the first 
    humanity with a prophecy of the second: 'Lo, the Lord cometh with His holy 
    darkness, He will pass judgment.' Plato could not say this 'He cometh'; nor

<p><font size="+1">Literalists accuse others of saying that the Bible is not literally 
  true when these others say that it is composed of allegories and metaphors, 
  and symbols which cannot be interpreted literally. It is the wisdom, or the 
  truth of the allegory, however, that makes the Bible literally true. Noah's 
  ark provides a prime example. Those who insist on the literal inerrancy of the 
  Bible have also sent expeditions to Mount Ararat to find a literal ark. They 
  insist that it is literally there, and that it literally carried all the animal 
  life on earth above the waters of the flood to safety; and that after the waters 
  receded the ark rested, sending all of its inhabitants out to repopulate the 
  world (to say nothing of the rich, and exquisite racial diversity that has occurred 
  to the human species in this short 4,400 years). We also say the story is true. 
  We depart from the literalists, however, when we say that the story did not 
  happen as it was written, but that it is &quot;happening&quot; as it was written. 
  The ark symbolizes the entire vessel of History, upon which all who are destined 
  to survive the judgment wars of this age are riding. All the generations since 
  the time of Adam have been aboard. (The animals and other beasts symbolize, 
  as we shall come to see, the various intellectual and emotional levels, and 
  behavioral patterns and spiritual conditions of the whole human family). It 
  was built of wood cut out of the ancient forest, where the World Tree also grew 
  in the midst. It was, in fact, constructed to carry the World Tree itself, to 
  preserve its meanings; indeed, to carry it across the Sea toward the East so 
  that it could be reconciled to all of its own Higher meanings. To see how it 
  was constructed we will simply divide the first chapter of Genesis into two 
  periods, each illustrated by a time-line "six days" in length:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg175.gif" width="480" height="158"></p>
<p><font size="+1">The first line is a record of the vast time that passed between 
  the creation of the Universe (the Great Emanation), and the time, six cosmic 
  days later, when God appeared to the mind of Adam. (Genesis 1:1 to 1:26). The 
  second line is, also according to the Scriptures, divided into six days of One 
  Thousand years each. It reflects the period that has transpired between God's 
  revelation to Adam and our own time. Together these lines create the dimension 
  of the Ark which is 300 cubits long and 50 cubits wide, or Six times longer 
  than it is wide. Then into this vessel we shall lay the structure of the Tree 
  of Life itself. </font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg176.gif" width="482" height="103"></p>
<p><font size="+1">Why is the ark 50 cubits wide (aside from its own natural proportions 
  to its length)? Because Fifty is the number assigned by Nature to the Day of 
  the Great Jubilee, wherein God has ordained a release from the Dark powers of 
  this age. (Leviticus 25:10-13). Fifty is also the number assigned to the American 
  empire from which the Nation-Church must be delivered.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg42print.gif" width="359" height="252"></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Ark is also 50 cubits wide because it is 300 cubits long, 
  and this because the number 300 is equal in the Hebrew numerical system of things 
  to the words RVCh ALHIM, Ruach Elohim. It is a name (as we shall see in the 
  chapter on the Holy Name) indicative of the Union that exists between the Divine 
  Father and Mother. She, who fills up the dimensions of the Tree of Life, and 
  who is the Spirit of Elohim in the world, has numerical characteristics as well, 
  as do all phenomenal realities--so that we can conceptualize Her Presence in 
  our minds--and this number is: R=200, V=6, Ch=8, A=1, L=30, H=5, I=10, M=40, 
  for a total of 300. (We will also see how this number 300, which in its sum 
  equals the value of the <a href="../UsedImages/pg263.gif">Hebrew letter Shin</a>, 
  plays its part in the construction of the name Jehoshua--(YHWH + Shin) or YHShWH-- 
  which is the combined name of the Father, Mother, and the Son). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And when the ark is viewed sideways it has Three stories. (Gen.6:16). 
  This was the ancients' way of expressing their understanding of the Three-storied 
  nature of the human life-force, composed as we are of Spirit, Soul, and Body. 
  (1 Thess.5:23). There is a window in the upper level. This means that none can 
  "see" until they have attained to the spiritual life. The ark is Thirty cubits 
  high. This number expresses the dimensions of the Mystery of the Angel of Presence 
  (the Great Mandala) on the Tree of Life. From the Navel, the center of the mystery, 
  its limbs extend upwards to the sefirot named Love and Power (or Mercy and Judgment), 
  and downwards to those named Endurance and Majesty...</font></p>

    Gospel of Thomas 19).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> These Five add up to the number 30. This is also why the Scriptures 
  describe the time that this mystery began to dawn upon the earth in the time 
  of John the Baptist by saying: <i>That Jesus himself began to be about Thirty 
  years of age.</i> (Luke 3:23). We also notice that the center of the Mystery 
  of Christ fits into the same place on the Oracle as the Door of the ark. Thus 
  the words: <i>"I am the door."</i> (John 10:9). This is the door, of course, 
  that leads the soul into this world, and then out of it again. The path leads 
  inwards. It also leads upwards, to the summit of Mount Zion, or <a href="../UsedImages/pg492.gif">Horeb</a></font>.</p>

    is noteworthy that, on a Greek vase reproduced by Guigniaut, the Tree round

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As regards the Slavonic peoples, 
    Manhardt and de Gubernatis have recorded more than one legend bearing witness 
    TO THEIR BELIEF IN A COSMOLOGICAL TREE. Such is, among the Russians, the Oak 
    Tree of the island Bujan, on which the Sun retires to rest every evening and 
    from which it rises every morning; WATCHED BY A DRAGON, it is inhabited by 
    the Virgin of the Dawn. (Ps.110:3)… In brief, both Semites and Aryans were 
    acquainted with THE TREE OF HEAVEN, THE TREE OF LIFE, AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE…Do 
    such coincidences suffice to justify the assumption that all these traditions 
    have one and the same origin or even that they represent an old stock of folk-lore 
    bequeathed to the Aryans and Semites by the common ancestors? (pp.166-69)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.Comparative archeology shows clearly 
    how these exchanges are brought about, when it enables us to see how the Mesopotamian 
    type of the Sacred Tree was adopted by the Persians to represent THEIR TREE 
    OF IMMORTALITY, by the Buddhists to typify THEIR TREE OF WISDOM; and by Christians 
    to symbolize THEIR TREE OF TEMPTATION. Each race, each religion, has its independent 
    type, which it preserves and develops in accordance with the spirit of its 
    own traditions, approximating it, however, by the addition of extraneous details 
    and accessories, to the equivalent image adopted in the plastic art of its 
    neighbors. Thus the current that makes the Lotus of Egypt blossom on THE PARADISIAC 
    TREE OF INDIA has its counter-current which causes the Asclpias acida of the 
    Hindu Kush to climb upon THE SACRED TREE OF ASSYRIA. Art and mythology comply, 
    in this respect, with the usual processes of civilization, which is not the 
    fruit of a single Tree, but has always been developed by grafts and cuttings 
    between the (various) branches of the human family. (p.176). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">So with the Oracle built into it--providing those who had access 
  to its dimensions and its meanings with an ability to see not only into the 
  past, thus into the future, but also with the directions to think transcendentally--the 
  mystery of the Ark was taken aboard some ocean-plying vessel and, escaping the 
  ravages of those ancient Atlantean wars, was brought from ancient Eden to Britain

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">From there the ancient adepts passed over to the mainland of 
  Europe in search of the Navel of the Earth--the place named Beauty on the Tree 
  of Life. There was no doubt a pre-existing Mother cultus located there. Ezekiel 
  preserves the encounter between the emerging cult of Adam (the procreative powers 
  of the Male principle) and the older cultus of the Mother in the words: <i>Thy 
  father was an Amorite</i> (a Westerner), <i>and thy mother a Hittite </i> (or 
  of the East). (Ezekiel 16:3). From this region in the center of Europe, which 
  lay between the present-day cities of Vienna and Prague, and thereabouts, did 
  the developing Hebrew (Shemitic) religion go out into the earth. It was these 
  adepts (who were by then, in all their wanderings, becoming a fellowship comprised 
  of every race), who divided the world into three realms, the Heavens (the East) 
  above, the Earth (the West) below, and the Sea (the Middle Region, Europe, where 
  the Great Dragon lives) in between. (Genesis 10:25). (Please see the subchapter 
  entitled The Vedic Connection). The whole complex of ideas will be hidden in 
  time in the figures of Shem, Japheth, and Ham. But because the Hebrew tradition 
  was being closely guarded from the warring sons of Darkness, and because it 
  was in a state of evolution itself, the oral traditions which sprang out of 
  it, and the theology of Nature's three-foldness, found their way into the language 
  systems and emerging doctrines of the various nations, and seemed to grow up 
  with a life of their own ouside of Hebrew thought in the Greek, Hindu, Persian, 
  and Egyptian traditions. As it was, however, they returned out of these places 
  to the Center again in another three-fold set of Hebrew archetypes, Abraham, 
  Isaac, and Jacob. A thorough study of world-history reveals how all of these 
  traditions continued to inform each other, and how they were all brought back 
  together as one in the Mystery of Christ. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Hebrew story tells us that Noah planted a vineyard. (Gen.9:10). 
  This vine was planted in the very center of the World Mystery, as it is written: 
  <i>I am the True Vine.</i> (John 15:1-8). But when Noah forgot himself on that 
  wine &quot;which intoxicates the mind" (as almost the whole world is today…1 
  Thess.5:6,7; Jeremiah 25:27-33), it says that Ham <i>saw the nakedness of his 
  father.</i> This immediately means that Ham is associated with the "lower regions," 
  or those places on the earth that lay "below the Navel." When we understand 
  that the "Navel" is located in the center of Europe we understand that the lower 
  regions of the world lay in the West, and we see that Western Europe (Westward), 
  was exactly the portion of the earth originally allotted to Ham, the father 
  of Canaan: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The will and counsel of God

    world like some enormous smoke (A GREAT CLOUD), preventing those who dwell 
    in it from seeing its founder aright…What then, is fitting for those who are 
    within, excepting with a cry brought forth from the inmost hearts to invoke 
    His aid, who alone is not shut up in the smoke-filled house, that He would 
    approach and open the Door of the house, so that the smoke would be dissipated 
    which is within, and the light of the Sun which shines without may be admitted.&quot;

  <p><font size="+1"><i>God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents 
    of Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant...</i>(Genesis 9:24-27).<i> </i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Shem was given the Middle portion of the earth, which was, 
  in the geo-historical scheme of things, located in Central Europe (a symbol 
  of that place in the universe from whence the entire Mystery of Creation itself 
  emerged), and Japheth was given the Eastern, or upper portions. Japheth in this 
  case represents the Mind, or the Intellect, which contains all the potential 
  for higher thought, and is, in fact, the only means to it. Thus it says <i>he 
  shall dwell in the tents of Shem</i>. Shem represents, in essence, the Soul, 
  where the Intellect and the material form--the Body--are brought together. Shem 
  possessed the knowledge of these things--of the mysteries of the Soul (where 
  all things above are joined to all things below, or shall we say, where all 
  things East are joined to those thing West). Thus those who possess the Center 
  also possess the whole; so we will see in Shem, thus in Japheth's enlargement, 
  the fact that this seed settled everywhere across the breadth of the mystery, 
  from the West to the East, and back to the West again, as it was written: <i>By 
  these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; everyone after 
  his tongue, after their families, in their nations</i>. (Gen.10:2-5). Ham on 
  the other hand represents the flesh, or the Body, which serves them both--just 
  as the entire Western world is facilitating the revelation of the mysteries 
  of the lower world in our time. Neither of the three are literal individuals, 
  however, but Hebrew types created to represent the emerging historical and metaphysical 
  character of the entire human story...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Again, the spirit of Shem symbolizes the life of the Spirit 
  radiating out from the center of reality, just as it does from the heart of 
  every individual who is returning to the Source of all things. Japheth is the 
  intellectual faculties in man, located in the mind, but destined to attain to 
  spiritual maturity. And Ham symbolizes the physical body which supports and 
  serves the two. But also &quot;the ways of the flesh,&quot; and all those who 
  are attached body and soul to the whole lower order of things (see Galatians 
  5:13-26). God cursed Canaan and not Ham because the Body itself is also capable 
  of being brought to perfection when it is brought under subjection and made 
  totally subservient to the higher faculties that have visited it, and which 
  reside within it. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thus the Shemites (and their mysteries) were driven out of 
  Central Europe into the East, and the <i>Canaanites</i> took over their place 
  in the center of things. With the way open to the Eastern regions, those in 
  this warring state of mind also came down in time, and inhabited those regions 
  that we now associate with Canaan, in Palestine, as it is written: <i>And afterward 
  were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.</i> (Gen.10:18). We shall 
  also see--because the mysteries of the West were finding their way to the East 
  (by primarily peaceful means, but also on the forefront and in the wake of tribal 
  conquest); and because the elements of the mysteries were being disseminated 
  in literary types and mirrored images (with Egypt in the East becoming a reflection 
  of those things that will be fulfilled here in this Egypt/America in the West)--how 
  and why the cult of Nimrod (the prototypical strong man--the son of Cush, the 
  son of Ham), was also translated to Egypt. This spirit of Nimrod rose up in 
  those times in the person of the great Pharaoh, the head of the first of <a href="../UsedImages/pg138.gif">Seven 
  great Western empires</a> that would rise up in time to symbolize and comprise 
  the Seven Heads of the Great World Serpent. (see Revelation 12:3; Rev.17:10-12). 
  And because the name of Cush found its way to that land, along with the mysteries 
  of Nimrod, even as far as Ethiopia itself, it is thought that the name originated 
  there, and by others that Ham must somehow be the progenitor of the African 
  race. (It is all bad theology, bad history, and bad science). And likewise, 
  the name of Shem was now associated with the East, and we imagine it to have 
  originated there as well. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was in the context of these same historical events that 
  the followers of <i>Indra </i>(another pre-Mosaic name for YHVH), having escaped 
  the ravages of these wars in the West, appeared in India. They had overcome 
  the Dragon (the serpent in themselves as it were, as well as in the spirit of 
  the sons of Darkness), not yielding to their warring ways. Thus it was in the 
  great struggle that was already being waged between the mind of these children 
  of Light (the Asvins, the Maruts and Rishis) and the mind of the children of 
  Darkness, that the epic Vedic poems were composed. They tell of the judgment 
  wars of God, of which the entire age of Adam is full, and of which the twentieth 
  century is the terrible rising climax. And though these epic poems speak of 
  holy wars against the sons of Darkness, the enlightened soul reading these accounts 
  always <i>rightly divides the Word of God, </i>and<i> </i>realizes that the 
  call to arms is never against the life of other human beings--for that is the 
  way the sons of Darkness read the scriptures...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty 
    through God to the pulling down of strongholds;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">(And for) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing 
    that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Corinthians 10:3-6).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> but against one's own self. The children of Light know that 
  it is in the collective life of all other human beings that God Himself resides, 
  and thus, that the battle must never be waged against other humans but always 
  against the empire of one's own soul. Indeed, it is always against one's own 
  natural inclinations to so-gallantly, as well as to so-ignorantly, participate 
  in the terrible business of human warfare itself. We will see it later in Moses' 
  allegorical commandment to go up and smite <i>the <a href="../UsedImages/pg128.gif">Seven 
  Nations</a> greater and mightier than ourselves.</i> (Deuteronomy 7:1,2). These 
  enemies, Moses will tell the people as he expounds the Oral tradition, are not 
  the peoples of the world themselves, but their fallen ways. It is these that 
  we must overcome--in ourselves, as it is also written:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There in the Vedas are the accounts of these holy wars as they

  newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby</i>.

<p><font size="+1">A study of Vedic lore will immediately reveal to the awakened 
  eye the relationship that existed between the Rishis, those adepts of the Vedas 
  (<i>Of whom Brahma was chief</i>, says Darah Shikoh in his Persian translation 
  of the Upanishads), and those who returned to the center of the Oracle with 
  Abraham in those ancient times. Or rather, those who returned <i>in Abraham</i> 
  as it is written: <i>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their 
  God, and they will be my people. </i>(2 Corinthians 6:16; Leviticus 26:11-13). 
  As Brahma, the Divine Father (from whom Moses derived both the name and the 
  figure of Abraham), was the <i>Chief of the Rishis</i>, travelling with the 
  people, as well as <i>in them</i>, so we will see in the Vedic Maruts the spirit 
  of those Essenes who secretly ascended to the height of the Mystery of the Father 
  (and Mother) again in the time of Christ. (Acts 1:12). Thus in each we will 
  see (not-directly mentioned but not-directly-concealed) the connections that 
  existed between Vedic lore and the story of Abraham (Brahma) and Sara (Sarasvati) 
  as it is told in the Torah, and as it is told again in the Gospels, as it is 
  written: <i>And if ye be Christ's, then ye are Abraham's </i>(Brahma's)<i> seed, 
  and heirs according to the promise.</i> (Galatians 3:29). </font></p>

  Indra in the form of the Sun is born with his rays of burning nature, along 
  with the dawns;' or taking the Sun as dead after sunset, he is addressed as 
  being 'born in the morning, giving light where there was no light.'… Wilson 
  translates it as: 'Mortal! You owe your (daily) birth to such an Indra who with 
  rays of the morning gives sense to the senseless, and to the formless form!'&quot; 
  "Griffith's translation," he says, "is even worse: 'Thou makest light where 
  no light was, and form, O men, where no form was, wast born together with the 
  Dawn.'&quot; In the footnote, however, he says: "…If Maryah (men) be taken to 
  mean the Marutes (the sons of Thunder), the words 'wast born,' although in the 
  singular number, may apply to these…regarded as one host or company and born 
  at One Birth." "Such are the strange imaginations," he says of some of these

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is in apocalyptic literature 
    that we find the first appearance of ideas of a specifically mystical character, 
    reserved for the elect. Scholars do not agree on whether the origins of this 
    literature are to be found among the Pharisees and their disciples or among 
    the Essenes, and it is quite possible that apocalyptic tendencies appeared 
    in both. It is known from Josephus that the Essenes possessed a literature 
    which was both magical and angelogical in content. His silence concerning 
    their apocalyptic ideas can be understood as his desire to conceal this aspect 
    of contemporary Judaism from his (uninitiated readers). The discovery of the 
    literary remains of the Qumran sect show that such ideas found a haven among 
    them. They possessed the original Book of Enoch, both in Hebrew and Aramaic…In 
    fact, traditions resembling those embedded in the Book of Enoch found their 
    way into rabbinic Judaism at the time of the Tannaim and Amoraim, and it is 
    impossible to determine precisely the breeding ground of this type of tradition 
    until the problems presented by the discovery of the Qumran writings have 
    been solved.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Book of Enoch was followed 
    by apocalyptic writing up to the time of the Tannaim, and in different ways, 
    even later. Esoteric knowledge of these books touched not only upon the revelation 
    of the end of time and its awesome terrors, but also upon the structure of 
    the hidden world and its inhabitants: heaven, the Garden of Eden, and Gehinnom, 
    angels and evil spirits, and the fate of the souls in this hidden world. Above 
    this are revelations concerning the Throne of Glory (the Chariot) and its 
    Occupant (Ezekiel 1:5), which should apparently be identified with 'the wonderful 
    secrets' of God mentioned by the Dead Sea Scrolls.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here a link can be established 
    between this literature and the much later traditions concerning (the Mysteries 
    of Creation, and the Mysteries of the Divine Chariot of God). It is not just 
    the content of these ideas which is considered esoteric; their authors too 
    hid their own individuality and their names, concealing themselves behind 
    biblical characters like Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Baruch, Daniel, Ezra, 
    and others. </font>(And may we point out that they also hid their own identities 
    behind one main archetypal personality named Jehoshua, or Jesus)<b>.</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    This self-concealment, which was completely successful, has made it extremely 
    difficult to determine the historical and social milieu of the authors. This 
    pseudepigraphical pattern continued within the mystical tradition in the centuries 
    that followed. The clear tendency toward asceticism as a way of preparing 
    for the reception of the mystical tradition, which is already attested to 
    in the last chapter of the Book of Enoch, becomes a fundamental principle 
    for the apocalyptics, the Essenes, and the circle of Merkabah (Divine Chariot) 
    mystics who succeeded them.&quot; </font>Kabbalah, by Gershom Scholem, p.10<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As readers learn to immerse themselves in these ancient studies 
  they will see how these mysteries were carried out of the Vedic state of mind 
  into the earliest <i>Jewish</i>, and then later Christian state of mind (giving 
  rise in the various scriptures to tales of heroic deeds and epic feats of combat--none 
  of which were to be taken in the purely literal sense by the Mind of light, 
  but indeed in such a way as to stir the initiate to acts of great spiritual 
  courage), and then from the pen of these epic poets to the ends of the earth 
  and to the fulness of these times. It is discovered in the shape of Divine Reality 
  itself, as well as in the corresponding structure of every people's legends 
  and myths. Just as the Cross (the central structure of the Tree of Life), and 
  the Gospel stories that were woven around it, came to define the meaning of 
  spiritual reality to Christians (even if the meanings escaped the mind of Christianity 
  itself), so did the various dimensions of the World Tree come to define reality 
  for the other <i>seemingly</i> different religions of the world. When the picture 
  is seen as a whole, however, we see that it is all One and the same. And immersed 
  in these studies we see how Abraham and Sarah came to symbolize in their migration, 
  humanity's eternal return to God--in all of their children everywhere throughout 
  the earth. This return is accomplished, not in the abrogation of other peoples' 
  beliefs but in the realization of them; for every peoples' beliefs are being 
  fulfilled here in the West in our time, in the unfolding realities of the Mystery 
  of Christ.</font></p>

  Moses, and then again in the time of John the Baptist (the Essene) and Paul

  of one single individual person named Jesus of Nazareth. We would have everyone 
  see instead how the Word appeared in a Single Body of Revelation, and in the 
  collective form of all those who entered into the mystery of these things, as 
  it is written: <i>He who sanctifies, and they who are sanctified are of one.</i>

<p><font size="+1">The Universal Four Handed form of the Lord is reflected, not 
  only in the image of Vishnu imposed over the upper, or supernal dimensions of 
  the World Tree, as well as in the Talmudic image of the angel Sandalphon, but 
  in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, where he exclaims: <i>Holy, holy, holy, 
  is the Lord of hosts: THE WHOLE EARTH is full of his glory.</i> (Isaiah 6:1-3). 
  Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva (and their Feminine counterparts, Sarasvati, Lakshmi and 
  Shakti, or Kali), have also given life and form to the figures of Abraham, Isaac, 
  and Jacob, and their Female counterparts. And while the Hebrew figures take 
  with them from the Vedic archetypes a more historical or human character, they 
  are still, nevertheless, the personification of ideas (gods in the classical 
  sense), and not individual persons themselves...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After discovering the relationship between the Second figure 
  in the Trinity (Vishnu) and Isaac, who becomes a figure of the universal Christ 
  in his non-violent Two Handed form (Genesis 22:1-18; Galatians 3:16-29), it 
  is just a leap of imagination to realize that Jacob, the Third figure in this 
  Hebrew Trinity, represents the whole of humanity--the very domain of Shiva and 
  Shakti-Kali themselves. For it is in the collective form of the primal human 
  spirit that these two destroy the works of men. (Revelation 9). Shiva and Kali 
  destroy the works of men in the very interest of Creation itself. If they were 
  the only manifestations of the Godhead, however, or the only state of mind governing 
  humanity, the earth would already be totally destroyed, and that without remedy. 
  Thus in the higher interest of the creation process Vishnu and Lakshmi sustain 
  the universe of spiritual Thought and Form. And in the totality of all worlds 
  does Brahma and Sarasvati make themselves known. The Three are one and the same, 
  and become so in the mind of every individual soul capable of comprehending 
  it. Humanity is the three-fold structured Temple of God's Holy Presence, and 
  only humanity can reflect all that God has chosen to become. Man's own mind 
  and body is created in the image of the Oracle which proceeds from the Mind 
  of God. Outside of man God is Nature (Vishnu, the Word). Outside of Nature God 
  is Pure Invisible Thought (Brahma).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Allowing the oracles to have their way with our thoughts, we 
  see that when Jacob is sent away from his parents' house in the 28th chapter 
  of Genesis, that his journey would take him (as it has taken the collective 
  mind of Humankind), into the Four corners of the earth before it would carry 
  him back to the center again. He will acquire Four (Syrian) wives in the process--all 
  of whom symbolize, not merely the four pathways to "acquired learning" but the 
  eventual attainment of the Higher Wisdom itself--Herself...(personified in this 
  case by Rachel). For "Syria," in contrast to the higher concept of "Israel," 
  symbolizes the lower, mundane order of things, through which the soul must journey, 
  and in which it must labour, if it is to attain to the Promised State of Mind… 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God, 
    A Syrian ready to perish was my father </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(my 
    old nature)</font><i></i><font size="+1"><i>, and he went down into Egypt 
    </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the lower world)<i></i></font><font size="+1"><i>, 
    and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, 
    and populous...</i> (Deuteronomy 26:5)<i>. </i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Just as Sarah appears in the Scripture <i>with</i> Abraham, 
  because She is One with Him; and just as Rebekah came to Isaac, symbolizing 
  that form of Wisdom that comes to the spiritual aspirant unsought for (the aspirant 
  not even knowing that he or she is being prepared by God for such a union, or 
  for the sacrifice they will be called upon to make), so the greater mind of 
  humanity (Jacob) is occupied in an epic and constant quest for this same connection 
  to spiritual reality. But Jacob, though desiring Rachel (who symbolizes the 
  higher mysteries), had to first settle for Leah, who symbolizes the lesser, 
  or outer mysteries. The general mind of humanity must be first prepared in the 
  lesser before it can attain to the higher. Along with their handmaidens, Bilhah 
  and Zilpah, the two (the four) represent the sum of earthly Wisdom, as well 
  as the Four directions into which the seed of Abraham has gone in search of 
  this Wisdom, and out of which it will come to the Center again. (Luke 13:28,29). 
  It was not until Jacob wrestled with his own angel, and until he began this 
  homeward journey, that his name is changed to Israel (Genesis 32:24-28), symbolizing 
  that he had, at last, overcome the world and had learned the lessons that Wisdom 
  Herself had layed out for him. And we, on our own return to the Center, will 
  learn in the next chapter how the name I(SRA)El is itself derived from the name 
  of this Divine Mother, SaRAsvati, for Moses and the ancient sages of Israel 
  (the Rishis), were learned in all these things.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">So we, in the light of these things, continue to visualize 
  the construction put upon the Gospels by that later fellowship of Essenes who 
  wrote them, and who saw in their times a reflection of our own, and who did, 
  indeed, enter into the wilderness of the nations, and who did indeed return 
  to the land--the state of mind--that was promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
  Which is why one of the chief questions asked about the Essenes is, "What happened 
  to them? Where did they go?" Those who were studied in the secret teachings 
  returned to the center of Europe (open the Book of Acts), and from there, with 
  their books and their mysteries intact, they went off in Twelve directions according 
  to the further dictates of the oracles...James1:1. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">They (many having given their lives), and those who came after 
  them, found their way into the many various Druid, Gnostic, and mystical Judaic 
  sects, until almost all trace of them was gone. But not entirely. Their doctrines 
  will show up in those of the Mahayana school of Buddhism, throughout the Jewish 
  Kabbalah, in the myths and legends of both Northern Europe and Africa, and, 
  as it will become very evident, as far-astride as North and Central America. 
  (Please read <i>The Flayed God, The Mythology of Mesoamerica</i>, by Roberta 
  and Peter Markman; <i>Lost Cities of North &amp; Central America</i>, by David 
  Hatcher Childress; <i>The Shaman's Secret, The Lost Resurrection Teachings of 
  the Ancient Maya</i>, by Douglas Gillette; <i>He Walked the Americas</i>, by 
  L. Taylor Hansen; <i>The Sacred Tree</i>, by Judie and Michael Bopp, and the 
  Four Worlds Development Project; and <i>The Ghost Dance</i>, by James Mooney).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">By following the structure of the ideas and the symbols, and 
  the myths and legends associated with them, we are able to see, not only where 
  the adepts in these mysteries were in touch with each other throughout the whole 
  earth (Psalm 19:1-6), but also how the Spirit was sealing up these things from 
  the mind of the sons of Darkness at the same time. Which is why Paul--who, after 
  being accepted into this fellowship some forty years or more before the Gospels 
  were written, after instructing these Essenes in matters that they themselves 
  were not fully aware of yet of (in matters that appear in the Gospel narratives 
  themselves..such as the <i>Mystery of Christ and him Crucified</i>)--was also 
  deeply secretive about them, even as he went on to inscribe the hidden sense 
  of them onto the consciousness of the Gentile world. And though he was rejected 
  and excommunicated by the rabbis of his time, his incursion into the Gentile 
  world was accomplished according to the dictates of the Law and the Prophets. 
  (See Romans 15:8-12)…</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> And though there were many initial points of contention between 
  the Pharisee, Paul, and the Essenes, there was in the end an agreement on the 
  meaning of it all. (2 Peter 3:15-18). And especially was it clear to all of 
  them, as well as to all those who would be guided by the Holy Spirit in future 
  times (our times), that the battles they were engaged in were purely spiritual 
  and, as far as the Scriptures were concerned, purely allegorical. All who taught 
  otherwise were either of the Darkness, or subject to it: </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A study of the fourth chapter of Revelations reveals it to 
  be a paraphrase of the First chapter of Ezekiel, the Sixth chapter of Isaiah, 
  and the Fourth chapter of Zechariah--projecting, as it does, the import of all 
  of these chapters into the future (into our own time to be exact). The whole 
  of it also reveals the Book of Revelation (the Apocalypse), and the Four primary 
  Gospels, to be purely Kabbalistic documents. And, in accordance with the world-view 
  of those who wrote them, we may open them up right here in America, at the Root 
  of the Tree of Life, in our own time. The vision of Ezekiel (the Chariot of 
  the Dawn), was recorded in Babylon (in the East), and it must, therefore, be 
  opened in Babylon (in the West). Such is the law of Symmetry. It begs to be 
  discovered at the deepest levels of quantum physics, but also in the most mysterious 
  dimensions of human history. All things on one side of the Oracle are a historical 
  and spiritual reflection of the other side. (And even if one can see only one 
  side, the other side is always implied, waiting to be discovered). Thus all 
  things East are a reflection of things West. (Just as things South are a reflection 
  of things North). The Book of Revelation itself must be opened along side of, 
  and in conjunction with all the other prophetic and apocalyptic books, because 
  it is a collective paraphrase of them all--all of which were sealed up together 
  till the last days. (Daniel 12:4; Revelation 20:12-15). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">By studying the oracles see how we in our time are situated 
  at the Seventh emanation on the Tree of Life named Endurance (Matthew 24:13). 
  (Some have named it Victory…1 Cor.15:54-58). And then see how John the Baptist 
  appeared at the Fourth emanation named Love. (John 13:34,35; 15:13-17; 1 John 
  4:17-21). (Some have named it Mercy). See how the great Solar Chariot of Divine 
  Revelation ascended at that time (2 Kings 2:1-11; Matthew 11:12-15), and how 
  it is descending again in our time. See how its descent is being accompanied 
  by all the age-ending and apocalyptic events of our time, but also how these 
  events began to emanate into our collective consciousness in the 20th century 
  from the center of Europe. Realize that as the the Mystery of Christ reveals 
  itself in all the dimensions of heaven and earth, so the divinity of Nature 
  is revealed in the Mystery of Christ. Chief among the elements of Nature is 
  the Sun, the bringer of Light, the source of all Life. Those who have followed 
  the course of this Higher Sun are the same as those who are coming to perfection 
  in these last days. They have become One with the very mysteries of Nature itself:</font></p>
