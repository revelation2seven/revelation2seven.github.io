  <p><b>&quot;A black American writer, J. Saunders Redding, describes the arrival 
    of a ship in North America in the year 1619:</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><font size="3">Sails furled, flag drooping at her rounded stern, she 
      rode the tide in from the sea. She was a strange ship, indeed, by all accounts, 
      a frightening ship, a ship of mystery. Whether she was trader, privateer, 
      or man-of-war no one knows. Through her bulwarks black-mouthed cannon yawned. 
      The flag she flew was Dutch...Her port of call, an English settlement, Jamestown, 
      in the colony of Virginia. She came, she traded, and shortly afterwards 
      was gone. Probably no ship in modern history has carried a more portentous 
      freight. Her cargo? Twenty slaves.</font></b></p>

  <p><b>There is not a country in world history in which racism has been more 
    important, for so long a time, as the United States. And the problem of the 
    'color line,' as W.E.B. Du Bois put it, is still with us. So it is more than 
    a purely historical question to ask: How does it start?--and an even more 
    urgent question: How might it end? Or, to put it differently: Is it possible 
    for whites and blacks to live together without hatred?...&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A

<p><font size="+1">The question aside for the moment, it is clear that there could 
  not be an awakening, or redemption in our time, not here in this country, and 
  therefore not anywhere else in the world, if it were not for the Black experience 
  in America. It was, and is, an essential historical ingredient to the evolution 
  of the human spirit and the unfolding realities of our time. It was essential 
  to blacks, who otherwise would not be part of the momentous events that are 
  taking place, and which are about to take place in America; and it was essential 
  to whites who would otherwise still be slaves to their own darkened nature and 
  to the great delusions of racial and cultural superiority which they brought 
  with them to this continent. We shall not, however, even try to retell the story 
  here, it has been four hundred years in the telling. It is there in front of 
  us (in black and white if you will...and in all the spaces in between), and 
  others have told it in ways far better, they have lived it, and are still living 
  it and still telling it. The books are open for all to see, the words, the pictures, 
  the faces, the names and the events surrounding them, are engraved in vivid 
  detail upon the national psyche; and those wholly spiritual feelings and emotions 
  that attend the mind are riven even deeper in the national soul. (It is, indeed, 
  a marvelous and terrible thing that God has done with all of us, marvelous toward 
  them that have lived the story, endured and overcome, but terrible to those 
  who have failed to understand the meaning of it all, and especially to those 
  who have allowed themselves to be brought to places of authority here in America 
  at this time in history...<i>Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, 
  that all of us together had considered our latter end...</i>Deuteronomy 32:29; 
  Ecclesiastes 8:6-9; <i> </i>Ephesians 6:10-19; 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2).

<p><font size="+1">The African-American story is an heroic story in that it is 
  written from the ground up, and always in the face of physical and spiritual 
  adversity and unending episodes of oppressive social injustice. Of course there 
  are many other people who play an heroic role in the story as well--for it is 
  ever so true: that from the rural south to the cities of the north, a secret 
  language was in the making, one that the master <i>still</i> can not understand. 
  He hears it spoken, and even tries to speak it himself, but he doesn't understand 
  it. It's the language of the people. It resonates beyond the spoken word itself. 
  It speaks in Seven notes--a multitude of chords and many lyrics--but then it 
  reaches an Eighth note (a higher octave), which is synchronized with the heart. 
  It speaks to the heart first, and only after that to the mind--but only to the 
  mind that can hear and understand. It speaks only to those who can rightly interpret 
  the lower octaves of sorrow and despair as well. This language emanates from 
  the soul, from the entire range of human spiritual and emotional experience. 
  It is the language of faith, of expectation, the song of liberation. (Exodus 
  15; Revelation 15:1-4). It speaks to the soul of the people. It vibrates with 
  the Soul of the Universe...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the heart and mind are aligned they will hear the words 
  and understand the song. They were translated from soul to soul, beginning with 
  the simple heartbeat of human existence, and then through the later beat of 
  human oppression (as the Nimrods of the earth came to power, and the resulting 
  spiritual struggles of human existence began to unfold). It is an epic story 
  that has carried all of us back to Eden--back to Atlantis--to America. (One 
  must truly understand what that is all about in order to understand and master 
  the language itself). The hidden intonations were translated in the lilting 
  rhythms of the field and (the real, heartfelt meanings of) gospel song, and 
  then beyond the church house in the slow <i> birth of the blues</i> and even--up 
  until the 1950s and 60s, before the music took on other forms--in the truly 
  communal and secret vernacular of American jazz. It took every string, and both 
  the black keys and the white keys to relay it, and both to understand it. Martin 
  Luther King spoke to this reality from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 
  1963...(But then something went dreadfully wrong, especially with the Civil 
  Rights Movement in this country. The rhythm was lost (the Shepherd was struck 
  down before he could see the way the flock had to go), and the present generation 
  is subliminally expressing its frustration with the failure of it all, and with 
  our failure to see it. It is being expressed in the violent rap lyrics and the 
  screaming and crashing hard core rhythms of the 90s and 00s--complete with fire 
  and mayhem and a hedonistic orgy...<i>at a Woodstock festival</i>? Something 
  did not come across. Well, actually it did. What came across was the intuitive 
  sense that the Civil Rights Movement went in the wrong direction--into the system 
  instead of out of it as the Word commanded us...2 Corinthians 6:14-18; Revelation, 
  chapter 18. Those who made it into the American political, economic and, needless 
  to say, military order have unwittingly become part of the powerful evil design 
  that the American empire has upon its own people and the rest of the world...</font></p>
<p align="center">ROSA VS. OUTKAST</p>
<p align="center">by Leonard Pitts Jr.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Its not that the legal issues are compelling. Indeed, for us journalist types, 
    there are few things sexier than a First Amendment lawsuit. But where the 
    case of Rosa Parks v. OutKast is concerned, what scrapes at your heart is 
    something beyond the law. For all that the suit may say about freedom of speech, 
    it says more about the disconnect between African-American generations, the 
    wrenching sense that an inheritance of pride and purpose was somehow never 
    passed down.</p>
  <p>For those who missed it: The Supreme Court decided this week to allow Parks 
    to go forward with a suit seeking unspecified damages from OutKast, a rap 
    duo that named a song after her. Said song is not about Parks. Nor is it about 
    the Montgomery bus boycott, which she famously triggered by refusing to give 
    up her bus seat in 1955.</p>
  <p>The closest the song comes to referencing history is: &quot;Ah ha, hush that 
    fuss/Everybody move to the back of the bus.&quot; Parks lawyers say she feels 
    exploited. They claim the song sowed confusion, cutting into sales for &quot;A 
    Tribute to Rosa Parks,&quot; a gospel album released in 1995.</p>
  <p>Both arguments are weak. It stretches credibility to suggest even the most 
    naive consumer could mistakenly buy an OutKast CD while looking for gospel. 
    OutKast is Andre 3000 (Andre Benjamin) and Big Boi (Antwan Patton), two young 
    men from Atlanta who, though capable of literate social commentary, are not 
    above musical thuggery and the kind of potty-mouthed declamations so popular 
    in hip-hop. This includes, but is not limited to, the deadly N-word. Benjamin 
    and Patton have said, with touching cluelessness, that naming the song after 
    Parks was their way of honoring her.</p>
  <p>Problem is, and I don't mean to be harsh, they wouldn't know how to honor 
    Rosa Parks if you wrote out instructions. The rappers and the 90-year old 
    are as unalike as citizens of different planets. The difference is not just 
    generational, not just about the gap between swing and rap. Rather its about 
    a fundamental disparity in perception. Rosa Parks is from a time when the 
    average black man or woman felt duty bound to live a life that reflected well 
    on black people as a whole. If there is a single word for what African-Americans 
    of that era prized, projected and sometimes died to defend, that word is dignity.</p>
  <p>It sometimes feels as if each new crop of black Americans is, in some sense, 
    starting all over again, going out with no tether to the sacrifices that made 
    their lives possible, no recognition of their debt to past and future, no 
    inclination to draw on an inheritance of purpose and of pride. Which is why 
    many of their elders are vexed by them, turn away from them, give up on reaching 
    them. BUT JUST WHOSE FAILURES DOES THAT REPRESENT?</p>
  <p>OutKast is the product of an uncensored age, an age when people cross the 
    line so routinely it has all but been erased. Parks became an icon because, 
    faced with a moral challenge, she made a decision. I wish she had found a 
    way, some method beyond the courts, of helping these young men to understand 
    what that means. Understand that the process never ends. And that they have 
    decisions to make, too.</p>

<p align="center">GOODBY, BABYLON</p>
<p align="center">By David Fricke</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;This fantastic box of holy ruckus is the greatest anthology of antique 
    Southern sacred song and oratory ever assembled. Packaged like a pioneer-family 
    heirloom--in a cedar case with a nineteenth-century etching of the Tower of 
    Babel on the lid--<i>Goodby Babylon </i>is six CDs of blues hymns, hillbilly 
    hosannas, choral thunder and hellfire sermons from the 78/rpm era. Some of 
    the most important figures in American music testify here, including the Carter 
    Family, the Louvin Brothers, Blind Willie McTell and a pioneering gospel composer 
    Thomas A. Dorsey. In a 1949 radio broadcast, Hank Williams sings a prophetic 
    spiritual , &quot;I'll Have a New Body,&quot; three years before his own earthly 
    chassis gave out. The Stanley Brothers transform an African-American spiritual, 
    &quot;Standing in the Need of Prayer,&quot; into bluegrass church: silvery 
    picking and sweet-mountain-air harmonies, with a revival-meeting jump in tempo 
    at the end.</p>
  <p>But much of this suffering and faith is the poetic invention of lesser-known 
    men and women, white and black, who intimately knew heavy labor and poverty. 
    On Disc One, bluesman Blind Lemon Jefferson and J. E. Mainer's Mountaineers, 
    a white string band from North Carolina, both sing of life after death with 
    the heated urgency of men for whom life on earth held few rewards. In 1930s 
    &quot;Memphis Flu,&quot; Elder Curry and his Mississippi congregation turn 
    local news--into a galloping lesson on the democracy of God's wrath. The spoken 
    intro to &quot;Down on the Old Camp Ground&quot;--[a] coon shout by the Dinwiddle 
    Colored Quintet--shows, however, that in 1902 there was equality under God 
    but none in the record business.</p>
  <p><i>Goodby Babylon</i> also disapproves the old rock &amp; roll maxim that 
    the devil has the best tunes: God owned many of them first. In &quot;Down 
    on Me,&quot; Eddie Head and His Family provide a sanctified 1930 blueprint 
    for Janis Joplin's 1967 version; the female street singers Two Gospel Keys 
    fire up the godliness in &quot;You've Got to Move,&quot; later covered with 
    more devilish flair by the Rollin Stones. And the Rev. J. M. Gates puts a 
    grim spin on Christmas in his 1926 sermon &quot;Death May Be Your Santa Claus,&quot; 
    which became the title of a Mott the Hoople song. GOD TRULY WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS 
    WAYS.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rolling Stone Magazine,

<p><font size="+1">There's a <i>New Song </i>being written, by thousands now, 
  we just haven't seen the concert, or heard all of its verses yet. It is still 
  coming together. It has to include the Red keys and the Yellow keys you know)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Harold Bloom, in his <i>The American Religion, </i>in a chapter 
  entitled &quot;African American Religion as Paradigm,&quot; touches on an aspect 
  of American spiritual consciousness that has been explored, but not <i>fully</i>, 
  not in the ways we shall discuss in the second part of this chapter: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I find this confirms again my own intuition that the American Religion is 
    born about 1800, and that African American religion was a crucial element 
    in this origin. The ecstasies of the first southern camp meetings tapped a 
    mysterious current of sensation and perception that emanated from the slaves. 
    Mechal Sobel, in &quot;Trabelin' On: The Slave Journey to an Afro-Baptist 
    Faith&quot; (1979), convincingly intimated that what became the religion of 
    Southern Baptists relied unknowingly upon African spiritual formulations...There 
    is an African-American paradigm that informs the emotional immediacy of unmediated 
    Baptist encounters with Jesus...There is a development from collective to 
    highly individual spiritual experience among the African-American Baptists. 
    SINCE THEIR VISION OF A SACRED COSMOS HAD BEEN DESTROYED, IT WAS REPLACED 
    BY A RELATIONSHIP TO AN INTERNALIZED JESUS...</p>
  <p>The African Sacred Cosmos has been studied very extensively, but the fundamentals 
    of its view of the spirit still are best set forth...by Geoffrey Perrinder 
    in &quot;West African Religion&quot; (1961) and by Marcel Griaule in &quot;Conversations 
    With Ogotemmeli: An Introduction to Dogon religious Ideas&quot; (1965). Mechel 
    Sobel, citing them as her authorities, uncovered in the African-American Baptist 
    faith clear survivals of the West African vision of the spirit. Strangely 
    parallel to aspects of ancient Gnosticism, in my own judgment, these survivals 
    may well be the tap-root of concepts of the spirit in American Religion...</p>
  <p>This center of black Baptist spiritual experience became the unknowing paradigm 
    for white Baptist conversionary life. The Dogon &quot;true me&quot; or &quot;real 
    me,&quot; what ancient Gnostics called the &quot;spark&quot; or &quot;pneuma,&quot; 
    became indistinguishable from the Spirit in which St. Paul had been caught 
    up and transported to the heavenly regions. What continued to mark the difference 
    between black and white Baptist experience was the more radical dualism of 
    the African-American sacred cosmos. Doubtless, much of the provocation for 
    this difference ensued from bondage, but survivals of Dogon twinning or doubling 
    had to exist in order to account for the wide prevalence of African-American 
    reliance upon the reality of the &quot;man&quot; within, which was transformed 
    into the saving presence of an interior Jesus. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(pp239-241).</font></p>

  it was right there at the very heart of it. In fact, Black Americans got to

  Civil War, and who fought the first battles over the issues of slavery in America):</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the years after Reconstruction 
    in the South, ex-slaves soon learned that though they were now ostensibly 
    free, many white Southerners were doing everything in their power to keep 
    blacks powerless, immobilized and landless. Blacks began to look to Kansas, 
    the home of John Brown before the Civil War and a center of abolitionist sentiment, 
    as a modern Canaan, a God-appointed home for the African race. Beginning in 
    the 1860s, thousands of blacks began to migrate to Kansas where they believed 
    they would achieve prosperity, and become truly free at last. The town of 
    Nicodemus in Graham County, Kansas, for instance, was founded by black Kentuckians 
    in the 1870s.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The largest wave of black migration 
    to Kansas began in 1879 and continued into the 1880s. This group largely from 
    the states of Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas, called themselves 
    &quot;EXODUSTERS,&quot; COMPARING THEMSELVES TO THE ANCIENT ISRAELITES OF 
    THE OLD TESTAMENT. Though they encountered difficulties not only in getting 
    to Kansas, but also in settling in a place that proved to be no land of milk 
    and honey, most blacks believed it to be infinitely preferable to living in 
    the South.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, not all Southern blacks 
    chose to go to Kansas. Some refused to go out of fear of the unknown. As one 
    ex-slave wrote: &quot;I have a littel place and i Dont want to Brake up to 
    Do better and Do worse.&quot; Some were simply reluctant to forsake their 
    old homes, as was the freedman who said, &quot;We feel sorry to think that 
    we have to leave our fathers', mothers', wives', and children's dust and flee 
    into other states to make a living.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This unusual song conveys the view 
    of an ex-slave who chooses to stay in the South even as his neighbors vacate 
    their homes to go to the Kansas &quot;Promised Land.&quot; Dave and Cathy 
    learned it from the fine singer Sara Grey, who learned it from the field recording 
    of traditional balladeer Everett Pitt from New Jersey. Originally called &quot;De 
    Little Cabins All Am Empty Now,&quot; the song was written as a dialect piece 
    by Thomas P. Westerndorfer in 1881...How a song written in a lively major 
    key came to have this sorrowful Irish-sounding tune is a mystery, but we prefer 
    this setting. It conveys the feeling of fear and loneliness experienced by 
    the narrator, and provides an appropriate moody conclusion to our song collection, 
    and to what was a devastating, terrible Civil War and Reconstruction on the 
    Western Border. </font>(www.bartonpara.com/civilwar/rebel/kansas.htm; www.kshs.org/library/bibafam.htm)</p>

  in Brooklyn. The other to a Christian man named Arthur Hawkins who was also 
  witnessing to his humanity and his faith while he sold religious articles in 
  the lobby of the university at Huntington, West Virginia:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Dear Kadijah,</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">How can I thank you for the fellowship, and for all the spiritual 
  support you gave me those several days at Fulton Mall? I hope to finish my work 
  there on a fruitful day that God shall choose. There are, as you well know, 
  many things that presently divide God's children from each other and many obstacles 
  in the way of true love. Illusions, yes illusions. God has placed many illusions 
  in the way, to keep the heart and mind of the unperfected soul from penetrating 
  the excellent mystery within. Race is such an illusion. It seems to be such 
  a distraction to spiritual growth. The great paradox, however, is that at the 
  same time it is a means to it. The children of Light everywhere throughout the 
  earth have seen through the illusion (into the heart and soul), and have overcome. 
  (It comes so natural to children). The greater illusion, of course, is the entire 
  material realm itself, in which all of us live and breath, and have our being. 
  God has also made it to appear quite real, and in the lower of the Four Worlds, 
  the world of Action, it is real enough. The pain is real enough; the injustice 
  and oppression is real enough, the judgments are real enough, and the absence 
  of true love seems to be real enough also. (In the realm of the Kabbalah there 
  are Four descending worlds: Emanation, Creation, Formation and Action. Though 
  we dwell in all Four of them together, the lower world is the one apparent to 
  our physical senses. God has fixed and set it apart from the others to teach 
  us the very real lessons of life, of righteousness, and of justice and judgment--indeed, 
  in order to create in us the meaning and the lessons of Love itself. We could 
  not have inherited the heavens above, nor the world to come, any other way). 
  Returning now, as we have been, to the many dimensions of the Tree of Life in 
  which these worlds are revealed, we realize that this Tree is the primary archetype 
  of all existence and the very source of Life itself. We return to it because 
  we came from it--from the very Mind of the Universe that is. Every soul born 
  on earth, out of its own earthly mother's womb, is a child first of the Heavens 
  above:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Each soul has been sent into this world, not only for its own 
  sake but to facilitate the development of every other soul. We simply can not 
  do without each other. On an individual level, and in its own lifetime, each 
  soul must learn how to recognize, and how to commit itself to the very real 
  Presence of God who dwells in all things--not only in every higher dimension, 
  but in the sum of every natural and human event. <i>The Whole Earth is filled 
  with the Glory of God</i>. Nothing exists but God. God had to instruct <i>man 
  </i>in all of these things before They could set <i>him </i>free to inhabit 
  the worlds above and the world to come. Not having learned these lessons here 
  in these dimensions (in the great schoolhouse of Living Reality), we would invariably 
  commit these same transgressions in the next. It is in this lower world that 
  each of us are being created in God's image. What does God look like? She looks 
  like you my dear Black mother-sister. They look like everyone, everywhere, all 
  at once. (I refer to God as <i>They</i> because they are Father and Mother. 
  But <i>They</i>, of course, are ONE). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is in the context of these lessons that we understand and 
  interpret present world events. It is also in this context that we understand 
  the recent phenomenon of &quot;black rage&quot; (and by this we also imply &quot;Divine 
  Rage&quot;) against the American social order. For though God's controversy 
  is with all the nations of the earth, America is the primary focus of God's 
  creative work at this time in history, thus the final object of God's <i>righteous 
  anger</i>. God would have the whole world witness the end of a nation-empire 
  that--having conscripted (enslaved, of course, is the proper term) the precepts 
  of God to itself in order to further its own earthly ends--is founded upon a 
  historic violation of those very same precepts. (But how could it have acted 
  otherwise? The paradox is that what would not have happened if we had obeyed 
  God's precepts, had to happen because those very same precepts required it. 
  Thus America, a nation that had to come into existence so that it could witness 
  against itself, was founded in a state of almost total spiritual Darkness). 
  The true sons and daughters of Liberty were already a nation in 1776, one that 
  had already taken its rise in the time of Moses (and again in the time of Christ, 
  and again in the time of Muhammad), and which was slowly and secretly assembling 
  itself Westward in preparation for the Great Day of the Lord, a day that would 
  (and which has now) come upon the whole world. (see Matthew 3:3):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">A chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an HOLY NATION, 
    a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of Him who hath called 
    us out of darkness into His marvelous light...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Peter 2:9).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This great people, assembling themselves in every historical 
  way, out of every race, every nation, and every religious tradition on earth, 
  had no need for another nation to rise up in its place (or rather in God's place--for 
  the American nation has indeed taken the place of God in the hearts and minds 
  of the American people...and it seems almost more so at times, in the hearts 
  of many of the leading lights of Civil Rights movement). The spiritual Nation 
  had no need for another to rise up and set it more free than it already was, 
  as America's Founding Fathers attempted to (in the interest of enfranchised, 
  land-owning and mercantile white men that is), or to commission it beyond the 
  work it already had layed out before it--which was not the work of the nations 
  of men, nor of building an American empire, but the work of the Gospel of Christ. 
  (For those on the Judaic side of the Tree, the preservation of the Law. For 
  Islam, a breakthrough to the true meaning of holy war). How can it be, that 
  throughout the entire historical process very few gave thought to the words 
  that said: <i>I have layed a snare for thee O Babylon, and thou art taken, and 
  thou wast not aware </i>(Jeremiah 50:24; compare Revelation 18)? Of course, 
  the answer is found at 2 Thessalonians 2:11. Or to those which said:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">or to those that said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he 
    is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death...</font></i><font size="+1">(Exodus 
    21:16). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">or to those which quite plainly said of the founders of the 
  American nation:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they 
    allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that 
    were clean escaped from them who live in error.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">While they promise them liberty, they themselves are servants 
    of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in

  <p><i><font size="+1">For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world 
    through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again 
    entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the 
    beginning...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 Peter 2:18-22).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">To who else can these words apply at the end of the 20th century 
  than the hierarchy of the American religious and political order? The state 
  of spiritual deception--the spell under which so many had fallen, and which 
  continues even into these times--also explains why the average fearful citizen 
  is at a loss to understand the meaning of the great &quot;inner-city&quot; disorders 
  that have plagued America: drugs, robbery, murder, disregard for common civility, 
  for personal property, and for authority, not to fail to mention the so-called 
  &quot;problems&quot; of social welfare and &quot;illegitimate&quot; children, 
  which are also attributed by so many of the well-heeled in this nation to some 
  intrinsic lack of character among the poor and those of color. (There is, of 
  course, no such thing as an illegitimate child in the eyes of God. Every single 
  soul is foreordained, and brings a message from God into the world with it, 
  and a task that it must complete as it enters the material realm--even if it 
  only appears for a moment and returns). The words are also clear: <i>The curse 
  causeless shall not come</i>. As the mind thinks the body acts. When those above 
  are criminals and the companions of thieves the people below will be so also. 
  (Isn't anyone out there listening to the words)? Nor is it God's intention to 
  leave the poor of this earth piled up on top of each other, and crowded into 
  concentrated areas of poverty and despair as they are in America (1 Samuel 2:1-10)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And child-welfare programs--which the American economic and 
  political order had to be forced to enact, because of its own inherent disregard 
  for the teachings of Christ--has been a way in which God has been <i>setting 
  a table</i> for Their impoverished and displaced children <i>in the presence 
  of their enemies</i>. Woe to those who have tampered with it at the expense 
  of the poor. Woe to those who line their own pockets in the face of God's poor. 
  Woe to those who use the rhetoric of social concern and responsibility to enhance 
  their own political and social standing among the people and their own personal 
  well-being, while the <i>real-life </i>miseries and the state of servitude of 
  the people below increase). And please do not interpret the upward mobility 
  of blacks and others in America as a sign that some level of social justice 
  is being achieved. The lines of oppression are only being redrawn. These are 
  only unwittingly being enfranchised into the ranks of the oppressors and the 
  unjust. <i>Behold, these are the ungodly who prosper in the world. They increase 
  in riches. </i>(Psalm 73:12). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is also no coincidence that one of the primary paths, perhaps 
  <i>the </i>primary path, of upward mobility for blacks today is through the 
  military services. America is only too happy now, and <i>right proud, </i>to 
  place its own minorities (and this includes marginalized and working class whites) 
  on the front lines to protect its own vital economic interests, and primarily 
  the interests those who have either never served a day in military service themselves 
  (Dick Cheney for instance), or those who found ways of hiding in the reserves 
  and National Guard while others went off to do the nation's bloody business 
  (such as George W. Bush). (These two are included in <i>The New Hampshire Gazette's 
  </i>long list of mostly-Republican &quot;Chickenhawks&quot;). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> There is a great historical reality unfolding in the earth. 
  The end of the world? Yes, but not in the sense that skeptics and intellectual 
  critics define it, but in the apocalyptic sense no less. We have come to those 
  events that will separate the end of one age from the beginning of another. 
  Skeptics and critics should be greatly aware: God, the judge of all, is not 
  a capitalist. And most of all God is not an American. Neither is God a Christian, 
  a Jew or a Muslim. What God is, is Terrible. And one of His Holy Names is, in 
  fact, <i>AllaH, </i>and millions<i> </i>in the earth are bowed down to it in 
  absolute subjection. <i> </i>The Name itself has its meaning in the dimensions 
  of Tree of Life, intertwoven as it is with the names EL, YHVH and IHSOYS (Jesus). 
  Choose any path, however, and the word is the same: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent 
    perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: 
    for He that is higher than the highest regardeth: and there be higher than 
    they...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">There is a sore evil which I have seen under the Sun, 
    namely riches kept for the owners thereof to their own hurt...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ecclesiastes 
    5:8-13). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> It also explains why those who are already enfranchised in 
  the American order of things are by and large unwilling, or rather unable, to 
  lay any part of the blame for these social disorders at their own doorsteps. 
  They are <i>enfranchised</i>. They are <i>made members</i>. One will not be 
  against what they are for. Those caught mind-and-soul inside the order of things 
  can not see how each Tree is now bearing its own fruit, or how America, as the 
  last of the great biblical nation-empires of the earth, is now reaping exactly 
  what it has sown. (Genesis 15:12-16). America is founded in violence and warfare, 
  and ends in the same, (Revelation 13:8-10). </font></p>

<p align="center"><b>Proverbs 9:13-18; Isaiah 30:25; Joel, chapters 2 and 3</b>.</p>
<p><font size="+1">Why America? Can we not understand it in light of the ongoing 
  judgments of God against the Judeao-Christian world, judgments that began in 
  the most earthshaking ways with the World Wars of the 20th century? But why 
  America? It is also a matter of geography and, of course, history--6,000 years 
  of history. God had to choose some place on earth to bring all of these historic 
  matters to their conclusion, someplace on earth to bring the Light and the Darkness 
  to bear one upon the other, both in their perfected and mutually powerful forms. 
  America, unlike any other nation on earth lies in the pathway of this great 
  Solar/Lunar epic, and completes the story from Genesis to Revelation. It is 
  the beginning of the story and the end of it. Thus the Great Paradox we call 
  America--the land of Shadows and Images, the land of the greatest potential 
  for Good, but nevertheless a very present Evil in the earth--fulfills the words:<i> 
  Let the two of them </i>(the spirits of Cain and Abel) <i>grow together until 
  the harvest</i>.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The American people, laboring in both the Light and the <i>thick 
  </i>Darkness, caught in the complex relationship between the two, have also 
  failed to connect the events of September 11th with the very existence of the 
  towers themselves, which those in a right spiritual frame of mind would not 
  have built to begin with (Psalm 48:11-14). Only the most insightful associated 
  their collapse with the judgments of God, and even fewer could see them in light 
  of the words at Psalm 18:1-10, or Deuteronomy, chapter 32. Conversely, where 
  were all the religious leaders when these things happened, when this <i>Divine 
  Theophany</i> unfolded before the eyes of the whole world? As confused, and 
  as entangled as anyone else in the course thicket of the American economic, 
  political and religious order of things, many of them, nevertheless, appeared 
  on the talk shows. And hardly wanting to offend anyone (or to risk waking anyone 
  up), they equivocated the meaning of it all away--giving no place to God in 
  any of these matters. Despite what many of them might have really believed in 
  the hearts, they expressed instead (in the misguided interest of further social 
  progress no doubt) their indignation against those <i>Islamic</i> extremists 
  who displayed, it was obvious, no respect for the American way of life. (The 
  ultimate reality is that God Himself has no abiding respect for the American 
  way of life...Isaiah 40:15-26). And in so doing fulfilled the word, and kept 
  <i>Agag alive</i>. (1 Samuel 15:1-23, KJV). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The people, fast asleep in the American Dream, have failed 
  to associate any of the country's disorders with the words at Leviticus 26, 
  and therefore to the presence of <a href="../UsedImages/pg297.gif">that great 
  stone and copper idol</a> standing so mystically and majestically in the middle 
  of New York harbor, or to the thousands of other stone images that fill the 
  land...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(There is a great difference between an image of a Buddha, 
  or an image of some divine principle in human or geometrical form, such as a 
  mandala or a crucifix, and an image of George Washington or Abraham Lincoln, 
  or some Union or Confederate soldier, complete with canon, flag and sword, raised 
  up in the center of town. The one elevates the consciousness, the other ensnares 
  the mind). Of course there are very few images in the land that are overty dedicated 
  to the institution of slavery. But the flags and the monuments to the Confederate 
  cause throughout the south stand there in their place, and serve as a reminder 
  of the ways the idea of slavery was instituted and defended in the past. But 
  it is the plaques and the monuments dedicated to the great names of the American 
  political, economic and industrial order, and the great works of art they have 
  sponsored in their own names, and the great cities they have built, attesting 
  to their own earthly accomplishments, that speak volumes to the truly enlightened 
  mind, of the ways the institution of slavery is organized and defended in our 
  time. As the impending crisis unfolds, as the people actually begin to obey 
  the Spirit and <i>Come out of Babylon</i>, as the American corporate order begins 
  to collapse, it will defend what it believes is its inherited right to order 
  the thinking, and exploit the labors of others with a vehemence practically 
  unimagined by the leaders of Old South (or the North). The American military 
  and police state has come into existence, and has been brought to its present 
  state of readiness (even against its own conscious will), for the very purpose 
  of defending the ruling Capitalist order against God. (It's not a conspiracy, 
  it is the work of God itself). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Does this image in New York harbor, the one that captures the 
  imagination of millions of passers by and vistors to that city each year, represent 
  Liberty? To many it does. Many have given their lives for it. To many other 
  discerning and oppressed individuals it ultimately represents a lie--<i>the</i> 
  lie. It certainly represents a natural and historic disregard for the precepts 
  of the Torah. (So why should, say a true Torah-observant Jew--even in their 
  own adherence to the American mythos--take Christianity serious? After all, 
  America does claim to be a <i>Christian </i> nation). Be circumspect in these 
  matters the Law says. Studying this image from every angle, we see that it definetly 
  does not represent the form of freedom, or liberty, wherein each of us have 
  been called to stand (see Galatians 5 and 1 Peter 2:16), but another fallen 
  image of it, which releases and legitimizes man's basest instincts to do evil, 
  to forget his own maker, to find ways to become rich and famous, to build towers 
  in one's own honor, to fill the land with oppression, and to enslave and conscript 
  others into their service, and to take exultant pride in the exercise of it 
  all. It represents the highest notion unregenerated man can make of the idea 
  of liberty. True liberty sets the soul free (regardless of its own earthly circumstances) 
  to do good and not evil. It also sets the mind free to correctly interpret the 
  spiritual import of these times, indeed, to even care about such an interpretation 
  in the first place. It is as the Word says: <i>If Christ shall set you free, 
  ye shall be free indeed</i>. The mind set spiritually free can readily associate 
  the people's sojourn here at the Western ends of the earth with the words in 
  Deuteronomy, chapters 26 to 32. If it cannot it is because it is either completely 
  innocent of it all (and shall not be held altogether in account for it), or

<p><font size="+1">And so neither is the <i>hair of wool</i> the hair of any human 
  being or race of people. It is the hair of the Ram. (Daniel 8:3). The Ram is 
  a symbol of the Divine Father, under whose watchful and corrective guidance 
  the children of I-SRA-El took their rise 4,000 years ago at the time of Abraham 
  (during the Vedic age), and again 2,000 years later under the symbol of the 
  Lamb of God. The Ram (present in the sign of Aries), symbolizes all the powers 
  of the East which the Father has reserved for Himself against the Day of Judgment. 
  The children that went forth out of the East (in the form of the Universal Body 
  of Christ), are symbolized by a Lamb because their ultimate mission in this 
  age is to lay down their lives, and to die--not only the first death (the death 
  of the old nature) but the second death as well. (And then to rise again, Romans 
  8:31-39). And this, so that the prince of this world--the spirit of Antichrist 
  in the earth--might be manifest in the end. And also that the pathway that leads 
  out of the dimensions of this world into the eternal dimensions might be manifest 
  as well. Only those with true Soul-force can pass through. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Ram symbolizes the figure of Brahma, the Great Father, 
  who returned to the West in the Hebrew mysteries. He appears there in the name 
  of Abram, or Abraham. The sign is revealed in the precessions of the ages through 
  which history has passed since then. We are now passing into the age of Aquarius, 
  and all the events of our times are a sign of it. (Luke 22:9-12). About two 
  thousand years ago the world entered the age of Pisces--the sign of the Two 
  Fishes. (These are the Two Fishes with which Christ has been feeding the multitudes). 
  About two thousand years before that, in the time of BRAHMA (Abrahm), the world 
  entered the age of Aries. It is at that time in history that the symbols of 
  this great Heavenly Circle--these Twelve signs--were affixed in the Hebrew system 
  of thought. Roughly two thousand years (or Forty periods of Jubilees) before 
  that, the Circle of Genesis began with the age of Taurus in the garden of Eden. 
  We have returned to this place again, as it says of the great Ox, Behemoth: 
  <i>The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willow of the brook compass 
  him about. Behold, he drinketh up a river...he trusteth that he can draw up 
  Jordan into his mouth. </i>(Job 40:21-23).</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg202Aprint.gif" width="673" height="428"></p>
<p align="center"><b>The continent of North America is the Great Ox, Behemoth. 
  (Job 40:15-24).</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">And we see why it is said that Christ's Feet were made of &quot;bronze&quot; 
  (or brass). The place of the Feet of the Mystery of Christ on the World Tree 
  symbolize things that are coming to pass here at the Western ends of the earth 
  (see Romans 10:15); and because bronze is an alloy, or a mixture of substances 
  made stronger when they are joined together, so the children of God are likewise 
  coming to perfection in Christ as God molds them together in the great spiritual 
  fires that try men's souls--dross out, purity in. One kind alone makes a very 
  weak substance. (Open the Book of 1 Peter).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Caucasian race, nevertheless, will concede some thoughts 
  on the charge of leprosy and the curse that attends it, because we can also 
  perceive the demographic, and historical as well as racial implications if you 
  will, in the dimensions of the oracles. The charges have nothing to do with 
  physical, or racial characteristics however (such things are the work of Nature 
  and cannot be changed, and need not be <i>cured</i>), but everything to do with 
  the state of the Soul and the condition of the heart. We see in the oracles 
  that the visage of the Mystery of Christ (the Angel of the Lord's Presence) 
  appears in a very distinct form to fill up the spaces on the World Tree northward 
  and westward, as it is written: <i>From the rising of the Sun even unto the 
  going down of the same shall my Name be great among the Gentiles. </i>(Malachi 
  1:11)...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>The Higher Egypt</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Spiritual Sun came up out of Egypt in the time of Moses, 
  and again in the time of Christ, energizing the entire history of Europe--for 
  both good and evil (mostly evil it seems...2 Thessalonians 2:7)--in its path 
  to these Western ends of the earth. It rose up out of Egypt, but it is also 
  setting in Egypt. It is setting in America, the original <a href="SideLinks/HeavenlyNile.htm">source 
  of the mysteries of Egypt</a>. For Egypt is a spiritual concept, and the land 
  we associate with Egypt today is a cosmic reflection-below of the greater mystery-above, 
  and is a symbol, not only of the Human body itself but of the entire Lower World 
  through which the mind of Israel is presently sojourning, and from which it 
  must be still be delivered. (The events described in the Book of Exodus did 
  not happen in the literal sense, but rather they have been <i>happening</i> 
  in the epic, historical and spiritual sense, from one end of this epic story 
  to the other). Egypt is the base upon which the whole mystery of Darkness has 
  been set. It extends on the Oracle from the Upper kingdom in the East to the 
  Lower kingdom in the West, as it is written:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, 
    by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and 
    there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no 
    man shall buy (redeem) you...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 27:68; 
    Genesis 15:13,14).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The whole of it also gives epic meaning to those words that 
  apply to everyone--male and female alike--who have ever given their lives in 
  the cause of true justice, or who have ever died in the light of the Mystery 
  of Christ (a number which includes untold numbers of Caucasian people in addition 
  to the untold numbers of others of every other race whose lives were taken from 
  them, and whose lives were offered willingly, over the course of this entire 
  age), and who must still fill up this number in our time: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the 
    Great City, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord 
    was crucified. </i>(Revelation 11:8). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">When I mentioned that all of us here in the West have come 
  down to Egypt together, and that each of us are still subject to the spirit 
  of <i>Pharaoh</i> in our time (please understand Ezekiel 31 and 32), one man, 
  challenging the notion of a collective and shared state of slavery, said: &quot;Are 
  you trying to diminish the meaning of the black experience in America? Are you 
  trying to say that the white man was a slave like the black man, and that God 
  is calling him to rise up just as he is calling the black man?&quot; One of 
  the holdings of the Black Revisionist Movement is that Abraham, Moses, Jesus, 
  and the true children of Israel were all black, and that the White race by force 
  and cunning stole this heritage, conscripting the stories to itself, and now 
  here I was, it seemed to him, stealing the meaning of the slave experience and 
  trying to apply it to the White race as well. Of course, had this brother been 
  reading all the history books at our disposal he would have learned that the 
  white man has been enslaving his own kind, just as the black man has been enslaving 
  his own kind, long before our common experience here in America. The word <i>slave</i> 
  (from <i>Slav</i>) comes directly from the white man's own earlier and personal 
  experiences with the institution of slavery. And as such one has only to look 
  back over the history of America to see what a slave the white man has been, 
  and that to his very own lower nature. <i>Whosoever committeth sin is the servant</i> 
  (the slave)<i> of sin. </i>(John 8:34). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The nature of the white man's slavery is that he does not even 
  realize he is a slave. He has been given flags and slogans, and material things 
  and entertainment to sustain him--to keep him unaware of it. He cannot realize 
  how the strongest chains of all are the Chains of Ignorance. These have been 
  prepared by God for the rulers of this world, and for those who yield to them. 
  Understand Revelation 20:1-5. (The &quot;thousand years&quot; in this verse 
  is also symbolic of the times in which we live, and of the years that have already 
  reached their conclusion. Understand 2 Peter 3:8-13; Psalm 90:1-4). The American 
  experience has not only served to expose the darkest and most subtle nature 
  of European civilization to the world at large, as well as to heighten the spiritual 
  life of the African soul in the process, but it has served in the end to expose 
  the darkest nature of humanity in general to humanity itself. Thus the American 
  experience has provided a final vantage place, for both personal as well as 
  collective self discovery. It has also provided a high place from which the 
  Children of Light can look out upon the rest of the world, to survey the work 
  that lies before them after the judgments of America are complete. (Revelation 
  22:1-6).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Of course the eyes of the rest of the world are focused on 
  America as well. It is the creative focus of God's intentions in the earth at 
  this time in history. Both good and evil are coming to perfection here. Out 
  of this great cultural mix, stirred by all of the social, political, and economic 
  forces of our times, will the true people of God emerge--the true Holy Nation. 
  It is these who will go forth to restore the earth. These will be all of those 
  who have confronted and overcome both their own personal sins as well as the 
  historical transgressions of Israel as a people (for sin and bondage come in 
  many complex forms and with many faces). They will come from every race and 
  religious tradition, and fulfill the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For ask now of the days that are past, which were before 
    thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from one 
    side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been such a thing as this 
    great thing is, or hath been heard like it?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of 
    the midst of the Fire, as thou hast heard, and live?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Or hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation from the 
    midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by 
    war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, 
    according to all that the Lord did for you in Egypt before your eyes.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that 
    the Lord He is God; there is none else beside Him...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 
    4:32-35).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">But why, we must ask ourselves, does the European seem to be 
  the most sinful of all, the most decadent, the most violent and destructive, 
  the evilest? And, again, we look into the oracles for the answer. We discover 
  the Dragon (Revelation 12:9), and its whereabouts--right there in the center 
  of Europe. (See Isaiah, chapters 27 to 29). And we discover, or imply, that 
  it's not because he is devoid of God's Holy Spirit, as the man on Fulton Mall 
  insisted, but because he is also very intricately connected to the covenant 
  of God &quot;for both good and evil.&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:26-32). He has been 
  made to dwell upon the high places of the earth, and upon the fattest places, 
  thus he has also been made to bear upon his own historic shoulders this great 
  burden of Darkness--for which he is clearly guilty as the whole world attests, 
  and for which he is to be judged--but, for which he is also called to repent. 
  Thus he is intricately connected to the plan of redemption as well. Seeing the 
  dimensions of the Christ Mystery spanning the age, passing out of the East, 
  across Europe to the West, we can begin to understand the import of the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">(For) Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, 
    being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth 
    on a tree...</font></i><font size="+1">(Galatians 3:10-13).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I myself wish at times that I could be absolved of the curse 
  (the curse of whiteness as it is), but I accept God's decrees. I am not interested 
  in defending the caucasian race, and find myself standing awkwardly silent and 
  in general agreement when it is being attacked by others, trying to distance 
  myself somehow from the accusations. Of course I am complicit, everyone is complicit 
  in the structure and complexities of evil, but I have also repented of it all, 
  as have thousands upon thousands of others. Nevertheless, just recently I received 
  a letter from a Cheyenne taking me to task for &quot;accusing&quot; him, as 
  he said, &quot;of not seeing the big picture.&quot; It was in response to a 
  chapter in this work entitled <i>A Journey of Atonement</i>. He wrote:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I read your response to my endeavor to protect my peoples ways. Accusing 
    me of not seeing the big picture. Wrong my friend, my people are the only 
    ones that truely understand the big picture. We have suffered through all 
    your people have had to offer since 1492. We have survived the massacre at 
    Sandcreek, 1864, led by your Christian Minister--Col. Chivington--who made 
    the infamous statement: &quot;Kill all, children, elderly, women, nits make 
    lice!&quot; We didn't ask for your Christian beliefs, hell you people killed 
    the man that offered you peace and life!!! So please do not accuse me of not 
    knowing or seeing the so called &quot;Big Picture.&quot; Because my people 
    have been seeing it for centuries, and our religion and faith are all we have 
    left. And friend over my dead body will you get that from me. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

<p><font size="+1"> At the recent protest gathering around the issue of reparations 
  for African-Americans, held in Washington, D.C., during August, 2002, a Brooklyn 
  councilman who said of himself: &quot;I am not a politician, I am an elected 
  revolutionary,&quot; also said: &quot;I'm angry, I'm mad. I might just walk 
  up to the first white man I see and slap him, just for my own mental health.&quot; 
  (?) Was he including the number of whites in the crowd that day who had also 
  come to support the work of N'COBRA, (the National Coalition Of Blacks for Reparations 
  in America)? Would he slap those who have served the Civil Rights movement over 
  the years in what ever capacity they have been able to, or allowed to? or those 
  who are on the front lines of the antiwar and anti globalism movements of our 
  time? or those who are on the front lines of the environmental movement? What 
  does he mean by &quot;white man?&quot; Racism works in reverse also. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the &quot;cursed one&quot; is not only the Universal Christ 
  who has come bearing in his cosmic folds both the good and the evil in the world 
  (the spirit of Light and the spirit of Darkness, the spirit of Christ as well 
  as the spirit of Antichrist), but it can be any one of the followers of Christ 
  in the world, regardless of race, to whom the words also apply which say:</font></p>

  mind), into the circle of these great historical events. The circle began in 
  Eden, took its course Eastward after the <i>Fall</i>, and then finally back 
  to the Americas again in the Mystery of Christ. (Please see Hebrews 2:11). The

<p><font size="+1">The mysteries of Egypt--which flowed out of the Western Eden 
  in ancient times--were translated into the precepts of the Torah. (Please refer 
  to that &quot;well-worn&quot; text at Acts 7:22). The Angel of the Lord (Exodus 
  23:20-23; 24:10), whose Presence is revealed in the epic context of this same 
  Sacred Law, as well as in the motions of the great Solar Wheel, AND in the unfolding 
  context of present world events, exchanged identities with Jehoshua (one of 
  the primary archetypes of the Hebrew literary tradition). The children of Israel, 
  in turn, adopted the Divine Persona, and became to the world what they perceived 
  in the spiritual realm, as it is written: <i>Let them that love God be as the 
  Sun when He goeth forth in His might. </i>(Judges 5:31). And: <i>He shall bring 
  forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the Noonday. </i>(Psalm 
  37:6). The <i>noonday</i> refers to the realization that the ancient City of 
  David is not in the East where the Sun rises at the time of Passover, but in 
  the North, in the center of Europe, where the disk of the Great Sun comes to 
  the place named Beauty on the World Tree. (Understand Matthew 24:32). Thus Paul 
  will say:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Is the white man smitten with leprosy? Yes, but it is not evidenced 
  by the color of his skin. It is rather evidenced by his deeds. The Western political, 
  religious, and economic order has indeed been a fretting and rising plague in 
  the great Body of the Mystery of Christ--one that has been rising in the world 
  since the time of Cain in the garden of Eden, thus one against which God has 
  also been rising in all the other powers of the earth since those same ancient 
  times. World Capitalism, while it constantly tries to readjust its energies 
  so as to pass itself off as the cure itself, is the final stage of this disease. 
  The better life seems to become because of it, the more evil (deceptive, not 
  to mention destructive) it actually is. Thus the priest is instructed to look 
  &quot;deep&quot; into the skin. (Leviticus 13:1-3). Is the white man alone in 
  his affliction? Not any longer. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The root of this deception, this &quot;confusion,&quot; stems, 
  as we said, from the time of Adam, when the Darkness (along with the Light) 
  emerged out of the doctrines of Adam to half-govern the mind of the ancient 
  Vedic/Egyptian/Hebrew world...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/UpperNile.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The disease came right along with the children of Israel as 
  they began to come up out of the East in the time of Moses, as it was also written: 
  <i>Beware in a plague of leprosy... Remember what the Lord did to Miriam by 
  the way, after ye were come forth out of Egypt. </i>(Deuteronomy 24:8,9). Miriam 
  was smitten with leprosy when she and Aaron protested Moses' marriage to the 
  <i>Ethiopian woman</i>. To understand the epic meaning of it all one must, of 
  course, find themselves back in the garden, back at the roots of the Tree of 
  Life in the land of Ethiopia. (Genesis 2:13). It will soon be plain to see that 
  the Scriptures are not referring to that Ethiopia, to that land lying near the 
  headwaters of the river Nile in the East--but to this original land of Ethiopia 
  here in America, the place referred to in the Book of Genesis, the land situated 
  at the site of <a href="../UsedImages/pg2mapprint.gif">the ancient Garden</a>, 
  near the original source of the (Heavenly) Nile. </font><font size="+1">(Please 
  see Chapter 2, and the sub-chapter entitled Heavenly Nile). The <i>Ethiopian 
  woman</i>, we discover, is the entire &quot;Nation-Church,&quot; the people 
  collectively, all who have returned in these fulness of times to this ancient 
  place at the Western end of the earth, as well as all those who were already 
  here. (2 Corinthians 11:1-4). She is every color, and will appear in the holy 
  garments of every religious tradition and every people; for all the children 
  of God, from all the corners of the earth, are coming to the rites of the Sacred 
  Marriage in the mystery of Christ... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Miram and Aaron, as the allegory goes, wanted this perfection 
  for themselves, for their own race as it is, in their own times. They said: 
  <i>Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? Hath He not also spoken by us?...And 
  the Lord heard it. </i>(Numbers 12:2). <i>And Miriam was shut out of the camp 
  SEVEN days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. </i>(12:15). 
  The answer in this matter is that the Lord had <i>not</i> spoken by them, nor 
  does the Lord speak through any who hold a racially or religiously exclusive 
  doctrine (no matter whether it be exclusively white or black, Christian or Jewish, 
  or any other). Thus Miriam was put out of the camp figuratively, even to our 
  very own day. There is only one true spiritual race in the world, and only one 
  true Holy Nation, and it has not risen up yet. We must all beware in a plague 
  of leprosy.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You will remember that young black man who walked into the 
  very warm conversation you and I were having with the Hasidic Jewish man. He 
  stepped up to inform the Hasid who the &quot;true Jews&quot; really are. &quot;I 
  know, I know,&quot; said the Hasid, &quot;you are going to tell me that I am 
  not a Jew.&quot; But with his eyes he intoned: &quot;Messiah will decide.&quot; 
  No truer thought on the matter could be expressed, for the true Jews will be 
  known on that day. They will be known by their observances of the true meanings 
  of the Law and the Prophets, but particularly by their love...not only for God 
  and the things of God, but for each other and all others. They will be known 
  by each other--true Jew, true Christian, true Muslim, true Brahmin, true Bodhi, 
  true Warrior...Black as a Heavenly Night, Yellow as a Solar Morning, White as 
  a Clear Day, and Red as the Evening Sun, and every beautiful (bronze) shade 
  in between. There will be only One True Religion and One Spirit. Each of us--you 
  a Black sister, dressed in your beautiful Muslim garments, (clothed in reverent 
  devotion to the One Creator who you so lovingly call Papa), me, appearing to 
  be of no serious religious persuasion at all, and the pious Jew in his ritual 
  clothing which set him apart from other Jews--were, nevertheless, fully appreciative 
  of the others' religious expression. The self-certain young man revealed himself 
  when he tried to divide this fellowship, and fell into God's trap. It was obvious 
  that he lacked any understanding of this text at 1 Kings 3:16-28, or of the 
  dimensions of the World Tree, of the principles of Kabbalah, or of the history 
  of Judaism as it took its rise from the time of Christ. (Romans 11). It was 
  obvious that he lacked an understanding of the meaning of the coming of Messiah. 
  But in one thing he was correct? Is the Black man a true Jew? Indeed he is, 
  when he walks in the precepts of God's Law:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is 
    that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision 
    is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is 
    not of men, but of God...</font></i><font size="+1">(Romans 2:28,29). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The true Deliver is the Lord--the Lord of Glory whose Presence 
  fills up the sum of all spiritual reality, and the sum of all present natural 
  and human events. All the scriptures must be understood in that light. And on 
  earth the anointed ones for this time shall be discovered at the place named 
  Majesty on the World Tree here in the West. All the literary symbolism in the 
  Scriptures must be followed to this place and to this moment in time, wherein 
  all things must be fulfilled. This age, as such, will draw to its own conclusion,

<p align="center">THE SYMBOLIC COMPARISON OF THE JEWS AND THE MOON</p>
<p align="center">By Rabbi Avrohom Berger</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>With the approach of the month of Nisan, we read the special Parshah of This 
    month is for you the first of the months of the year, because the month in 
    which the Jewish people were redeemed from Egyptian slavery is the first and 
    foremost in the Jewish year. It is the time when the world was created, when 
    the patriarchs were born, and when we shall again be freed from our present 
    exile. (Others have attributed these things to the time of the New Moon of 
    the Seventh Month). </p>
  <p>The Talmud tells us (Sukah 29) that the Jewish calendar is based upon the 
    Lunar Month, while the nations of the world count their years according to 
    the Sun. Where in the Torah is there any indication that the Moon is the principal 
    element upon which our time-reckoning is founded? The Hebrew word for the 
    a month is Codesh, which means new or renewal. Because the Moon gives off 
    no light of its own, it is reflecting the light of the Sun. Each month the 
    Moon is born again. As the Moon and earth move along in their orbits, more 
    of the Moon's sunlit part is seen, until it shines as a Full Moon. Then less 
    and less of the sunlit part is seen, until the dark New Moon appears <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(in 
    the West)</font>.</p>
  <p>All our holidays are based upon the Moon, the heavenly body that revolves 
    around the earth once in about 29 and a quarter days...The Midrash (Exodus) 
    sees in the rythm and orbit of the Moon a similarity and reflection of Jewish 
    history. Just as the Moon increases its light until it reaches a complete 
    fulness by the 15th of the month, and then it gradually diminishes until it 
    becomes dark, so it is with the Jewish nation. With the appearance of the 
    first Jew--Avraham Avinu--on the world scene, the world began to be illuminated 
    by the spark of G-dliness. The decendants of Avraham advanced the Jewish idea. 
  </p>
  <p>In the time of Moshe Rabeinu, a Torah nation was created. And in the 16th 
    generation from Avraham, Judaism reached its highest point in the reign of 
    King Solomon, whose fame and wisdom spread throughout the world, and who built 
    the first Temple. The Jewish Moon was full.</p>
  <p>Then the decline began. With the ascending to the throne of Solomon's son, 
    king Rehoboam, the Jewish kingdom was split in two <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(and 
    Ephraim went backwards)</font>, and the deterioration lasted another 15 generations, 
    until the time of king Zedekiah, the 30th generation from Avraham, when the 
    independent Jewish State disappeared with the destruction of the Beth Ha-mikdash, 
    and the exile of the Jewish people.</p>
  <p>In the prayer of the Sanctification of the Moon, we find another resemblance 
    of the Jewish people to the Moon. &quot;Just as the Moon is renewed, so the 
    Jewish people will be renewed,&quot; meaning that even in the darkest hour 
    we shouldn't despair. We always have the spiritual strength and vigor to liberate 
    ourselves from the dreary and gloomy situations in which we sometimes find 
    ourselves <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Daniel 12, for instance)</font>, 
    and resume the struggle to revitalize ourselves and to flourish and thrive 
    again.</p>
  <p>Since all of our beloved holidays are dependent upon the date of the Jewish 
    month, the Rabbinical Court had to determine each month in accordance with 
    halachic procedures, the day when the new month will begin. The Talmud relates 
    (Rosh Hashana 25a) that once, when the Roman (read American) authorities prohibited 
    the Jewish sages to proclaim officially when the new month will start, in 
    order that the Jews shouldn't be able to celebrate the holidays, R. Yahuda 
    Hanasie sent R. Chiya to a certain small town to establish the precise time 
    when the New Moon was seen, and when Rosh Chodesh will be. Since this had 
    to be kept secret, they made up that in case the mission will be successful, 
    R. Chiya should send the news in the code words of &quot;DAVID, THE KING OF 
    ISRAEL IS ALIVE AND EXISTING.&quot; Rashi explains that David is compared 
    to the Moon, because the renewal of the Moon brings with it the hope and expectation 
    that the kingdom of David will be reborn.</p>
  <p>This as also the reason, that at the Blessing of the Chodesh we appeal to 
    G-d, that He &quot;should redeem us in the near future, and gather us from 
    the Four corners of the world.&quot; Since the emergence of the New Moon represents 
    and embodies the idea of our national rejuvination and our hopes and dreams 
    for redemption, so we pour out our hearts to Hashem and urge Him to transform 
    the concept of the Jewish comparison to the Moon, into the concrete reality 
    of actual redemption, and to make it an accomplished fact. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

<p><font size="+1">The young man's contention was that the black man is the &quot;natural 
  branch&quot; of this mystery, and that the &quot;so-called&quot; Jew has drained 
  for himself the milk of God's word that was intended for the black man alone. 
  The idea is as racist, and historically short-sighted as those of the orthodox 
  Jewish man who approached me one day to tell me that I was wasting my time, 
  that God's blessings are to be conferred upon Israel alone, meaning the &quot;Jews&quot; 
  alone, and that my interpretation of the Kabbalah, which makes of Israel a universal 
  nation, is a corruption of the precepts of the Kabbalah as they were taught 
  by the sages of Israel. Of course, because these things were sealed from the 
  sages of Israel (with Seven seals), as they were from the &quot;fathers&quot; 
  of Christianity. Neither knew anything of the central mysteries of Israel, or 
  of the pathways the secret Oral Traditions took as they made their way throughout 
  the world in ancient times (and indeed, down into Africa whose religious and 
  social traditions, and those of the North, were made to be mirror image of the 
  other--just as the mysteries of the East are reflections of the mysteries of 
  the West). Neither Judaism or Christianity were aware of (the core of) their 
  own secret traditions, or of the history of those Essenes whose kabbalistic 
  doctrines found their way into both the Gospels and the teachings of Rabbinic 
  Judaism after those times...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Actually, Kadijah, I will be just as ecstatic if the anointed 
  ones are Black, or if one of them is. We know this much, however: God is not 
  in the racial game. The Messiahs will appear out of that same natural branch 
  of Judaism to which the oracles of God were first committed. They will appear 
  from the Judaic side of the Tree of Life, bearing witness to the Universal Mystery 
  of Christ, and the whole world will be humbled. (I told you about the Hasidim 
  of Eastern Parkway who threatened to beat me up if I did not get out of their 
  neighborhood, right in front of a giant poster saying: &quot;The Messiah is 
  Coming.&quot; Be assured, the Messiahs will not arise from there, or rather, 
  from them. They will not appear from any faction of Judaism that espouses the 
  Zionist cause, or the &quot;Jewish&quot; cause alone). This marriage, and the 
  manifestation of God's anointed ones, is understood in the numerical and hieroglyphic 
  dimensions of the name D.V.D.--two Dalets joined together by a Vaw (or Waw) 
  in the universal Mandala of the Tree of Life...</font></p>

  Dalai Lama has been chosen over the last several hundered years), and through 
  the institution of Holy Marriage to every race of peoples on earth. The succeeding 
  Anointed Ones shall be chosen from the South, East, West, and then North again, 
  one after the other--forever--until the world is satisfied that the kingdom 
  of God has truly arrived on earth, and has come among all peoples). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Throne of David will be the focus of our thoughts, but 
  not the object of them. We will not be taught to contend for such an office 
  as the children of America are taught: &quot;Why you could grow up to become 
  the President of the United States&quot; they are told. This will free us from 
  the delusions of power that we as a people suffer from today. (For such power, 
  and such an office, must be a burden, not an aspiration). It will also free 
  us from the complex of servitude, as we learn to treat and respect, to revere 
  each other as truly equals in the sight of God. We will pass from a pyramidal 
  state of mind to a circular. For even those who are called to this office by 
  the Spirit will acknowledge the greatest among us to be the least among us. 
  It will be their constant responsibility to remind us of our own nobility, of 
  our own Christlikeness, not their own. We will serve them in proportion to the 
  way in which they serve God, and us. Heaven will insist on it. In their relationship 
  to each other, as well as to us, they will serve as a living symbol of the principles 
  of Divine Union between Heaven and Earth. They will also serve as a constant 
  reminder of our own spiritual centers--of the realization that the way into 
  this universe and out of it again exists in the depths of every single soul. 
  The Law will issue forth from Zion in exactly the same measure as right and 
  balanced thought issues forth from the heart and mind of every other perfected 
  soul on earth. The Anointed Ones will keep us ever-mindul of the Christ in each 
  of us, and of the words: <i>I am the Tao, the Dharma, and the Chi, The Way, 
  the Truth, and the Life</i>, (John 14:6). </font></p>

  and is being judged for it, as is the Zionist state of Israel in the East, as 
  will the Mormons in the West and every other group or sect that imagines that 
  it alone is the &quot;chosen&quot; one. But what is God to make of such efforts 
  as the &quot;Lost-Found Nation of Islam On Behalf of All So-Called African Americans?&quot; 
  It too is in violation of this precept. It too, not long ago, declared itself 
  to be--not merely one nation called out from among other nations (and particularly 
  from among the American nation), but--&quot;the&quot; nation, &quot;chosen of 
  God above all other nations.&quot; The following are excerpts from the March,

    and unparalleled in time. A New Nation is dawning by the power of the &quot;Son.&quot; 
    (Isaiah 55:4,5). As of the day of this writing, within the last two weeks, 
    the Supreme Leader and Teacher of the Lost-Found Nation of Islam, Our brother, 
    the Honourable Silas Muhammad, sat in the renown and internationally respected 
    walls of the Peace Palace located in the Hague. This was a historic day for 
    each and every Black man, woman, and child in the Americas, and especially

    up and flown as the flag of our nation. The flag was brought to Black people 
    in 1930 by Almighty Allah in person, Master Fard Muhammad, to whom praises 
    are forever due. What! Indeed a historic moment...</p>
  <p>It was prophesied, &quot;He will lift up an ensign from afar.&quot; (Isaiah 
    5:26). This prophecy, in the lifting up and establishment of the &quot;Holy 
    Flag&quot; in the international forum is a sign to you. Measure your leaders 
    by what they do of &quot;real worth and truth.&quot; This is not a game, a 
    Broadway play, nor a time for actors! This is the time for God in person and 
    a nation of Gods to show and manifest the strength of their powers!</p>
  <p>Hold high the flag of the Lost-Found Nation of Islam! Plant the staff down 
    deeply that it does not sway! The spiritual dawn is rising, vice-versing itself.

    They have also tried, and will try to slander and diminish him in the public

  &quot;chosen&quot; than any of the other nations of the earth. Such a recognition 
  needs to come from God alone--or rather, from God first. Then it will come from 
  men. But if the Lost-Found Nation of Islam is content to be simply counted as 
  one among all the other nations, of equal status (as the Zionist State of Israel 
  in the East was first content), it must be reminded that <i>the Lord's indignation 
  is against them all. </i>(Isaiah 34:1,2). <i>Truly in vain is salvation hoped 
  for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains. </i>(Jeremiah 3:2). 
  The Lord has a controversy with the nations, the small as well as the great, 
  and it can hardly make a difference if they are very old or just born (too soon). 
  Compared to the excellent state of mind God is creating in the true Holy Nation 
  all other nations are counted to him as less than nothing. (Again, see Isaiah 
  40:15-17). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Just as the American nation &quot;borrowed&quot; the precept 
  of <i>e pluribus unum </i>from holy writ (Isaiah 13:4), so sadly enough the 
  Lost-Found Nation of Islam has left it behind. &quot;This is no game,&quot; 
  it declares, &quot;no play.&quot; It appears, however, from an eye cast upon 
  other episodes in Amerian history, that--with all of this conferring of nationhood, 
  titles, and ranks upon itself, and investing itself with a sense of its own 
  importance out of proportion to the reality--that it is playing the same biblical 
  and spiritually-childlike games, and with the same notions of &quot;chosen peopleness,&quot; 
  and marching around in the same kinds of uniforms, as the Mormons in the 1800s. 
  One will recall that Blacks were excluded from the Mormon priesthood then, as 
  Whites are presently and clearly excluded from the leading ranks of the Nation 
  of Islam today. The times are far more critical now for the birth of true understanding. 
  And just as the doctrines of the Church of the Latter Day Saints fell far short 
  in the 1830s, and still falls far short of the necessary understanding of these 
  times (not realizing how God was setting them apart as a microcosm of the entire 
  American experience, of the entire American religious, political, and military 
  state of mind)...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...the Nation of Islam falls just as short--also imagining 
  as it does that God has gone to all of this historic trouble for them and their 
  followers alone. Even Malcom X had grown weary of such a doctrine. (And, as 
  we know, payed a martyr's price for it; as did Dr. King about the same time 
  as he was waking up to an understanding of the intrinsic evil of the political 
  order that he was leading the people into. Had the two of them lived on, and 
  seen fully <i>eye to eye, </i>they would have eventually come together to call 
  the people &quot;out&quot; of the American order as the Scriptures command. 
  The order would have collapsed, and something approaching the new would have 
  been born. But it was not time yet. The Beast was still too powerful and too 
  subtle (<i>For who is like unto the beast...?</i>), and the material and social 
  benefits of being American still too alluring. And besides, this present generation--Generation 
  X--had yet to be born. Despite what some think of it, and its seemingly present 
  lack of direction, it has the energy, the technical expertise, and the spiritual 
  wherewithal to change the world. All it has to do is rise up together, obey 
  God, and give an emphatic &quot;NO&quot; to the present system of things...see 
  Revelation 18). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The next to last page of this particular issue of <i>Muhammad 
  Speaks </i>cites Revelation 13:18, rightly applying the &quot;Number of the 
  Beast&quot; to the American system of things, saying: &quot;Behold, America, 
  you are in judgment.&quot; To fully comprehend and interpret this number, however 
  (to have access to its fullest meanings), requires more than just perceiving 
  the face of spiritual wickedness in the highest places of the American political 
  and religious order; it requires that one first enter into a fully heartfelt 
  relationship with God Themselves (with the Presence of Divine Wisdom who encoded 
  the number in the pages of the Scriptures to begin with--thus with those principles 
  and realities that connect the Mind of God to the mind of Man in our time). 
  One must not only be on this path to higher consciousness, as Paul said...</font></p>

    says Thomas, cutting to the quick. &quot;I choose to use the term 'racialist.'&quot; 
    National Socialism, as envisioned by Adolf Hitler, is a political companion 
    of Christian Identity...</p>
  <p>They flock to Thomas's bucolic lands to study Identity creed: that Aryans 
    are God's chosen people; that come Armageddon, God will order his white flock 
    to kill all non-Aryans in a U.S. based race war...</p>
  <p>Thomas's message...is a stew of ingredients taken from three major national 
    hate groups: Christian Identity, a mostly anti-Semitic faith that anoints 
    whites as master of all; the Idaho-based Aryan Nation, a skinhead-friendly 
    paramilitary operation, some of whose members have been linked <i>by cops 
    to racially motivated killings</i> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
    emphasis mine)</font>; and Posse Comitatus, a political movement that frames 
    the Founding Fathers' vision as a christian <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(read 
    white)</font> government in which the only authority is the local sheriff.</p>
  <p>The Bible is clear on what to do, Thomas says: &quot;The Christian obligation 
    to bear arms is found in Luke. We are to wrest control of the planet by any 
    means necessary.&quot;</p>
  <p>The event is set for the U.S.: &quot;There will be a race war,&quot; he says. 
    &quot;I'm committed at any cost to establishing a white Christian government 
    within the limitations of God's law. Does God's law allow under certain circumstances 
    the taking of human life? Sure.&quot;</p>
  <p>Self defense is one way. Armageddon is another. &quot;Kill a Jew? Kill a

<p><font size="+1">T</font><font size="+1">his Klansman, as spiritually sick and 
  afflicted as he is, reflects a broader spiritual reality. He represents another 
  sub-set of the American state of mind. The whole Aryan movement, in its own 
  extreme and isolated ways, reveals the underlying complex of spiritual and social 
  reasonings that drive the collective complex of the national psyche itself. 
  It is characterized by an obsession (a constitutional obsession) with guns, 
  and an intrigue with (para)military operations, with the idea of violence as 
  a solution to social and political problems, and a wholly ill-formed biblical 
  sense of the meaning of holy warfare and the ultimate Christian sacrifice. (<i>That 
  which dieth of itself, or is torn of dogs is not accepted</i>...Only that which 
  is called, <i>as was Aaron</i>, is acceptable). In other words, there is a strain 
  of this Aryan spirit in every American, whether they accept and recognize it 
  or not. For these are the values that are imparted to every American child every 
  day of their lives. The Arayans just take them to the extremes. It requires 
  the constant and selective vigilance of the Divine Spirit to overcome them.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> These values are imparted in a thousand interrelated ways 
  (at home, at church and school, and through the massive and supporting presence 
  of the American media), and they take hold because few step forward to say that 
  these ways are not only un-<i>Christian</i>, but that they are clearly signs 
  of spiritual insanity. (Those who do come forward to say so are, of course, 
  partitioned and vilified, as the Nation of Islam so otherwise rightly observed). 
  For what difference does it make to the Mind of the Universe if one group upholds 
  these values from a cabin door or mountain enclave in Idaho, while the larger 
  group upholds them from the frontsteps of its own national borders, or from 
  the doorsteps of the White House. Both commit the same things in the name of 
  the same God (but the government even moreso as the Waco/Oklahoma incident revealed. 
  It reaped what it sowed), the same God who, in the very same Scriptures as these 
  patriots read, commands the children of Light to transcend this state of mind 
  and to have nothing to do with any of these affairs at all. What the American 
  government is to the Aryan Brotherhood, however, all the other nations in the 
  world-at-large are to the American people and the American government. They 
  see the American nation in the same light as the American government sees the 
  Aryan Nation. Both are driven to their mutual states of behavior because in 
  the great scheme of creation the Mind of Christ is not fully formed in them 
  yet. There are vast undeveloped spaces there in their own minds that have not 
  been filled yet by either real spiritual experience or inspiration...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When we understand that Genesis 1:14-25 is not referring to 
  the material stars in the material heavens, or to the creation of animal life 
  on earth, but of Creation's descent of the into the human life-force--from the 
  heights of spiritual reality (the angelic realm), through all of the intellectual 
  and emotional levels of human consciousness (symbolized by the various animals 
  and other creatures of the earth), and finally to the creation of the spirit 
  of Adam (<i>man) </i>in the earth--then we can also see that these Aryans (and 
  all others who hold to a doctrine of racial or national superiority), are among 
  <i> the beasts getting from under the limbs of the World Tree, and the fowls 
  from his branches</i>. (Daniel 4:14). They are all revealing themselves in the 
  judgments of this age, as it is also written:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">One must be able to visualize with the mind's eye the constant 
  interchange between the Invisible Presence of God--the Transcendent One who 
  is clearly understood and revealed in the karmic flow of all natural and human 
  events--and the collective state of human consciousness itself, in order to 
  comprehend the meaning of the term <i>angel</i> and its use in the Hebrew scriptures. 
  One can visualize it on the Tree of Life. The Logos (the Word of God) is the 
  Highest Angel. The Logos is those forces and dimensions of the Living Universe 
  that reveal themselves to the intelligent mind in intelligent forms. This is 
  the same which revealed itself to the mind of the early Church in the composite 
  form of the Christ Mystery. To the later Kabbalists it was the Metatron, the 
  same angel who went before the children of Israel to show them the way that 
  they should go (Exodus 23:20-24; 24:10-13). To the Asvins, the earliest bearers 
  of this Light to the regions of India, it was originally revealed in the joint 
  personalities of Agni and Indra--but also in the sum of all the other gods and 
  goddesses (for what are these <i>gods</i> but personifications of the forces 
  of nature and the moral principles and ideas that inhabit the universe). Each 
  of these gods--angels when their powers are discovered to be directly associated 
  with the course of human history--reveal themselves in conjunction with the 
  overspreading, world-wide and universal dimensions of the Great Tree out of 
  which all of Creation appeared. (These are the powers and principalities, the 
  thrones and dominions--the <i>Elohim </i>that inhabit the natural world). One 
  does not have to go far into the stories and oral traditions, or through many 
  pages of the world's sacred texts to discover it. Thus back out of Egypt--back 
  up into the higher planes of the World Mystery--came Isis, Osiris, and Horus 
  in the figures of Mary, her Egypto-now-Jewish consort, and the Christ child--the 
  Sun of Righteousness. (Malachi 4:2)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As the Angel (the Mind of the Universe) descended (or as it 
  reascended out of the primal life-forms hundreds of thousands of years ago) 
  to assume the proportions and shape of human life, the human species took on 
  the angelic form, as it is written: <i>And He made the stars also.</i> (Genesis 
  1:16). These <i>stars</i> are the first order of humanity, as it is also written: 
  <i>When the morning stars sang together. </i>(Job 38:7). And though it is obvious 
  that these ancient <i>sons and daughters of God</i> came with multiple physical 
  (racial) characteristics (we will leave it to others to determine if the individual 
  races sprang from one proto-race with a genetic code triggered for all the diversity 
  that we now observe in the human family, or if each emerged from the womb of 
  Mother-Earth separately, and in different locations), it is also evident that 
  humanity, in its purely physical sense, is a single species, sharing the very 
  same genetic code. More importantly though, in Adam/Manu/Christ we are gathered 
  out of the realm of differences and transformed into a single Celestial Race, 
  possessed of a single spirit and a single soul. </font><font size="+1"> It is 
  at this point in history--about six thousand years ago--that the words began 
  to have their effect which say: <i>Let Us make man in Our image</i>:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(their

    their lowest inclinations and most subtle desires)</font><font size="+1">...(Genesis 
    1:26-31). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This new being (Adam), though of the earth themselves, was 
  able to look back into the whole realm of life from which (they themselves) 
  emerged to see the intricate and metaphysical connections that existed between 
  heaven and earth and the human spirit; and between the animal realm on earth 
  and the intellectual, emotional, and physical characteristics of the human spirit. 
  But more: this Adam was now capable of realizing that humanity itself was still 
  divided into several psychological levels or spheres of intelligence and behavior. 
  Some in the human family were fixed in their states of mind like the stars in 
  heaven. Through further observation (and from their own now-higher point of 
  view), they were able to see that some were more alike in their behavior to 
  the various kinds of fowls and flying creatures that dwelt in the earth (see 
  Genesis 15:11; Jer.7:33). And some were attended by a deeper emotional quality, 
  like the creatures that dwelt beneath the surface of the waters. And all, it 
  seemed, shared the qualities of the four-footed beasts that dwelt among them. 
  Some were strong and gentle, some noble, some swift of thought and foot, some 
  sluggish and slow. Some were wise, some cunning and crafty. Some were ravenous 
  and viscious, selfish and tyrannical. Some were hunters, some were not. Those 
  that were not were acceptable as a sacrifice upon God's altar. All of them, 
  however, the entire natural order, the gentle and the cruel alike, were ordained 
  by God for God's own creative purposes--for purposes that God has been explaining 
  to humankind through the shamans of the earth, and through the seers and the 
  prophets since the time of Adam. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This Adam/Manu, was now possessed of a gift from above, and 
  a mission to humanity. The gift was spiritual sight and inner reasoning (the 
  transcendent world was opened to their field of view). The mission, or ministry 
  if you will--in keeping with Adam's down-to-earth, and humble sense of their 
  own place in the center of the universe--was an understanding of also being 
  called to be priests of the Most High, prophets and teachers of the highest 
  philosophy, thus intermediaries between the Mind of God and the mind of humanity... 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In keeping with the emerging Tao of Wisdom and Understanding 
  (being able now to witness or envision the fierceness of God in the elements 
  of nature, as well as in the behavior of the other tribes and peoples of the 
  earth) Adam was ordained to teach and practice a form of active pacifism that 
  was first characterized in the figure of Abel, and which is brought to perfection 
  in the Mystery of Christ. This perfection would be completed at the same time 
  and in the same place as the Great Circle was complete, when all the children 
  of (this second) Adam returned once again to the meaning of the words: <i>Let 
  Us create man in Our image.</i> These words are only now having their fullest 
  effect. Thus we find ourselves with the ability to discover once again that 
  the angelic order--which still exists, and which still reveals itself on the 
  plain of human events--contains separate orders within itself, as Paul says: 
  <i>For one star differeth from another in glory </i>(1 Corinthians 15:41). It 
  includes all of those in our time who are to be heirs of salvation (the new 
  angelic order of Man), as well as all the terrible powers and principalities 
  of the East that God has reserved for Himself against the day of battle and 
  war:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">To make all men see what is the Fellowship of the Mystery, 
    which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all 
    things in Jesus Christ...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ephesians 3:9).</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">__________</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister 
    to them who shall be heirs of salvation?...</font></i><font size="+1">(Hebrews 
    1:14).</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">__________</p>

<p><font size="+1">Following the ordinances of Heaven one arrives at last not 
  only at the symbolic number of every soul who has come out of the East to the 
  Western ends of the earth in these times, but of every soul who has ever--throughout 
  the entire lifetime of the Holy Nation--found their lives in the Mystery of 
  Christ and the Tree of Life. <i>Ye are ALL my witnesses, saith the Lord. </i>(Isaiah 
  43:10; 44:8)... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus those who are coming to perfection can see how the Black 
  Angel was not released upon the world for judgment alone (solely as a force 
  for social instability and political retribution against the Western world, 
  or as a drain upon its energies and resources as some would have it), but it 
  has a been instead an indispensible minister of moral righteousness, and of 
  Christ-Consciousness to the Western world as well. For we will all agree again 
  that the Awakening that is occurring in America (as well as elsewhere), could 
  not have happened at all without the presence of the Black Angel--indeed, without 
  the slave and Jim Crow experience and the Civil Rights period that followed 
  it, and the strength and character of soul that flowed from it. These events 
  energized the antiwar movement that followed close afoot, and the entire counter-cultural 
  experience that emerged from it all. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There was definetly <i>A new wind blowing</i>. From the Highlanders 
  Community to the streets of every major city in the country went the words: 
  <i>We shall overcome, We are not afraid.</i> And what of the Indigenous Peoples 
  and American Indian Movements? These were a long time coming as well. And the 
  (real) environmental movement? (Blacks have hardly concerned themselves with 
  it yet). The whole of it was an explosive outflow of the creative and healing 
  energies of the Holy Spirit--a &quot;calling out&quot; and preparation for the 
  Birth that is still to come. The 50s and 60s, and the years that followed, were 
  an expression of Her own heart, the work of Her own hands. She was giving form 
  to the Child that will soon appear (Revelation 12:1,2), the Child that was forming 
  in secret, in the hearts of all who are being called to this wonderful event. 
  The music is Her's, the love of Life, the quest for simplicity, and even the 
  technology that shall soon be placed in the hands of those who can be trusted 
  with it. She has taught us to love one another with a degree of love that was 
  not possible before these times. The entire emerging spiritual order, and the 
  sense of universal wholeness, as well as the revelations in every field of study 
  that now attend it, are the fruit of Her labors. She has accompanied us, and 
  has been instructing us through the entire ordeal of these times, caring for 
  us in ways that only a Great Mother can. These things were just the beginning, 
  however, just the first stirrings, and shall hardly compare to the energies 
  that shall be released upon the earth once this Child is born. (It is only the 
  spirit of antichrist and the powers of the Western Corporate State that stand 
  in the way...<i>Ready to devour the Child as soon as it is born</i>). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So we must go further, and ask: Who could have come to this 
  present and collective state of mind without the participation of every other 
  (for evil as well as for good)? Likewise, If one is Black they must ask themself: 
  How could I have possibly come to my own present state of spiritual awareness 
  without the American experience? Without this personal experience with the spirit 
  of antichrist in the earth--a mantle that the white man has been made to wear? 
  And what of the Terrible judgment, the Divine Fire that is about to fall from 
  heaven on top of him, if he will not repent of his evil deeds?...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Indeed, how could any of us know anything at all of oppression, 
  injustice, the subtle nature of wickedness, spiritual rebellion, pride, vainglory, 
  the wayward quest for empire, and even of the many ways in which the Scriptures 
  can be misinterpreted and misused, or of how God will rise up against any future 
  attempts by man to recreate the world in his own image, unless God had showed 
  them to us, and if He had not also raised up a particular culture in the earth 
  to show it in? One that must also make an atonement for all of its great historic 
  transgressions...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And how else could those in the Black Community who hold a 
  racially exclusive view of themselves, learn of their own lack of knowledge 
  and understanding of divine matters, of their own inabilities to discover the 
  essence of the Word of God, of their own inabilities to express compassion and 
  love for others, especially for the lost white man, in the most excellent way 
  that Christ and so many others in our time have shown us...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And at the same time, how else could those members of the main-line 
  Baptist-African-American-Black and White liberal coalition learn of its own 
  transgressions, of its own (lethal) attachments to the ways of the world---to 
  the ways of Ba'al? The American Civil Rights Movement, while it was inciting 
  a spiritual revival in the human heart, and the mind of Christ in the remnant 
  of this generation, was also moving in ways that were opposite to the teachings 
  of Christ. In its own zeal to effect a measure of economic justice and righteousness 
  in the earth, in its own determination to (push through or break down the barriers 
  that God had set up between the blessed poor of the earth and the system of 
  things that oppressed them), it has also helped to lead God's children into 
  the great state of frustration, confusion and disorder everyone finds themself 
  in today. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Against God's commandment to <i>Come out from among them, and 
  be ye separate</i> (2 Corinthians 6:14-18), the Civil Rights Movement lost sight 
  of the end of things, and invested all of its rhetoric and its energies, pressing 
  in, trying to become an integral part of the American political and economic 
  order. With their eyes on a prize that will turn out in the end to be no prize 
  at all, the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement sought full and active participation 
  with the <i>Unfruitful works of Darkness. </i>In the process they allowed the 
  spirit of Darkness to co-opt and assimilate not only the language of equality 
  and justice, but the energies of the people themselves. How? By allowing the 
  sons of Darkness year after year, election by election, to work their worldly 
  charms in the life of the Church. By allowing the sons of Darkness to enter 
  the houses of worship, and in their quest for power to stand in the pulpits, 
  to join hands with the congregation, and to express God's words in worldly religious 
  ways that are clearly contrary to God's word itself. (We love the rhetoric and 
  the slogans, the intrigues of politics, but we have little taste for real solutions. 
  They can be dangerous)...</font></p>

  In light of the serious social and psychological conflicts that are aflicting 
  many young black men in our time, perhaps this from a young black man I met 
  several years ago who intrigues us with his theory on rap music and the hip-hop 
  movement in America. In the article he was writing he planned to relate this 
  phenomenon to the theme of the half-animated movie version of Joel Chandler's 
  <i>Song of the South. </i>The conflicts began in the South, he said, in the 
  relationship between the completely subjugated (but so much wiser) black male 
  and his Southern (but spiritually and intellectually inferior) white oppressors. 
  The young black male is personified in Brer Rabbit who hip-hops his way through 
  the story, but who must be ever on guard against the wiles and lesser mentalities 
  of Brer Bear and Brer Fox. In his attempts to keep them mollified and at a safe 
  distance from himself and his family, Brer Rabbit must constantly sacrifice 
  his sense of self in their presence, ever depleting his sense of his own manhood. 
  It tears at his soul to do so, but to confront them in any way at all is to 
  do so at the peril of one's life. The Civil Rights Movement and its ensuing 
  events freed up these pent up hostilities and emotions, particularly in Northern 
  cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee and Chicago and, 
  as the flame ignited, in Los Angeles and other places.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the film Brer Rabbit is caught and tied up by Brer Bear 
  and Fox, who now decide his fate. &quot;Please,&quot; Brer Rabbit pleads (drawing 
  on centuries of experience; he knows these two can be tricked), &quot;what ever 
  you do to me, please don't throw me in the (shudder) briar patch.&quot; A light 
  goes on above their heads, and sure enough they decide to throw Brer Rabbit 
  in the briar patch. This briar patch (this Crown of Thorns as it is), represents 
  the death and resurrection of the black man, the death of his old fearful regard 
  for the white man and his oppresive culture, and the resurrection of his own 
  true nature--his own Christlike nature (more divine, and closer to truth than 
  any southern white man could ever hope to be). Brer Rabbit appears on the far 
  side of the briar patch...hip-hop, hip-hop...with renewed courage, and with 
  a determination never to be caught and trapped by these two crackers again. 
  &quot;Don't you know,&quot; he chides them, &quot; that I was born in that briar 
  patch.&quot; &quot;It is my true nature to be free, to be my own man--my own 
  Divine Man.&quot; His thoughts will be his own now, not the white man's. His 
  lyrics will come from somewhere deep within himself, regardless of what others 
  think or say about them. And if there is any inherent evil in the black soul, 
  then the (young) black man (and the young black woman) will work it out on his 
  (their) own terms, and find it in himself (themselves) without being told how 
  to define that evil. &quot;We will descend into ourselves, work our way through 
  our own lower impulses and attain our own catharsis. And we will return to the 
  center on our own, when we (or God) decide, as true men and not slaves. Hip-hop, 
  hip-hop...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GOD FINALLY GIVES 
  SHOUT-OUT BACK TO HIS NIGGAZ</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>SOUTH BRONX, NY__The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades 
    of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday, when he gave a shout-back to 
    all His loyal niggaz.</p>
  <p>&quot;Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga 
    who's shown Me love through the years,&quot; said the Lord. His booming voice 
    descending from Heaven. &quot;I got mad love for each and every one of you 
    niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there 
    for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew....All 
    y'all niggaz be My niggaz,&quot; the Lord added.</p>
  <p>As of press time, God had thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those 
    in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryder posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash 
    Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. 
    Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back 
    in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs 
    to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other 
    new niggaz just coming up.</p>
  <p>&quot;Mad props to P. Diddy, Jay-Z, DMX, Lil' Kim, Mystikal, Eve, Ja Rule, 
    Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, 
    and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan,&quot; the deity said. 
    &quot;These My beloved niggaz, with whom I am well-pleased.&quot;...</p>
  <p>&quot;God is the Original,&quot; Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said. &quot;The 
    world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator 
    who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and the 
    righteous alike.&quot;</p>
  <p>Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing 
    fire in certain circles for His use of the word &quot;nigga.&quot; On Monday's 
    Larry King Live, conservative activist Rev. Calvin Butts, a longtime ally 
    of the Lord, blasted Him for His &quot;shocking, unexpected use of the racially 
    loaded N-word.&quot; Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. 
    Delores Tucker, Sen. Orin Hatch, and members of the San Francisco-based What 
    About The Children Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services 
    until God issues an apology. Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop 
    community are rushing to the Lord's defense.</p>
  <p>&quot;The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used 
    and whose saying it,&quot; rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. 
    &quot;Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was 
    using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on 
    the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock, 
    MC Serch, and My man Dan the Automator--all y'all is real niggaz in MY beloved 
    sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator 
    is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just 
    paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him.&quot;<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

  adolescence, who had to listen to those insufferable lyrics and interminable 
  rhythms for hours without end. You have to apologize for your duplicity in respect 
  to womankind, and for the phyical disrespect you have shown for sexuality. Those 
  of you who know better have to apologize to all of the impressionable young 
  minds you exploited, and who got into a lot of soul-trouble because of it. You 
  helped lay the foundation for a lot of dysfunction. (Of course, you might reason, 
  these kids were heading in that direction anyway...and that's true, but you're 
  partly responsible now). You can't out-thug the thugs, so overcome them with 
  weapons they can not match--with love and compassion. That Dream still lives 
  you know. And besides, there's a lot of planting and building to do and you 
  can't get it done with your pants hanging down around your rear ends...And loosen 
  up, get rid of that false persona, learn to laugh at yourselves a little. It's 
  good for the soul. Atone for your anger, your self-obsessions, your own greed, 
  and own up to your own violent ways. Quit shifting the blame. The true revolutionary 
  attacks themself first. We'll be waiting on ya. There's a foundation to repair,
