<p align="center">THE GOSPEL OF THE MARKETPLACE</p>
<p align="center">By Kenneth L. Woodward</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Eleven years ago, Michael Novak set out in &quot;The Spirit of Democratic 
    Capitalism&quot; to prove that capitalism &quot;rightly understood&quot; is 
    compatible with Roman Catholic social doctrine. This was no small achievement, 
    given the modern papacy's century-old suspicion of capitalism as the invention 
    of Protestant individualism...Never mind that by the 1980's Catholics were 
    as likely as Protestants to be heads of major corporations, or to vote for 
    Republicans. Mr. Novak's sin, if sin it be, was to bring a converts enthusiasm 
    to capitalism's entrepreneurial spirit, and to confer a lay theologian's blessings 
    on it. Worse, in his critic's eyes, he did all this from the sheltered confines 
    of the American Enterprise Institute, a not-for-profit Washington think tank 
    financed by captains of industry. </p>
  <p>In essence, Mr. Novak argued that democratic capitalism is morally superior 
    to socialism: that the triangular nexus of a market economy, a democratic 
    polity and a pluralistic culture not only produces a higher standard of living 
    but is also more consonant with Christian values than the command economies 
    and socialistic policies of Eastern Europe. What he wouldn't do was square 
    his conclusions with the received wisdom of his own religious tradition. Paul 
    VI...was no friend of American capitalism or of multinational corporations, 
    and John Paul II, at that point was advocating (with his Polish homeland very 
    much in mind) a modified form of socialism: workers sharing in the ownership 
    of productive means while state planners insure a just distribution of goods 
    and services. Rome, Mr. Novak concluded, still had much to learn from the 
    American experience in political economy.</p>
  <p>Socialism is now history in Eastern Europe, and John Paul II himself has 
    embraced market economics with an ardor that signals a new departure in papal 
    thought...</p>
  <p>In Mr. Novak's view, Catholic ethics brings two dowries to its betrothal 
    of capitalism: an appreciation for the &quot;social dimensions of the free 
    economy&quot; and rich understanding of human inventiveness and creativity, 
    which he celebrates as &quot;the spirit of capitalism.&quot;</p>
  <p>By the first, he means business and other voluntary associations that capitalism 
    necessarily brings into existence in order to produce goods, services, and 
    profits. In calling attention to these associations, Mr. Novak hopes to show 
    that capitalism is inherently social, not individualistic: that by nourishing 
    the developments of institutions and the personal virtues (of thrift, honesty 
    and practical wisdom) necessary to sustain them,capitalism enriches the social 
    and moral life of its constituents.</p>
  <p>By the second, Mr. Novak means that capitalism is fundamentally as much an 
    exercise in human creativity as are literature, science and the arts. Imagination, 
    it should be said, has long been a central concern in Mr. Novak's writings 
    on theology, philosophy, education, literature and sports. But now that John 
    Paul II has declared that all workers are called to be &quot;co-creators&quot; 
    with God, Mr. Novak is moved to declare that &quot;in fact, the true moral 
    strength of capitalism lies in its promotion of human creativity,&quot; and 
    that a democratic capitalist society, however imperfect, is &quot;perhaps 
    the most responsive to the social implications of the Gospels yet developed 
    by the human race.<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)</font><b>...</b></p>

    <p><i><font size="+1">I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called 
      you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Which is not another; but there be some that trouble 
      you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other 
      gospel unto you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed...</font></i><font size="+1">(Galatians 
      1:1-10). </font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">Think that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: 
      I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, 
      one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, 
      and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: 
      but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in 
      the kingdom of heaven...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew 5:17-19; 2 Corinthians 
      11:1-4, 13-15).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>...To be sure, Mr. Novak insists that the capitalist spirit must be chastened 
    by a culture informed by higher values. AND NOW THAT CAPITALISM IS THE ONLY 
    GAME IN TOWN, that might be his most important message. Certainly he is right 
    in declaring that the church has a special obligation to help insure private 
    enterprise in the emerging economies of Eastern Europe and in the submerged 
    economies of Latin America. But as he himself argues, capitalism is mother 
    of its own inventions; IN BIBLICAL LANGUAGE, ITS SPIRIT BLOWETH WHERE IT WILL. 
    In the past, the popes may indeed have been blind to capitalism's considerable 
    merits. But they did well to insist that this modern genie be tethered once 
    it is outside its bottle.</p>

  poverty?), but upon these do we bestow charity and provide welfare. (Indeed)? 
  Only those who qualify may participate in the economic order of things these 
  might reason to themselves. And another might reason that he only lends upon 
  interest <i>to strangers</i>, never to those who are his own kith and kin, or

<p><font size="+1">Why is usury strictly prohibited by God? Why is it in its essence, 
  evil? It is quite easy to understand in our time, under the structure of the 
  present world economy. All the money in use today (money as we generally understand 
  it), is lent into existence (at interest) by the central banks of the major 
  corporate and industrial nations--the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States, 
  The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. We are speaking here of 
  money, as money has come to be defined for us over time, for in reality the 
  money we use--whether it be cowrey shells or dollars--is, firstly, a way of 
  keeping an impersonal account of all of our transactions, but more importantly 
  a <i>substitution, </i>not for the things we buy and sell but for the labor 
  and the time it actually took to make a product or provide a service--a point 
  well worth noting, for those who actually perform work with their hands, or 
  render services to others, possess all the true wealth in the world. (When the 
  crises come, and they will come, we will not be able to eat money...think about 
  that...Zephaniah 1:14-18). So how did they, who do no actual work with their 
  own hands, get to be in charge of all the <i>money</i> in the world? Think about 
  that) The overall supply of money is regulated into the economy (according to 
  the shifting concerns of the central bankers) through the large commercial as 
  well as neighborhood banks with which we in turn do business. The banks in turn 
  support themselves through further investments in the economy (investments in 
  the labors of other human beings) and the charging of interest. When a borrower 
  goes to the bank for a loan, whether it be a government, a large corporation 
  or a private individual, it promises to pay back a sum of money greater than 
  the sum they borrowed. The wickedness begins at this point. Where will the borrower 
  get the money to pay the interest on the loan? This money does not exist anywhere 
  in the economy. It is not there. Only the total amount of the principle on all 
  loans exists in the economy, because that is all that was borrowed or lent into 
  existence. The amount of the interest-due is not to be found, anywhere. It was 
  never lent into the total supply of money upon which everybody in the economy 
  draws. So where does the borrower go to get this added money that they owe on 
  their loans if it doesn't exist--so that they may remain as members in good 
  standing in the economic system, so that they may continue to borrow in the 
  future? They must figure out how to shift more of the existing supply of money 
  in the economy in their own direction. They must, right along with the rich 
  and powerful who have made a cunning art of such manipulations (they like to 
  think it is a science), steal it from the existing supply of money. Between 
  them they must either inflate the cost of their products and services, or what 
  they believe is their own labors, which in either case favors the processes 
  operating from the top of the economy down, at the ongoing expense, however, 
  of those who dwell at the bottom of the economy and who actually do all the 
  work...</font></p>

  <p>So intimate is the tie between Washington and Wall Street that it is difficult 
    to decide to whom to assign major responsibility for the debasement and murdering 
    of the dollar, but that these two centers do bear major responsibility is 
    incontestable: Wall Street by printing insecurities and the Treasury Department 
    in Washington by printing dollars. Wall Street issues pseudo-securities and 
    the Treasury Department pseudo-money. Similar centers exist in the large industrial 
    nations of the world. England, with the appearance of the Industrial Revolution, 
    pioneered in pseudo-production. Japan is the latest present-day industrial 
    nation to join in the game of pseudo-production. No doubt others will arise 
    until the last of the free economies disappear, and the verdict of the Inquest 
    of History upon what Lincoln called &quot;the last great hope of mankind&quot; 
    will be death by monetary suicide...</p>
  <p>To make clear what I mean when I speak of Wall Street and Washington, it 
    is necessary to distinguish what they in theory are supposed to be and what 
    in fact they are.</p>
  <p>Wall Street, in theory, is the center of the financial system which provides...for 
    the capital needs of the nation. But Wall Street is in fact a speculation 
    (gambling) center organized and operated for the purpose of enabling a self-selected 
    minority of men and of boundless greed to become millionaires and billionaires. 
    Whatever Wall Street does to provide for the capital needs of the nation is 
    incidental to, and misshaped and distorted by, what in fact is.</p>
  <p>Washington, in theory, is the establishment which governs the nation for 
    the purpose of providing for the protection and for the welfare of the people 
    it governs. Washington in fact is an establishment misshaped and distorted 
    for the purpose of enabling men of boundless ambition to gratify their desire 
    to exercise power and to exploit it as long as they can. In theory the functions 
    which the two perform are entirely different. In practice, however, both the 
    men of greed and the men of power, have found that they can gratify their 
    desires far more effectively if they work together...<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Inflation,

<p><font size="+1">To participate in a capitalist economy, where the accumulation 
  of private wealth is the driving force, one must either wittingly or unwittingly 
  participate in the real (not theoretical), institutional oppression of other 
  human beings. In a capitalist economy in order for there to be wealth there 
  <i>must</i> be poverty. In a capitalist economy there must be massive environmental 
  destruction, for economic <i> GROWTH</i> is the force that sustains the great 
  Giant. Non-self-sustainable growth is what keeps those who are employed employed 
  and the whole house of cards from falling down. There must also be a massive 
  allocation of the general fund for military purposes, and quite necessarily 
  so for (finally, after six thousand years of human history, since the time of 
  Adam), the Lord of heaven and earth is preparing to rise up now against the 
  entire order of things. <i>And great was the fall of it...</i>(Matthew 7:21-27;

  <p>His distrust of the mayor is visceral, intense. &quot;I don't like him. I 
    don't like his ways. I don't like the way he speaks about poor people. I don't 
    like his eyes. I watch his eyes. There's too much coldness there.&quot; David, 
    New York City high schooler, to Jonathan Kozol, author of Amazing Grace.</p>
  <p>To those who read this who live in an American ghetto, &quot;el barrio,&quot; 
    nothing in <i>Amazing Grace</i> will surprise. To those who do not, and who 
    still think America is a just, fair society, it is possible that <i>Amazing 
    Grace</i> will strip one's soul.</p>
  <p>In New York City, the economic, cultural and media capital of the American 
    Empire, the pressing,perpetual oppression of the poor continues unabated...In 
    <i>Amazing Grace</i>, Jonathan Kozol listens to the tortured voices of those 
    at the economic bottom in the South Bronx, the grandmoms, the moms, those 
    with AIDS, and the children.</p>
  <p>The children...They are beautiful, and wonderfully bright, children who know 
    in their hearts that the rich and politically powerful would rather they were 
    never born. They think, before they are in their tenth year of life, of death, 
    of God, of justice, and of an ever present, gnawing hunger.</p>
  <p>They visit the city's glittering downtown, where fortunes are traded every 
    day, where they are treated as trash, and bristle. They pray to God with an 
    intensity only the very young could muster, and wonder why it seems God doesn't 
    hear.</p>
  <p>They hear the public, barely disguised expressions of official government 
    and class contempt, and wonder why they are so deeply and completely hated. 
  </p>
  <p>The voices of these young are at once, as beautiful as they are haunting. 
    They remind us that the young are perceptive, and acutely sensitive to their 
    environments. They see their mothers slandered and disrespected, their neighborhoods 
    made into corporate dumping grounds, their schools impoverished, and their 
    hopes diminished. They are the children of acute despair...</p>
  <p><i>Amazing Grace</i> will reap rivers of tears, sell untold copies, but in 
    the end will change nothing, for politicians are deaf to the cries of the 
    poor, and ignore the powerless.</p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">At the same time came the disciples (unto Jonathan and

  <p><i><font size="+1">And they called the children unto them, and sat in the 
    midst of them,</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted,

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The same spiritual precepts hold true with regard to the present 
  orgy of investing going on in the stock markets of the world at this time. It 
  is as if the mind of Western man (and America in particular), has finally reached 
  critical mass--the point of total corruption if you will. And if the words, 
  <i>For the love of money is the root of all evil, </i>has lost its meaning, 
  how could anyone be concerned with the other moral details of the investment 
  industry--with the fact that the stock market (the capital investment in industries, 
  corporations, and other business ventures), is another way the capitalist system 
  of things steals from the common man and the wage-laborer. It is a direct violation 
  of the words: <i>My son defraud not the poor of his living...</i>(Ecclesiasticus 
  4:1-9), and of the commandment against <i>taking increase</i>. (See Ezekiel 
  18:8). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Taking increase is a sin against humanity. It is, simply put, 
  the accumulation of private wealth (including dividends on investments and profits 
  from the sale of corporate stocks), on the labors of other individuals. It is 
  the act of enhancing one's own personal welfare at the expense of others. It 
  is the act of siphoning from the top--off of the ever-fluctuating cost of all 
  products and services--an agreed upon amount that neither the investor, or the 
  employer, earned with their own hands, or through their own direct labors, thereby 
  forcing and holding the wages of the laborer (those who actually perform the 
  work) down while increasing the wages and profit margins of those who sit in 
  offices above, or idly at home. It is theft. Dispense with the notion that the 
  employer had the &quot;idea,&quot; and the investor had the capital to finance 
  the idea, and are therefore entitled to their share. All ideas come from God, 
  and are channeled through the human mind for the common wealth of all--in accordance 
  with the Universal Laws of God. <i>Those to whom much is given, much </i>(more)<i> 
  is required. </i>Those with &quot;ideas&quot; are required by God to become 
  servants to the common good--not servants of self. They must, in the very interest 
  of their own souls, see that these ideas are used to serve everyone they touch, 
  equally and without prejudice. (Not me $15 and you $5, because I have a mansion 
  to pay for, and 3 cars, and a country home, and higher expectations...you know, 
  a greater stake in the American dream. But rather, after all expenses are considered, 
  me $10 and you $10, regardless of position or intellectual capacity). (Actually, 
  if there is to be a currency in the coming order it will be based on &quot;time,&quot; 
  (someone suggested Sunlight), the only commodity in the universe that is equally 
  proportioned to every being. Work an hour, earn an hour. But this is another 
  chapter)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; has become the concept. 
  There are none more guilty of stealing it (from God) than the capitalist class, 
  and now they are caught. As for those who had the initial capital to invest 
  in these ideas (giving rise in time to the investment industry and the stock 
  markets that literally rule over us today)...Where did they acquire it? And 
  how? All of these fortune-holders started out as gun-slingers and henchmen for 
  the original strong man--Nimrod. And the subsequent means and methods of acquiring 
  power and wealth have been passed on ever since. Actually it goes back to the 
  time before Nimrod, to Cain, the archetypal child of Darkness:</font></p>

    <p align="center">MARKETS, LOGIC, AND DESIRE</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The theorists of emerging capitalist society, from Thomas Hobbes to 
    Adam Smith, imagined that selfishness, competition, bargaining, and private 
    ownership were eternal traits of human nature, characteristic of all of human 
    history...But it was probably the experience of the industrial revolution 
    in the nineteenth century that made European thinkers generally aware of the 
    importance of human change--especially economic change. The nineteenth century 
    was the golden age of historical study, the age of the study of evolution 
    and origins, and the first age to suggest that human nature might have changed 
    from one age to the next. The world of Darwin and Marx and anthropology could 
    no longer imagine that the inclinations or institutions of capitalist society 
    had existed for all time.</p>
  <p>Defenders of the new economy--groups like the English Manchester liberals 
    and utilitarians who spoke for the middle class of merchants and manufacturers--developed 
    a new assumption of the naturalness of capitalist ideas and behavior which 
    was more consistent with the historical consciousness of their age. They reasoned 
    in effect that although capitalism had not always existed, the instinctual 
    need and logic of capitalism had always existed, and that history was the 
    development of that desire and logic. Their ideas were so influential that 
    they have become almost the &quot;common sense&quot; of twentieth-century 
    Americans. They imagined that primitive trading had merely become more complex 
    over the years, that people gradually found it easier to attach price tags 
    (or money values) to the things they bartered, and that local trade led to 
    national and finally to international trade as the new knowledge of marketing 
    techniques grew. In effect, these defenders of the new system were arguing 
    that if capitalism had not always existed at least a natural inclination to 
    barter had become more sophisticated. In many ways this was yet another version 
    of human nature<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)...</font></p>

  <p>...Many of us still today assume that capitalism developed logically from 
    the inside out, from the simple to the complex, from the local to the foreign, 
    and from the small scale to the world scale. We assume for instance that barter 
    exchanges among friends led gradually to more efficient exchanges of money, 
    that local trade became more monetized as it became more complex, that such 
    capitalist institutions as money, markets, prices, profits, and private property 
    expanded from village to city to state to world as they proved their superiority 
    over simpler ways...</p>
  <p>Actually, however, nothing is further from the truth. One of the most amazing 
    things about the history of capitalism is that most people fought every step 
    of its expansion. The clergyman, the artisan, the farmer, the villager, the 
    worker, the landlord, the tenant, and even many of the slowly emerging middle 
    class fought the expansion of capitalism, because it seemed to come from outside

  <p>Our epoch, the epoch of (Capitalism), possesses however, this distinctive 
    feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more 
    and more splitting up into Two great hostile camps, into Two great classes 
    directly facing each other: Bourgeoise and Proletariat. Owners and wage laborers 
    who have no means of production themselves and who are, thus, forced, or reduced, 
    to selling their labor in order to live.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The (capitalist-industrial class) whenever it has got the upper hand, 
    has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relationships. It has pitilessly 
    torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his 'natural superiors,' 
    (This is not necessarily bad...the Communists didn't understand the dialectic 
    process either), and has left no other nexus between man and man than naked 
    self-interest, and callous cash payment.&quot; (This was bad). </p>
  <p>&quot;They have stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and 
    looked upon with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, 
    the priest, the poet, and the man of science into its paid wage-laborers.&quot; 
    (As far as it happened this was bad. It was also necessary). (p.82). </p>
  <p>&quot;It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the capitalistic 
    mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization 
    into their midst (remember the scene in Pocahontas)? i.e., to become capitalist--or 
    bourgeois--themselves. In one word, It creates a world after its own image.&quot; 
    (P.84).</p>
  <p>&quot;Capitalist society...has conjured up such a gigantic means of production 
    and exchange that it is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control 
    the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.&quot; 
    (p.85).</p>
  <p>&quot;It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical 
    return put on trial, each time more threateningly, the existence of the entire 
    bourgeois society...</p>
  <p>And how does the bourgeoise get over these crises? On the one hand by enforced 
    destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other by the conquest of 
    new markets; and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is 
    to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, 
    and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented...(until, at last, 
    the means are exhausted and dictatorship ensues)...</p>
  <p>The weapons with which the bourgeoise felled feudalism to the ground are 
    now turned against the bourgeoise themselves...Not only have they forged the 
    weapons that bring death to themselves, they have also called into existence 
    those who will wield those weapons--the modern working class--the proletarians.&quot;<b>

    said that the 1991 coup marked the end of &quot;Stalinist socialism&quot; 
    but not of true socialism. True socialism, he said, is &quot;tied to the concepts 
    of social justice, freedom, equality, the general framework of human values. 
    In short: we promote the cause of Christ. The search for truth, humanity, 
    justice and spirituality are eternal values,&quot; he said...</p>

    and that if he thought the pope played a role in the crumbling of Communist 
    regimes in Eastern Europe.</p>
  <p>&quot;I can only add that which I concluded after having read the Pope's 
    encyclicals, after coming to know his sense of priestly mission, his appeals 
    for peace and harmony in defense of freedom.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev said. &quot;I

    they will. We do, most of the time, what is in our own selfish best interest.</p>
  <p>In a true Communist society (not that there has ever been one, but this is

    <p align="center">THE NATIONAL PSYCHE IN POST-REAGAN AMERICA</p>
    <p align="center">A Letter to the Editor</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Archibald L. Gillies (&quot;Start Planning for Post-Reagan America,&quot; 
    Op-Ed, March 5) talks about the work to be done in post-Reagan America. It 
    will indeed be hard work, particularly in one area that Mr. Gillies didn't 
    emphasize: our national psyche.</p>
  <p>President Reagan and his administration have fostered an unbridled free-enterprise 
    system and a might-makes-right foreign policy that is no more or less than 
    social Darwinism, a basic survival-of-the-fittest mentality. Domestically, 
    those who are poor or disabled must work or perish (be damned as the Puritans 
    of the 1500s believed), this although many, even before Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
    knew that capitalism in its purest form would leave as a byproduct a predictable 
    number of unemployed. In world relations, righteousness and leadership come 
    first from the demonstrable ability to destroy anyone and everyone who doesn't 
    capitulate to our dogmatic view of life on earth.</p>
  <p>Freud discussed the innate struggle in humans between instinctual aggressive 
    drives and the higher social need to be civilized in a book early in this 
    century called <i>Civilization and Its Discontents.</i> Ronald Reagan is a 
    very popular President because he inspires us not to suppress our greed or 
    our wish to dominate others, and indeed glorifies these instincts as the road 
    to security and prosperity...Perhaps post-Reagan America will look back at 
    these years as a last reactionary effort to resist being truly civilized.<b>

  sacrificing the Socialist ideal...Read his <i>Perestroika, New Thinking for

  brought the modern Communist state into existence were not aware of the true

  dialectic process. In the struggle between the two great materialistic world-systems

  <p>It's Thursday and all of America, it seems, is getting ready to watch <i>Who 
    Wants to Be a Millionaire</i>. The show is so popular that it receives about 
    240,000 phone calls a day from would-be contestants...</p>
  <p>Open a newspaper just about any day, and you'll read about day traders moving 
    into monster homes in gated communities and dot-com wizards becoming billionaires 
    before their companies turn a penny profit.</p>
  <p>The current prosperity has also been good to many Americans lower down on 
    the ladder, especially in the near full-employment conditions of the past 
    three years. (At how much an hour)? By many measures, the nation's material 
    well-being is astonishing. Since 1970, average living space has nearly doubled 
    in size to more than 800 square feet per person; the number of households 
    with two or more vehicles has climbed from 29 percent to 62 percent; air travel 
    has quadrupled.</p>
  <p>Last week, the Council of Economic Advisors reported sharply rising incomes 
    from 1993 to 1998 for those in the bottom 20 percent of the earnings scale. 
    With the incomes of the poorest fifth of America rising slightly faster than 
    than those of the richest fifth, the gap between rich and poor has actually 
    narrowed slightly for the first time since the 1970s. (Let's see now: 20% 
    of $5.15, or even $10 an hour, and, say, 15% of $100,000 is how much)?</p>
  <p>Still, over the last two decades, by far the greatest gains have gone to 
    those at or near the top. Outside of the &quot;new economy,&quot; many Americans 
    with plain old jobs--factory workers, fire fighters, telephone company managers, 
    secretaries--feel, somehow, out of it...</p>
  <p>The gap in wealth and income, some economists say, is a problem that will 
    eventually take care of itself. Better, at any rate to trust the marketplace, 
    they say, than risk hamfisted government attempts at redistribution...</p>
  <p>To many people, however, the gap between the very rich and everyone else 
    is very troubling. The country's social and political fabric could be damaged, 
    they fear...if resentment builds, and if the have-nots increasingly shun the

    happened yet.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IT is a &quot;financial disruption.&quot; 
    IT is an irreversible downward spiral that takes everything down with it. 
    IT will be started by a catalyst, a spark that will get everybody's attention. 
    But IT is already built into the economy prior to the spark, like a bunch 
    of oil rags waiting for a match. Some of the candidates for the catalyst include:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Crash of the Dollar...Stock Market

    lead to market decline/crash. (In case you haven't noticed, the Dollar has 
    been declining for more of the year...With the ECB announcement, it appears

<p align="center">The Protocols -- A NeoCon Manifesto<br>
  By Simon Jones <br>
  Dissident Voice<br>
  8-23-03</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I have to confess. The outrageous in-your-face behavior of the neocons finally 
    got to me - as Armageddon approaches, after seeing more and more references 
    to it (albeit usually wacky), I recently downloaded the Protocols of the Elders 
    of Zion. Guiltily, mind you, as if it were Mein Kampf or porno. I bet you 
    haven't dared (or bothered) to read it.</p>
  <p>So, what is this best-selling political tract of the 20th century, the reading 
    of which carried the death penalty in Stalinist Russia, lauded by the likes 
    of Henry Ford and Winston Churchill, and then loudly condemned for the past 
    60 years since it was briefly declared an anti-Semitic forgery (in a Swiss 
    court in 1935 overturned by the Appeals Court in 1937)?</p>
  <p>The bile aside, it is in fact an series of 24 mostly articulate, well-argued 
    lectures outlining a plan for world capitalist domination, with sharp political 
    and social analysis, lots of Machiavelli and a Marxian sophistication in its 
    understanding of capitalism and historical processes. Briefly, it outlines 
    a plan of world conquest by first establishing world government by consent. 
    As with any brilliant political analysis, it has been denounced, dismissed, 
    misinterpreted and banned. And made very good use of by those lusting for 
    world power.</p>
  <p>What immediately struck me was that with a little dusting off, abridging 
    and updating, it could easily be the handbook of the neocons. With the wonders 
    of modern computers, you can download a free copy from the Internet, cleanse 
    it of anti-Semitism by replacing &quot;fellow Jews&quot; with &quot;neocons&quot; 
    and make sense of what's happening in the world today.</p>
  <p>Mysterious origins? Not really</p>
  <p>Though its origins are still unknown, it was clearly inspired by the French 
    revolution and its aftermath, the then-popular Masonic order, and most of 
    all the nascent 19th century Zionist movement. All that we know is that it 
    was written in France and brought to Russia, supposedly in 1884. It first 
    appeared in print in St Petersburg in 1903, but reached the West only after 
    the Russian revolution. It caused an immediate sensation, originally crudely 
    interpreted as foretelling the Bolshevik revolution as the crucial link in 
    a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. As such, it was admired by the likes 
    of Churchill and Ford, both confirmed anti-communists and anti-Semites.</p>
  <p>True, it has the prescience to allow for an anti-capitalist revolution on 
    the way to its final goal, but there's nothing even vaguely socialist in it. 
    It's firmly founded on a plan for capitalist domination through Jewish control 
    of international finance and just happened to appear at the very moment of 
    the founding of the Zionist movement, with its goal of establishing as soon 
    as possible a Jewish state in Palestine, backed by powerful worldwide Ashkenazy 
    Jewish economic interests.</p>
  <p>It's as if an especially ruthless and well-read 19th c Zionist, inspired 
    by the Rothschilds and other great Jewish financiers of the time, wrote it 
    or most of it, as I am sure is the case. Really, it reads as if it were written 
    by the Jungian shadow of the likes of Zionism's founder, Theodore Herzl, or 
    any of Israel's notables from Ben Gurion to Ariel Sharon. Its anti-goyim callousness 
    certainly indicate it was not written for public consumption, and after Hitler, 
    it was relegated to the Forbidden Shelf in ALL libraries along with Mein Kampf 
    and naked bottoms. But it is very hard to believe that it is a spoof or a 
    mere provocation, as it is just too impressive in detail and understanding 
    of the logic of late 19th c capitalism.</p>
  <p>Did Hitler read it? I bet the Nazis read it carefully. They certainly followed 
    much of its advice, from how to use the press, to how to manipulate both politicians 
    and the masses in consolidating their political hold. It's also clear why 
    destruction of the Jews became Hitler's tragic obsession. His New World Order 
    (NWO) would have to exclude a group even remotely connected with such a scheme 
    for world domination. As the neocons warn today: &quot;You are either with 
    us or against us.&quot;</p>
  <p>Many paths - but they all lead to Rome<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(That 
    would be America. Just as America is modern Egypt, as well as modern Assyria, 
    so is it the culmination of all Seven World Empires that have risen up, one 
    after another in the West. Understand Revelation 17)</font><b>.</b></p>
  <p>The trouble with the Protocols is that it has been interpreted since it was 
    published to suit the prejudices of the moment. In pre-revolutionary Russia, 
    it provided fuel for the already widespread Russian anti-Semitism. In post-WWI 
    Europe and America, it provided fuel against the Russian revolution. In the 
    post-WWII world, it became the Bible of American isolationists and racists 
    who see the poor UN as the dreaded &quot;World Government,&quot; backed by 
    the Soviet Union and 3rd world revolutions. Now it is read by Muslims as proof 
    of the conspiracy by US imperialism to destroy them.</p>
  <p>Another problem is that there have been many variations on the theme of the 
    NWO ever since the collapse of the Roman Empire. The French revolution and 
    Napoleonic conquests, the Masonic lodges, imperial Germany and England all 
    have had their own NWO fantasy. The Russian revolution was the most radical 
    attempt at a NWO, and even can be distinguished for the large number of Jews 
    who took part, but despite the fact that the Protocols was first published 
    in Russia and strictly banned during the Soviet period, the Soviet experiment 
    was not even remotely the final World Government of the Protocols, as it was 
    anti-capitalist in its essence.</p>
  <p>The red herring in it is of course 'Jewish', which is supposed to refer to 
    a race. The Jews referred to in the Protocols are the European Ashkenazy Jews, 
    who had been traditionally usurers and who were in the 19th century becoming 
    increasing wealthy and part of the mainstream European culture. From them 
    sprang the Zionists, who transformed a religion where God is to bring them 
    to the 'promised land' someday into an active plan to seize Palestine based 
    on their growing international economic and financial might. So it is this 
    group that is the real inspiration behind the Protocols and not some amorphous 
    Jewish RACE. Think of the authors as the neocons of the day. For by the 19th 
    century, usury was the norm, and the rapid spread of capitalism meant that 
    the Western world effectively became Jewish, as Marx put it, and adopted the 
    Jewish idea of success.</p>
  <p>Yet another problem. It is loudly dismissed as a forgery. Hello? It was anonymous, 
    so how can it be a forgery. Who forged what? No wonder the Swiss Appeals Court 
    threw the case out. In that case we can dismiss the Bible as a forgery. And 
    who cares who wrote the Psalms anyway? They stand on their own merits, as 
    does the Protocols stripped of a few provocative phrases here and there, which 
    could have been slipped in by anyone.</p>
  <p>You may well protest: &quot;The Protocols attributes the conscious machinations 
    of Jews to be behind all historical developments. I don't believe the Zionists 
    are either so powerful, or so far-sighted.&quot; In answer: It's not necessary 
    for our actions to be premeditated. The logic of world capitalism sweeps us 
    along, whether we like it or not. Some players are more conscious (and ruthless) 
    than others. They become the Herzls, the Wolfowitzes, the Sharons. The rest 
    of us get swept along, either yielding to, or fighting the current: the Bushes 
    and the Schwartzeneggers or the goyim. The Protocols (or its original, if 
    it is indeed a forgery) was inspired by the new economic system sweeping the 
    world, and composed by the 19th century equivalent of the neocons. It hasn't 
    played itself out yet, just as capitalism hasn't played itself out. We ignore 
    it at our peril.</p>
  <p>Arise, ye prisoners of starvation?</p>
  <p>Contrast the Zionist movement with the other great attempt at a NWO from 
    the 19th century on -- the world socialist movement. It is far weaker, split 
    by nationalism and hundreds of ideological splinters, and motivated by social 
    justice, a far less competitive motivation that money, wealth and power-for-its-own-sake. 
    The Protocols is quite clear about this: &quot;Our triumph has been rendered 
    easier by the fact that in our relations with the men whom we wanted we have 
    always worked upon the most sensitive chords of the human mind, upon the cash 
    account, upon the cupidity, upon the insatiability for material needs of man: 
    and each one of these human weaknesses, taken alone, is sufficient to paralyze 
    initiative, for it hands over the will of men to the disposition of him who 
    has bought their activities.&quot; (I)</p>
  <p>There is no fear of the dangerous effective of democracy: &quot;The abstraction 
    of freedom has enabled us to persuade the mob in all countries that their 
    government is nothing but the steward of the people who are the owners of 
    the country, and that the steward may be replaced like a worn-out glove. It 
    is this possibility of replacing the representatives of the people which has 
    placed them at our disposal, and, as it were, given us the power of appointment.&quot; 
    (I)</p>
  <p>Socialism never had a chance against this corrosive Machiavellianism, though, 
    just in case, the Protocols had a plan: &quot;The hour strikes when, not for 
    the sake of attaining the good, not even to win wealth, but solely out of 
    hatred towards the privileged, the lower classes of the goyim will follow 
    our lead against our rivals for power, the intellectuals of the goyim.&quot; 
    (IV) This is the only reference to the use of a revolt of the masses, which 
    was seized upon to associate the Protocols with the Russian revolution. Rather 
    slim pickings, and it reveals the strategy is to undermine the &quot;intellectuals 
    of the goyim&quot;, i.e., the socialist opposition to world capitalism.</p>
  <p>On the contrary, the Russian revolution seemed to really shake the very foundations 
    of the plan for world capitalist domination. Curiously in its first 30 years 
    the SU had the Zionists split. Why? Well, no doubt partly because many rank-and-file 
    Zionists were socialist by persuasion, truly wanted the SU to succeed and 
    hoped for a socialist Israel as a bonus (Herzl's utopian novel depicts a socialist 
    Israel). But for the Zionist fanatics of the Protocols, their fence-sitting 
    was because achieving their own state was the main priority, and required 
    the support of both the communist and capitalist camps.</p>
  <p>And as for the softer versions of socialism which have surfaced occasionally 
    in the West, their headway has always been kept well in check, and social 
    democratic reforms were rolled back very easily after the collapse of the 
    SU, via the tactics envisaged in the Protocols. So the plan of the Protocols 
    should not be confused with the many variations on a socialist/ communist 
    NWO.</p>
  <p>If you can't beat 'em, join 'em</p>
  <p>The Protocols also lauds &quot;the successes we arranged for Darwinism, Marxism, 
    Nietzscheism.&quot; (II) Why promote such radicals? Because of the &quot;disintegrating 
    importance these directives have had upon the minds of the goyim.&quot; Just 
    how central to Marx's success these Zionists were is debatable.</p>
  <p>But it's become clear to me that Zionists have penetrated and tried to control 
    all the NWO fantasies, from left to right, to further their own cause. It 
    is not surprise then that they have been at the center of the present neocon 
    insurgency from the start. And as for the EU-as-NWO, Sharon even suggested 
    Israel should join the EU since 'we share common ideals'. In spite of Israel's 
    loathing for the UN, it is at the very heart of THAT beleaguered, clumsy organization 
    too (with a stake in hand just in case, it can be argued). It has recently 
    been revealed that Zionists are even involved with extreme right anti-Semitic 
    movements in Europe and with the creation of Hamas. After all, anti-Semitism 
    is the Zionist's best defense. &quot;The Jewish group has thrived on oppression 
    and on the antagonism it has forever met in the world.&quot;<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Albert 
    Einstein, Collier's Magazine, November 26, 1938)</font></p>
  <p>True, anti-Semitism got out of control under Hitler and it even looked like 
    it was touch-and-go for a while for the Ashkenazy Jews of Europe, but fascism 
    was in turn destroyed by a capitalist-communist alliance, with Zionists at 
    its heart, as the Protocols so brilliantly foretold: &quot;For a time perhaps 
    we might be successfully dealt with by a coalition of the goyim of all the 
    world: but from this danger we are secured by the discord existing among them 
    whose roots are so deeply seated that they can never now be plucked up.&quot; 
    (VI) Divide and rule!</p>
  <p>The Holocaust gave the fanatical Zionists their long-sought state, which 
    allowed them to discard any socialist pretensions and nurture the capitalist-Zionist 
    alliance essential to the goal of world domination. The defining moment is 
    perhaps the triumph of the neocons under Reagan in the 1980s. The Zionists 
    had consolidated their hold on American foreign policy under Democrat Carter, 
    and were ready to make the alliance official under Republican Reagan. It is 
    at this point that the very term Zionist and even Jew can be discarded. As 
    I have argued elsewhere, 'We are all Jews now.' (http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Articles4/Jones_Palestine.htm) 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>And with the Bush coup in 2000, we all (for the present at least) have become 
    neocons (or goyim). As the opposition grows weaker, with the shield of the 
    Holocaust at the ready, the neocon-Zionist alliance has begun to act more 
    and more brazenly to consolidate its hold on the world and destroy the last 
    meaningful resistance - the Islamic world.</p>
  <p>The ultimate trump card</p>
  <p>Not only was the Holocaust and the way to defeat it foreseen in the Protocols, 
    but, like the anti-Semitism that gave rise to it, it has been turned into 
    the ultimate defense of the Zionist cause. A kind of perverse win-win situation 
    for the Zionists.</p>
  <p>It transformed important anti-Semites into Judeophiles overnight. While Churchill 
    was an enthusiastic reader of the Protocols before WWII, he became an enthusiastic 
    supporter of the foundation of Israel after, and shifted his anti-Semitism 
    onto the Arabs. Stalin, also a confirmed anti-Semite, provided the key vote 
    at the UN to approve the foundation of Israel and supplied crucial arms via 
    Czechoslovakia to the beleaguered state, foolishly thinking he could ultimately 
    manipulate. Ha, ha! Finally it became the linchpin in consolidating today's 
    neocon-Zionist alliance, and a brilliant defense for all manner of Zionist 
    crimes: &quot;We can do anything to defend ourselves after the Holocaust!&quot;</p>
  <p>The icing on the cake is the impressive Holocaust museum which blends in 
    tastefully with the Lincoln and Washington memorials in the heart of Washington, 
    D.C. (Note: There is no museum to the Holocaust against the native peoples 
    or the blacks.)</p>
  <p>A crack in the wall?</p>
  <p>While 'Old Europe' has made some noises about this lethal NWO, the governments 
    are nonetheless beholden to it, and can do little but try to carve a slightly 
    bigger piece of the pie. No, the only meaningful remaining resistance to the 
    neocon-Zionist NWO is the as yet unbrainwashed goyim of the world - the peace 
    movement and the Islamic world, strange bedfellows at best.</p>
  <p>However, there are some disturbing ripples in the NWO waters. Bush/ Sharon 
    have chosen the warpath, while the Soros branch, which includes Europe, wants 
    a more peaceful transition. The reckless policies of the erstwhile &quot;servile 
    administrator&quot; in Washington are quite possibly endangering the very 
    economic foundation of the NWO. The Protocols foresees such chaos, though 
    it presumes to be in control of it: &quot;We shall soon begin to establish 
    huge monopolies, reservoirs of colossal riches, upon which even large fortunes 
    of the GOYIM will depend to such an extent that they will go to the bottom 
    together with the credit of the States on the day after the political smash....&quot; 
    (VI)</p>
  <p>Such a collapse of the present world financial system is not at all beyond 
    the realm of possibility. And if it comes, it could take down the US government 
    and the neocons with it. It is here that the PROTOCOLS begins to unravel. 
    The Protocols assumes the corporate financial cabal controlling the world 
    economy will be invited to take over bankrupt governments with their World 
    Government, as indeed has been happening under the guise of IMF restructuring 
    programs and more recently by direct invasion. But the bankrupt and invaded 
    countries, such as Argentina, most of Africa, Afghanistan, Iraq for starters 
    are proving to be problematic, more than the cabal can digest.</p>
  <p>Maybe, just maybe, the neocons' gamble will trip them up before they reach 
    the finish line and they will end up along side the despised GOYIM at the 
    bottom. A switch to a gold dinar in the Muslim world and oil-euros for the 
    rest would seriously endanger the NWO, as would a massive ecological disaster, 
    natural or man-made.</p>
  <p>The mild neocons (Soros etal) see this clearly and are scurrying to minimize 
    collateral damage. Theirs is a strategy closer to the spirit of the Protocols 
    - no overt wars, a careful amassing of power through education and the control 
    of the press, no dangerous splits in the capitalist-Zionist alliance, achieving 
    victory through financial and trade blackmail. Have a look at the Protocols 
    yourself. It's all there.</p>
  <p>So, are these cowboy jackboot high jinks a momentary glitch in the triumphal 
    march to the neocon-Zionist paradise? Will a Howard Dean, urged on by Soros, 
    put the out-of-control steamroller back on its proper path? Or has the Protocols 
    played itself out? Is our present apocalyptic scenario instead a crack that 
    gives us hope of emerging from this nightmarish plot?</p>
  <p>Rational racism?</p>
  <p>I don't know about the Elders, the Symbolic Snake, the actual killing off 
    of the goyim, whether the line of King David will be re-established to rule 
    the world, the importance of the Masons, or whether the French Revolution 
    &quot;was wholly the work of our hands&quot;. There's surprisingly little 
    of such bile for a work of such notoriety, and it can be easily edited out 
    so as not to distract from the sharp analysis. Perhaps it was added by an 
    anti-Semite as a provocation. Who knows? As for the Masons, come to think 
    of it, the popularity of them, the Yale Skull and Bones, and other such Monty-Pythonesque 
    groups shows a stubborn inclination by would-be GOYIM leaders to voluntarily 
    (i.e., consciously or unconsciously) make themselves part of a world conspiracy, 
    however idiotic.</p>
  <p>That's not so much the problem. The major flaw behind the logic of the Protocols 
    is its basic premise - that there is a Jewish race. There is only one race 
    - the human race. Just have a look at Israeli society if you think there is 
    a racial basis to Judaism. But hey! Scientists are discovering that there 
    are genes which are responsible for skin color, that define risk-takers or 
    those susceptible to various diseases Maybe there's a gene for these would-be 
    Elders of Zion. Perhaps the NY Times will post the following soon: The Zionist-neocons 
    now welcome to their fold those who share their lust for capitalist world 
    domination. All those with gene DN145, please sign up here. We are all equal 
    before Mammon. MBA schools will go crazy.</p>
  <p>The Masonic lodges, Skull and Bones fraternities, the Jewish 'race' itself 
    are just foils in this march of world capitalism, gathering in like-minded 
    wanabes as it makes its final push for total control. It is somehow fitting 
    that the once reviled Jew should sit one day on the world's golden throne 
    surrounded by his neocon minions. That is the Protocols' vision of the end 
    of history. Eat your heart out Fukuyama!</p>

<p align="center">THE CORPORATION.COM</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, the corporation was a relatively insignificant 
  entity. Today, it is a vivid, dramatic and pervasive presence in all our lives. 
  Like the Church, the Monarchy and the Communist Party in other times and places, 
  the corporation is today&#146;s dominant institution. But history humbles dominant 
  institutions. All have been crushed, belittled or absorbed into some new order. 
  The corporation is unlikely to be the first to defy history. In this complex 
  and highly entertaining documentary, Mark Achbar, co-director of the influential 
  and inventive MANUFACTURING CONSENT: NOAM CHOMSKY AND THE MEDIA, teams up with 
  co-director Jennifer Abbott and writer Joel Bakan to examine the far-reaching 
  repercussions of the corporation&#146;s increasing preeminence. Based on Bakan&#146;s 
  book <i>The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power</i>, the 
  film is a timely, critical inquiry that invites CEOs, whistle-blowers, brokers, 
  gurus, spies, players, pawns and pundits on a graphic and engaging quest to 
  reveal the corporation&#146;s inner workings, curious history, controversial 
  impacts and possible futures. Featuring illuminating interviews with Noam Chomsky, 
  Michael Moore, Howard Zinn and many others, THE CORPORATION charts the spectacular 
  rise of an institution aimed at achieving specific economic goals as it also 
  recounts victories against this apparently invincible force.</p>
<p> THE CORPORATION: Among the 40 interview subjects are CEOs and top-level executives 
  from a range of industries: oil, pharmaceutical, computer, tire, manufacturing, 
  public relations, branding, advertising and undercover marketing; in addition, 
  a Nobel-prize winning economist, the first management guru, a corporate spy, 
  and a range of academics, critics, historians and thinkers are interviewed. 
</p>
<p>A LEGAL &#147;PERSON&quot;: In the mid-1800s the corporation emerged as a legal 
  &#147;person.&#147; Imbued with a &#147;personality&#147; of pure self-interest, 
  the next 100 years saw the corporation&#146;s rise to dominance. The corporation 
  created unprecedented wealth. But at what cost? The remorseless rationale of 
  &#147;externalities&#148;&#151;as Milton Friedman explains: the unintended consequences 
  of a transaction between two parties on a third&#151;is responsible for countless 
  cases of illness, death, poverty, pollution, exploitation and lies. </p>
<p>THE PATHOLOGY OF COMMERCE: CASE HISTORIES: To more precisely assess the &#147;personality&#147; 
  of the corporate &#147;person,&#147; a checklist is employed, using actual diagnostic 
  criteria of the World Health Organization and the DSM-IV, the standard diagnostic 
  tool of psychiatrists and psychologists. The operational principles of the corporation 
  give it a highly anti-social &#147;personality&#148;: It is self-interested, 
  inherently amoral, callous and deceitful; it breaches social and legal standards 
  to get its way; it does not suffer from guilt, yet it can mimic the human qualities 
  of empathy, caring and altruism. Four case studies, drawn from a universe of 
  corporate activity, clearly demonstrate harm to workers, human health, animals 
  and the biosphere. Concluding this point-by-point analysis, a disturbing diagnosis 
  is delivered: the institutional embodiment of laissez-faire capitalism fully 
  meets the diagnostic criteria of a &#147;psychopath.&#148;</p>
<p>MINDSET: But what is the ethical mindset of corporate players? Should the institution 
  or the individuals within it be held responsible?</p>
<p>The people who work for corporations may be good people, upstanding citizens 
  in their communities&#151;but none of that matters when they enter the corporation&#146;s 
  world. As Sam Gibara, Chairman of Goodyear Tire, explains, &#147;If you really 
  had a free hand, if you really did what you wanted to do that suited your personal 
  thoughts and your personal priorities, you&#146;d act differently.&#147;</p>
<p>Ray Anderson, CEO of Interface, the world&#146;s largest commercial carpet 
  manufacturer, had an environmental epiphany and re-organized his $1.4 billion 
  company on sustainable principles. His company may be a beacon of corporate 
  hope, but is it an exception to the rule? </p>
<p>MONSTROUS OBLIGATIONS: A case in point: Sir Mark Moody-Stuart recounts an exchange 
  between himself (at the time Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell), his wife and a 
  motley crew of Earth First activists who arrived on the doorstep of their country 
  home. The protesters chanted and stretched a banner over their roof that read, 
  &#147;MURDERERS.&#147; The response of the surprised couple was not to call 
  the police, but to engage their uninvited guests in a civil dialogue, share 
  concerns about human rights and the environment and eventually serve them tea 
  on their front lawn. Yet, as the Moody-Stuarts apologize for not being able 
  to provide soy milk for their vegan critics&#146; tea, Shell Nigeria is flaring 
  unrivaled amounts of gas, making it one of the world's single worst sources 
  of pollution. And all the professed concerns about the environment do not spare 
  Ken Saro Wiwa and eight other activists from being hanged for opposing Shell's 
  environmental practices in the Niger Delta. </p>
<p>The Corporation exists to create wealth, and even world disasters can be profit 
  centers. Carlton Brown, a commodities trader, recounts with unabashed honesty 
  the mindset of gold traders while the twin towers crushed their occupants. The 
  first thing that came to their minds, he tells us, was: &#147;How much is gold 
  up?&#147; </p>
<p>PLANET INC.: You&#146;d think that things like disasters, or the purity of 
  childhood, or even milk, let alone water or air, would be sacred. But no. Corporations 
  have no built-in limits on what, who or how much they can exploit for profit. 
  In the fifteenth century, the enclosure movement began to put fences around 
  public grazing lands so that they might be privately owned and exploited. Today, 
  every molecule on the planet is up for grabs. In a bid to own it all, corporations 
  are patenting animals, plants, even your DNA. </p>
<p>Around things too precious, vulnerable, sacred or important to the public interest, 
  governments have, in the past, drawn protective boundaries against corporate 
  exploitation. Today, governments are inviting corporations into domains from 
  which they were previously barred. </p>
<p>PERCEPTION MANAGEMENT : The Initiative Corporation spends $22 billion worldwide 
  placing its clients&#146; advertising in every imaginable&#151;and some unimaginable&#151;media. 
  One new medium: very young children. Their &#147;Nag Factor&#147; study dropped 
  jaws in the world of child psychiatry. It was designed not to help parents cope 
  with their children&#146;s nagging, but to help corporations design their ads 
  and promotions so that children would nag for their products more effectively. 
  Initiative Vice President Lucy Hughes elaborates: &#147;You can manipulate consumers 
  into wanting, and therefore buying your products. It&#146;s a game.&#147;</p>
<p>Today people can become brands. And brands can build cities. And university 
  students can pay for their educations by shilling on national television for 
  a credit card company. And a corporation even owns the rights to the popular 
  song &#147;Happy Birthday.&#148; Do you ever get the feeling it&#146;s all a 
  bit much? Corporations have invested billions to shape public and political 
  opinion. When they own everything, who will stand for the public good?</p>
<p>THE PRICE OF WHISTLEBLOWING: It turns out that standing for the public good 
  is an expensive proposition. Ask Jane Akre and Steve Wilson, two investigative 
  reporters fired by Fox News after they refused to water down a story on rBGH, 
  a synthetic hormone widely used in the United States (but banned in Europe and 
  Canada) to rev up cows&#146; metabolism and boost their milk production. Because 
  of the increased production, the cows suffer from mastitis, a painful infection 
  of the udders. Antibiotics must then be injected, which find their way into 
  the milk, and ultimately reduce people&#146;s resistance to disease. </p>
<p>Fox demanded that they rewrite the story, and ultimately fired Akre and Wilson. 
  Akre and Wilson subsequently sued Fox under Florida&#146;s whistle-blower statute. 
  They proved to a jury that the version of the story Fox would have had them 
  put on the air was false, distorted or slanted. Akre was awarded $425,000. Then 
  Fox appealed, the verdict was overturned on a technicality, and Akre lost her 
  award. [For more information on the case see www.foxbghsuit.com]</p>
<p>DEMOCRACY LTD.: Democracy is a value that the corporation just doesn&#146;t 
  understand. In fact, corporations have often tried to undo democracy if it is 
  an obstacle to their single-minded drive for profit. From a 1934 business-backed 
  plot to install a military dictator in the White House (undone by the integrity 
  of one U.S. Marine Corps General, Smedley Darlington Butler) to present-day 
  law-drafting, corporations have bought military might, political muscle and 
  public opinion.</p>
<p>And corporations do not hesitate to take advantage of democracy&#146;s absence 
  either. One of the most shocking stories of the twentieth century is Edwin Black&#146;s 
  recounting IBM&#146;s strategic alliance with Nazi Germany&#151;one that began 
  in 1933 in the first weeks that Hitler came to power and continued well into 
  World War II.</p>
<p>FISSURES: The corporation may be trying to render governments impotent, but 
  since the landmark WTO protest in Seattle, a rising wave of networked individuals 
  and groups have decided to make their voices heard. Movements to challenge the 
  very foundations of the corporation are afoot: The charter revocation movement 
  tried to bring down oil giant Unocal; a groundbreaking ballot initiative in 
  Arcata, California, put a corporate agenda in the public spotlight in a series 
  of town hall meetings; in Bolivia, the population fought and won a battle against 
  a huge transnational corporation brought in by their government to privatize 
  the water system; in India nearly 99% of the basmati patent of RiceTek was overturned; 
  and W. R. Grace and the U.S. government&#146;s patent on Neem was revoked.</p>
<p>As global individuals take back local power, a growing re-invigoration of the 
  concept of citizenship is taking root. It has the power to not only strip the 
  corporation of its seeming omnipotence, but to create a feeling and an ideology 
  of democracy that is much more than its mere institutional version.</p>
