      <p><font size="+1">When we see how Seven natural </font><font size="+1">circles 
        fit perfectly together, touching each other at Twelve points, while forming 
        a symbol of Beauty (the Star of David) in their midst, we can see how 
        these Seven were also present as a geometrical pattern in the mind of 
        God before they were ever brought to bear upon the process of creation, 
        the history of the world, or upon the doctrines of Israel. Seven 360-degree 
        circles equal 2,520. This is the first number that all of the other numbers 
        on the Tree of Life (1 to 10) divide into equally:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 1 = 2,520</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 2 = 1,260</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 3 = 840</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 4 = 630</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 5 = 504</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 6 = 420</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 7 = 360</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 8 = 315</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 9 = 280</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="+1">2,520 divided by 10 = 252</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">There is a story that relates how the 360-degree circle became

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&quot;Osiris was 
        the offspring of an intrigue between the Earth god, Seb, and the Sky god, 
        Nut. The Greeks identified his parents with their own deities Cronus and 
        Reah. When the Sun god Ra perceived that his wife Nut had been unfaithful 
        to him he declared with a curse that she should be delivered of a child 
        in NO month and in NO year...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But the goddess had 
        another lover, the God Thoth or Hermes as the Greeks call him, </font><font size="+1">(and 
        Moses as we call him)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">, 
        and he, playing at draughts with the Moon, won from her a seventy-second 
        part of every day, (20 minutes). And having compounded FIVE whole days 
        out of these parts he added them to the Egyptian year of 360 days.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">This was the mythical 
        origin of the Five supplementary days which the Egyptians annually inserted 
        at the end of every year in order to establish harmony between Lunar and 
        Solar time. On these Five days, regarded as outside the year of Twelve 
        months, the curse of the Sun did not rest, and the child was born on the 
        first of them.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
