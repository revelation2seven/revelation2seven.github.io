  <p><font size="+1">We do not want to cover the same distance that we already 
    have in the 4th and 5th chapters of this work concerning the Universal nature 
    of Christ and the return of the Divine Feminine Principle to its previous 
    and now rightful place in the spiritual order of Life...except to say again 
    that they represent a state of consciousness that has not only passed directly 
    over the mind of Rome on its way to the West, but which is now leaving it, 
    and its patriarchal view of the world, behind for good, to be stored away 
    in the museum of the past. This will actually be a wonderful place to visit, 
    a great Pyramidal structure in which every philosophical artifact and theological 
    relic that proved too burdensome to carry into the light of the coming age 
    will be stored. There will be a doorway into this structure, so that we can 
    revisit these ideas when we need to, and to tell our children about them; 
    but the top of it--the Pinnacle--will be capped off, so that these ideas cannot 
    rise to the top again. The capstone, of course, will be a smaller Pyramid, 
    one whose lines will merge at the point at which all things in the Universe 
    are connected, giving meaning not only to the mystery of Christ but to Life 
    itself. In the process the office of priest will pass once and for all out 
    of the hands of those who assumed it by force, and control it by decree, to 
    those who have been called to it by God, and who can interpret the oracles:</font></p>

        Theologians Urge Discussion on Female Priests</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">MINNEAPOLIS...The 
        leading organization of Roman Catholic theologians in the United States 
        overwhelmingly urged Friday that the church continue discussing the possibility 
        of ordaining women to the priesthood.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Concluding 
        a yearlong process of study, members of the Catholic Theological Society 
        of America...challanged a 1995 Vatican ruling, which said the church's 
        teaching limiting the priesthood to males has been &quot;set forth infallibly&quot; 
        and is therefore beyond reconsideration. Their resolution was very narrowly 
        targeted. It did not take a position for or against the ordination of 
        women to the priesthood nor did it question the obligation of Catholics 
        to follow Pope John Paul II's May 1994 apostolic letter declaring that 
        the church could not ordain female priests.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">What 
        the theologians disputed was a later ruling, issued in November 1995 by 
        the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by Joseph 
        Cardinal Ratzinger. Although the Pope himself had not invoked the term 
        infallible, the Congregation did, appearing to close all debate on the 
        topic even more completely than the Pope's letter had...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The 
        entire study was commended by the society's nine-member board which also 
        endorsed its conclusion...The 1995 Vatican ruling did not contend that 
        the Pope had himself declared the church's position on ordination infallible, 
        exercising the solemn papal authority of teaching infallibly.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Instead, 
        the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith based its ruling on other, 
        older grounds for infallibility--that it had been taught universally by 
        the bishops, was based on Scripture and had been constantly upheld by 
        Catholic tradition.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The 
        study released here declared that &quot;legitimate questions can be raised 
        about each of these reasons, and their probative force.&quot; The study 
        argues, for example, that the majority opinion among biblical scholars 
        is that Jesus chose MEN as his Twelve Apostles for &quot;their symbolic 
        role as 'patriarchs' of restored Israel&quot; and not because he meant 
        them to be prototypes of the ordained priestly ministers whose offices 
        were defined much later in the church's history.</font></p>

        study recognizes that traditionally women were not ordained as <font size="3">(Catholic)</font> 
        priests or bishops but, says the argument, that the traditional practice 
        is decisive is open to question in this case because so much of it, including 
        many of the ancient writers cited in Vatican documents, was based on the 
        conviction, which the church now rejects, of female inferiority. </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The

    read Uta Ranke-Heinemann's <i>Eunuchs For the Kingdom of Heaven, Women, Sexuality, 
    and the Catholic Church. </i>In fact Catholics everywhere would do well to 
    take to heart all that has been written from such true spiritual convictions 
    over the centuries about the church and its practices. They would also do 
    well to realize that over half the people in the world around them are not 
    Catholic, (and for many of these same critical reasons), and have absolutely 
    no craving in the heart whatsoever to become one. And as such great numbers 
    of these are every bit as close to the kingdom of heaven as Catholics might 
    imagine they themselves to be. The question follows then, if the Pope's opinions 
    and proclamations have no bearing on the beliefs, or on spiritual well-being 
    and salvation of half the world's peoples, or for that matter of almost half 
    of Christendom, how can they have any real bearing on the spiritual well-being 
    or salvation of Catholics? Of course, without access to the oracles how could 
    he but fail to interpret them properly, but in turn how can the rest of the 
    church but fail to find the means and the authority to correct him?</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The great mass of Catholics in the world today have been 
    born into the religion, (or conscripted into it), and so find themselves there 
    by historic circumstances. And the rituals and other trappings of Catholic 
    worship, as deeply mystical and solemn as they are, are enough in themselves 
    to keep them there. There is something about them that all the preaching, 
    and all the reasoning, from Protestant pulpits can not replace. (They are 
    also capable of drawing the soul into that central place of one's very own 
    being where Christ indeed resides). But when we mix these mystical elements 
    with the doctrines and external practices of the church itself, we encounter 
    the &quot;problem&quot; of Catholicism. Part of this problem, ironically, 
    is that it too often &quot;practices what it preaches,&quot; at least from 
    the top down. And it is exactly here where we encounter the anachronism of 
    the Roman church, and the source of our struggle with it in these times. It 
    is too tied to both its own wicked past, and to its own imperfect understandings 
    of the Nature of God, and of the operation of Their Hands, of which it will 
    not repent. Not only is its official behavior tied directly to the past held 
    dictates of worldly men, and not to the hidden teachings of the true Christ, 
    but they are rooted in the obsessions of such tortured and twisted minds as 
    the likes of St. Augustine himself:</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The following excerpt is from Thomas Cahill's <i>How the 
    Irish Saved Civilization</i>:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&quot;Just thirty 
        years before Patricius was brought in chains to Ireland, another teenager 
        with a similar background--a Romanized African--came all too willingly...to 
        the seething capital of Roman Africa. &quot;To Carthage I came,&quot; 
        recalled Augustine later, &quot;where there sang all around me in my ears 
        a cauldron of unholy loves. As yet I loved no one, yet I loved to love, 
        and out of a deep-seated need, I hated myself for not being needy. I pursued 
        whoever--whatever might be lovable, in love with love...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Augustine tells us 
        everything--his jealousies in infancy, his thieving as a boy, his stormy 
        relationship with his over-bearing mother (the ever-certain Monica), his 
        years of philandering, his breakdowns, his shameful love for an unnamed 
        peasant woman, whom he finally sends away. His self-loathing is as modern 
        as that of a character in Camus or Beckett--and as concrete: &quot;I carried 
        inside of me a cut and a bleeding soul, and how to get rid of it I just 
        didn't know. I sought every pleasure--the countryside, sports, fooling 
        around, the peace of a garden, friends and good company, sex, reading. 
        My soul floundered in the void--and came back upon me. For where could 
        my heart flee from my heart? Where could I escape from myself?...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Augustine wanted 
        Truth...such a pressure-cooker psyche can settle for nothing else. He 
        soon abandoned the simple, emotional Catholicism of his mother and adopted 
        something more exclusive...the religion of Mani, a Persian syncretist 
        who had taken this and that from here and there and come up with something 
        that can only strike us as a California cult--a little Christian symbolism, 
        a large dose of Zoroastrian dualism, and some of the quiet refinements 
        of Buddhism. It was called Manicheism. For a while, it left Augustine 
        off the hook. For one thing it absolved him from any responsibility for 
        his raging lusts...It was a made-to-order religion for a smart young provincial 
        who needed to explore every dark corner of the boiling city and experience 
        every dark pleasure it had to offer--and at the same time think himself 
        above the herd. But it couldn't keep up with Augustine's fearlessly inquiring 
        mind. Like Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormonism, it was full of assertions, 
        but could yield no intellectual system to nourish a great intellect...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Who else, Augustine 
        asks himself, even talks of these things? And then the answer comes to 
        him: Saul of Tarsus, the wirey, bald-headed Jew whose awkward, importunate 
        letters, signed &quot;Paul,&quot; the Christians have been using as scripture: 
        &quot;For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against 
        the flesh:and these are contrary one to the other; so that ye cannot do 
        the things that ye would.&quot;...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Augustine begins 
        to read Paul seriously. </font><font size="+1">(see 2 Peter 3:15,16)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">. 
        He entertains the possibility that Plato </font><font size="+1">(his philosopher 
        of choice)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
        even has something wrong...Has the great Plato mistakenly equated knowledge 
        with virtue? For if the flesh and the spirit are at war, isn't the human 
        enterprise doomed to failure--even when joined by the most exalted philosophical 
        types? Musn't Paul be closer to the mark when he says...&quot;For whom 
        God did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image 
        of his Son...&quot; In other words, if we mud-spattered human beings are 
        ever to ascend to the Truth, we can do it only because God, a force ineffably 
        greater than our war-torn selves, has predestined us and calls us upward. 
        We will never make it on our own steam...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">If the ancient eastern 
        (or Greek) church has many &quot;fathers&quot;--theologians who articulated 
        the classical formulations of faith to the Greco-Roman world--the ancient 
        western (or Latin) church has only one worth speaking of: Augustine. Out 
        of his interior dialogues with Plato and Paul, he formulated the doctrine 
        of original sin--the sin of Adam and Eve, passed from generation to generation 
        in the fleshly act of generativity. (OF &quot;SEX&quot;). &quot;As in 
        Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.&quot;...</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Augustine's Christ is almost the opposite of John Paul's. 
    His Jesus is not only human to the core but he is in almost every way as himself 
    now, A STRUGGLING CELIBATE MALE, (see Hebrews 5:7-9)--whose virtues from the 
    very womb of his VIRGIN mother cannot be attained to in this life without 
    renouncing the sin of Adam. For Augustine almost all perfection (hence the 
    historical world-view of the Catholic church) lies in the afterlife, after 
    the physical battles of this age are complete. And the very most he can make 
    of Paul, stumbling all over Paul's metaphors, is the same. He cannot grasp 
    Paul's meanings, his use of the term &quot;the flesh,&quot; which for Paul 
    includes the entire lower world of the natural senses, including man's innate 
    inability to interpret the sacred Scriptures from an elevated, allegorical 
    and metaphorical, and epic point of view. Paul's &quot;woman&quot; is not 
    female. His &quot;flesh&quot; is a lower, worldly state of mind. And his celibacy 
    is not borne of any disdain for the act, or rather the very sacrament (the 
    pure spiritual ecstasy) of sexuality, itself. His struggle is borne in his 
    determination to keep himself pure for it. Paul's desire was to partake in 
    sexual union with his own eternal soul-mate alone, the one he could see that 
    God would provide for him in at the end of the age, as it is written: <i>For 
    the kingdom of heaven is like a certain King who made a marriage for His son. 
    </i>(Matthew 22:2). Paul not only had access to the Oracle but to the hidden 
    language of the Oracle as well.</font></p>

    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In 410, Rome, the 
        Eternal City, fell to Alaric the Goth. The moral accusations against the 
        Christian majority by the shrinking pagan community then rose to a final 
        crescendo. Augustine could little appreciate how beside-the-point the 
        pagan criticisms would soon appear. He summons all his powers to write 
        his final masterpiece, &quot;The City of God,&quot; in which human reality 
        is divided in two: Babylon, the City of Man, which necessarily ends in 
        corruption and death, and the New Jerusalem, the City of God, which flourishes 
        eternally BEYOND all strife</font><font size="+1">. (Augustine's City 
        of God, as such, given all the depravities of the human soul, shall never 
        be realized here in the earth below until the very end of time, when the 
        Church shall have at last conquered the world with its message and delivered 
        up the kingdom to God)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Augustine's enemies 
        are many. He crosses swords with Pelagius, an egregiously fat British 
        monk, who posits that God's grace is not always needed, that men, unassisted, 
        can do good with the aid of their rational minds and their goodwill. Pelagius 
        is a sort of a Norman Vincent Peale, who thinks everyone who really wants 
        to can pull himself by is own bootstraps. It is a case of Pelagius's &quot;Be 
        all you can be!&quot; versus Augustine's &quot;Just as I am without one 
        plea.&quot; Pelagius is also an elitist who believes that some men--the 
        nice educated ones--are better than others. Augustine smells the Platonic 
        fallacy, the equation of knowledge with virtue, and attacks mercilessly. 
        He scores an easy win. </font><font size="+1">(We have not abandoned Augustine 
        yet, and still stand with him here. But he is fast deteriorating)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">He is surrounded, 
        as are all the African Catholic Bishops of his day, by Donatists, heretics 
        who deny that the grace of the sacraments can be conferred through the 
        office of an unworthy priest, but in all other respects resemble their 
        Catholic brethren. For Augustine the sacraments of the Church are profoundly 
        necessary: without their aid all men would in their inevitable weakness 
        succumb to evil...AUGUSTINE ALIGNS HIMSELF WITH THE CIVIL ARM TO PERSECUTE 
        THE DONATISTS AND BRING THEM FORCIBLY WITHIN THE WALLS OF CATHOLICISM. 
        HE SUBSEQUENTLY WRITES THE FIRST CATHOLIC JUSTIFICATION FOR STATE PERSECUTION 
        OF THOSE IN ERROR: error has no rights; to disbelieve in forced conversions 
        is to deny the power of God; and God must whip the son he receives--</font><font size="+1"><i>per 
        molestias eruditio </i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(&quot;true 
        education begins with physical abuse.&quot;). This from the man who condemned 
        the &quot;punishments and cruel threats&quot; of his childhood classroom. 
        Augustine, the last great man of Roman antiquity is going over the edge. 
        The doctrine he has enunciated will echo down the ages in the cruelist 
        infamies, executed with the highest justification. AUGUSTINE, THE FATHER 
        OF MANY FIRSTS, IS ALSO THE FATHER OF THE INQUISITION.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In his old age, Augustine 
        is challenged by the Juilian of Eclanum, a young, aristocratically educated, 
        married bishop, a species of Pelagian, who finds distasteful Augustine's 
        theories of original sin--or at least some of their implications. Augustine, 
        who, as we saw, believed that God had predestined each of us from all 
        eternity, therefore finds it necessary to assume that God will condemn 
        to hellfire all the unbaptized--even infants who die without the sacrament. 
        Augustine justifies God's justice as inscrutable. Julian counters that 
        Augustine's God is a cruel tyrant. Augustine assumes that original sin 
        is passed along in the very fluids of procreation and that sexual intercourse, 
        because it involves a loss of rational control, is always at least venially 
        sinful--and should be indulged in as little as possible. (Remember how 
        important control--the opposite of chaos--was to the ancients: Augustine's 
        is an argument that could have been made by a Stoic or Buddhist, as well 
        as a Christian). Julian informs Augustine that he has sex with his wife 
        whenever and wherever he </font><font size="+1">(they?)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
        feels like it. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Augustine 
        explodes:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&quot;Really, really, 
        is that your experience? So you would not have married couples restrain 
        that evil...? So you would have them jump into bed whenever they like, 
        whenever they feel tickled by desire. Far be it from them to postpone 
        this itch until bedtime: let's have your 'legitimate union of bodies' 
        whenever your 'natural good' is excited. If this is the sort of married 
        life you lead, don't drag up your experience in debate.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&quot;With a growing 
        exaltation of celibacy as the proper state for the spiritual elite, an 
        increasing clericalization of the Western church, a concentration of power--identified 
        with authority--at Rome, and a Pope assuming a spiritualized version of 
        the imperial mantle, it is little wonder that the teachings of Augustine 
        of Hippo found largely uncritical favour.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Pope Leo the Great 
        (440-461) forbade married men to put away their wives upon ordination, 
        but decreed that they were henceforth to live with them as brother and 
        sister. Sex was too innately sinful to have anything to do with love, 
        or for clergymen to so much as contemplate it with their wives...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">An all-male teaching 
        authority in the Church, celibate by compulsion and brought up to regard 
        sex as a sin (instead of a sacrament), could only regard women as a threat. 
        All the markings of a grotesque, and--tragically--largely unconscious, 
        distortion of the Gospel and of its implications were thus at hand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Henceforth there 
        was always a danger of a schizoid separation of religion from life. Sexuality 
        was now a subject quite unsuitable for prayer--other than in groveling 
        repentance with a sense of perpetual guilt! The early fifteenth century 
        prayer by Isobel to our Lord, the King of kings, was either the prayer 
        of a blasphemer--or that of a perfectly normal Celtic woman in love!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Perhaps most sadly 
        of all, clerical concubinage, with all the degradation both of women in 
        general and of the men who practiced it, was to be a more or less winked-at 
        perpetual scandal throughout the subsequent history of the Western Church...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The real mischief 
        of Augustine's distorted vision and its too-ready acceptance at Rome was 
        that he succeeded in removing the Church's gaze from the Blessed Creation, 
        which God created good and which is the transfigured image of its Creator. 
        Henceforth it would be fixed upon Adam's fall and the doctrine of Original 
        Sin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Henceforth the whole 
        interpretation of the Gospel began with Original Sin (and not infrequently 
        with the idea of transmitted guilt as well). The Blessed Creation slowly 
        and inexorably began to be pushed to the outer fringes of Western theological 
        thought and mind.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Cardinal O'Connor 
        has given tacit support to a controversial movement within the Catholic 
        Church to elevate the Virgin Mary to equal status with Jesus Christ as 
        the Redeemer for mankind's salvation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The proposed new 
        dogma would expand the concept of the Holy Trinity, the guiding precept 
        of the Catholic faith that there is one God in three &quot;persons&quot;--the 
        Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">As described in 
        the cover story in the current Newsweek, &quot;there would be a kind of 
        Holy Quartet, with Mary playing the multiple roles of daughter of the 
        Father, mother of the Son and spouse of the Holy Spirit.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">While not a new 
        idea, the move to give Mary a bigger role in Catholicism is being given 
        new impetus by a petition effort that so far has collected more than 4.3 
        million signatures around the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The petition has 
        been sent to the Vatican through the efforts of Mark Miravalle, the author 
        of several books on Mary...Miravalle and other Mary devotees want the 
        Pope to declare her the &quot;Co-Redemptrix, Mediatrix of All Graces and 
        Advocate for the People of God.&quot;...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Rather than being 
        a mere human vessel for Christ on Earth. Mary--like Christ--would also 
        be a mediator between God and man.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Critics contend 
        that the movement is cultlike and seeks to deify Mary <font size="3"> 
        </font> and that it his being driven by end-of-millennium hysterics, including 
        stepped up reports of apparitions of Mary in the form of moving or weeping 
        statues. <font size="3"> (Always with a Papal message it appears)</font>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">They say that a 
        new papal elevation of Mary would anger other Christians who do not worship 
        Mary. A special Vatican commission of scholars has advised Pope John Paul 
        against such a move, although the Pope remains a staunch advocate of the 
        Blessed Virgin.</font></p>
