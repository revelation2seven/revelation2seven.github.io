  <b>Lately it has been my distinct privilege to be in the middle of a group conversation 
  about the origins of religion. The emphasis has been on debunking, on exposing 
  the fictional roots of allegedly divine events that continue to control so many 
  of world's minds, and complicate so many of the world's problems...</b></p>

      is much that he sees quite clearly. We follow him where he is correct. And 
      we employ his, and others', thoughts on these matters as points of conversation 
      and stepping stones toward a greater and more concise world view. We allow 
      Kaminski to open up the dialogue). </p>

<p><b> &quot;Many of these thinkers have lately focused their perceptual skills 
  on the Macchiavellian machinations of the Jews, who claim to espouse an ethical 
  ideology yet are primarily known in contemporary society as master manipulators, 
  and revealed by their own holy scriptures as murderous maniacs who consider 
  all non-Jews somewhat less than human, rendering their suspect creed profoundly 
  offensive to all compassionate humans who encounter it.</b></p>
<p><b>But this is no anti-Jewish rant. The adherents of all other spiritual disciplines 
  suffer from a similar snobbery, even if their claims to exclusivity, divine 
  sanction, and being the only true creeds are somewhat less vicious than the 
  habit of Jews to refer to religious groups other than their own by using the 
  names of lower animals &#151; cockroaches, grasshoppers, and cattle (also known 
  as goyim) being the most frequent insults they typically use.</b></p>
<p><b>Still, Catholics have their own negative image, most notably the magical 
  creation of their dogma some 1700 years ago that resulted in a worldwide pogrom 
  against pagans (that, oddly, excluded Jews), which began the process now known 
  as the Dark Ages, and carried out a process of ruthless extermination that decimated 
  the native populations of the New World some six centuries prior to our own. 
  Catholics also have their own sinister intelligence operations (Knights of Malta, 
  Opus Dei, and the Jesuits), the scrutiny of which has probably created more 
  conspiracy theorists than anything except those sleuths bent on ferreting out 
  facts about the worldwide Jewish conspiracy or the ever-elusive Illuminati.</b></p>
<p><b>But a Catholic friend of mine remains ever eager to point out that it is 
  the Protestants who are always let off the hook in any debate about the negative 
  influences of religion, but shouldn't be, as German Lutherans and English Puritans 
  have been the most eager and efficient killers in world history, if you consider 
  the still-continuing genocide of the natives in North America and the death 
  totals from two World Wars &#151; and numerous other colonialist abuses &#151; 
  in the 20th century. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(We have 
  not let them off the hook)</font><b>.</b></p>
<p><b>Arguably the most ancient among the still-existing but ever popular religions 
  in the world today &#151; and the one where real scholars (not those university 
  idiots) will tell you Western Civilization really came from &#151; the Hindus 
  still maintain very high standards for atrocious behavior with the social acceptability 
  of the burning of women (checked out the bride-burning statistics lately?) and 
  the continuing habit of strictly regimenting their society according to race, 
  resulting in the daily persecution and extermination of the poor Dalits, also 
  known as the Untouchables, who are just regular people with a darker skin pigmentation 
  than most. In addition, the Hindu proclivity for burning and raping Muslims, 
  and lately cozying up to cynical Israel on weapons deals, make them as scurrilious 
  as all the rest of those repressive religions whose main objective is to keep 
  their people powerless by focusing on the hereafter and ignoring the here-and-now.</b></p>
<p><b>One cache of amazing information I've recently received is from an Odinist, 
  who finds meaning in the historical legends of the Norse deities, and who has 
  learned about a fascinating thread of history from a tome called the Oera Linda 
  book, which details how a Baltic civilization so ancient as not to be remembered 
  by most actually colonized the Mediterranean basin and triggered the ascension 
  of classical Greek culture. (No, I don&#146;t know if I believe it, but it&#146;s 
  a fascinating thesis.)</b></p>
<p><b>But he recently ran afoul of Islamic partisans when he bemoaned the influx 
  of African and Arab immigrants into previously all-white northern Europe, with 
  the argument that it is right and proper for ethnic groups to exist among themselves, 
  as long as they harbor no Hitlerian delusions (which the Israelis appear to 
  have copied) that the rest of the world should be stamped out in favor of absolute 
  hegemony by The Chosen Master Race.</b></p>
<p><b>The Muslims in our discussion group took him to task for denigrating the 
  presence of immigrants in his part of the world, without perhaps realizing what 
  so many others realize &#151; that the push for diversity in so many previously 
  one-color countries is actually a worldwide plot to diminish the individual, 
  regional ethnic authorities that are generally representative of their local 
  populations. </b><b>A worldwide plot? I'll spell this out in more detail in 
  a moment (as if you can't guess who I'm talking about), but first, let's finish 
  with Earth's religious spectrum, or as far as I am able to consider it.</b></p>
<p><b>Back to the Muslims, these days the most denigrated and vilified religious 
  group in the American mind, largely because of Jewish control of U.S. media 
  (the Jews want to steal Islamic land and the U.S. wants to continuing stealing 
  Islamic oil). To my mind, the Muslims have never attacked America, unless you&#146;re 
  one of those dimwitted dupes who still believes the U.S. government&#146;s version 
  of 9/11 and all those suspicious terror bombings that bear the unmistakable 
  imprint of CIA Black Ops.</b></p>
<p><b>Like Christian dogma, Islamic scriptures generally preach peace, but are 
  commendable in their outlook in that they recognize the right of others to worship 
  as they please, a fact that is not widely known in the West because of all the 
  terror-mongering by Jews. Just read the New York papers if you don&#146;t believe 
  me on this. </b><b>Yet, as each creed contains its own brand of stormtroopers, 
  so Muslims have theirs, most visibly represented by the strident imams of Iran, 
  who thankfully are losing their grip on that most-ancient of countries to a 
  democratic, secular movement, which may actually succeed if the United States 
  and Israel don&#146;t nuke them off the face of the earth first.</b></p>
<p><b>If Islamics have something to be ashamed about, it would be that they haven&#146;t 
  noticed their countries are all controlled by Western-money whores pretending 
  to be kings and presidents, and if any group is going to aspire toward preaching 
  righteousness, it probably better start by having honest leaders who have not 
  given up the game to their oppressors just for a few dinars.</b></p>
<p><b>In that sense, the Iranian imams are to be congratulated for throwing off 
  the manipulative yoke of Western oppression and at least establishing a government 
  of, by, and for their own people. Their achievement was a rarity in world history, 
  and if they executed a few people for violating a few arcane religious rules, 
  at least they did not murder their own citizens at the behest of some foreign 
  power, as so many truculent Islamic nations polluted by Western influences do 
  now.</b></p>
<p><b>Many seemingly wise people think that Buddhism is a creative way to address 
  human spiritual needs, since that philosophy is so self-centered and so nebulous 
  that it can't possibly harm other religious groups, but that is not exactly 
  the case. Just like all the other creeds, Buddhism is based on the principle 
  that somewhere else is more important than here, and as a consequence plays 
  no role in political reality, as vividly evidenced by the Dalai Lama's conspicuous 
  absence from contemporary political discourse, perhaps because he's too busy 
  throwing parties for celebrities in and around Washington, D.C.</b></p>
<p><b>We could at this point delve into a few more less-populous creeds practiced 
  in faraway places, but the information would be probably be wasted on many TV-lobotomized 
  American minds.</b></p>
<p><b>To complete the spectrum of thought about creeds (so we can get to the good 
  stuff), it is worth mentioning just a bit about the division of American Christianity 
  into a gaggle of mostly evil subcults.</b></p>
<p><b>Did you ever wonder why the nation of Israel bought Jerry Falwell a passenger 
  jet? Or why they won&#146;t allow him to talk about Christianity when he&#146;s 
  in Israel?</b></p>
<p><b>Beyond the Catholic church (which many people say is a watered-down version 
  of its old self since the Vatican II document was approved during the 1960s 
  and masses began to be spoken in English), Christians known as Protestants are 
  divided up into innumerable variations, which can be best generalized into two 
  groups: old-line and evangelical. The old-line churches (Episcopal, Presbyterian, 
  Methodist, Congregational, etc.) are generally unobtrusive, not too demanding 
  of their adherents, and almost completely supportive of the governments which 
  permit them to operate.</b></p>
<p><b>So too are the evangelical denominations, except for the glaring exceptions 
  that they, like the Jews, consider other creeds the spawn of the devil, and 
  generally support violence against others not of their faith, another very Jewish 
  trait (and Hindu, as well). So there we have it, except for Quakers, Taoists, 
  Jains, Wiccans, Shintoists and various assorted New Age conglomerations of worshippers 
  &#151; the spectrum of religions in the world, at least as seen from the United 
  States.</b></p>
<p><b>And each group argues that only their creed is the right one. How can any 
  argument possibly be solved using any of these religious perspectives? Answer: 
  it can&#146;t.</b></p>
<p><b>Let&#146;s go at this from a slightly different angle. Imagine a visitor 
  from outer space were to come down and try to discern a viable representation 
  of human religion. </b><b>Suppose he listened to George W. Bush first. &#147;God 
  told me to bomb Afghanistan!&#148; Then he watched Pat Robertson on television. 
  Then he read of Abe Foxman talking about Mel Gibson&#146;s new movie in the 
  newspapers, especially when Foxman suggests Jews should be allowed to rewrite 
  the Bible.</b></p>
<p><b>With all this heated invective being vented over stories that could not 
  be proven &#151; one way or the other &#151; in any rational sense, do you know 
  what this visitor would conclude? He would conclude that the human race is completely 
  insane. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? HE WOULD BE RIGHT.</b></p>
<p><b>Now, I said all that to say this, to tell you about some interesting facts 
  I&#146;ve have heard in Internet conversations, all of which tend to verify 
  MY CONVICTION THAT ALL RELIGIONS ARE FALSE, meant to be used to control restless 
  populations looking for meaning, and troubled humans with infinite imaginations 
  in finite minds looking for a little consolation for the knowledge they will 
  one day, like all living things, be dead.</b></p>
<p><b>Most revealing was the piece by M-Theory on RumorMillNews (http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=42815 
  ) that Yahweh, the mysterious Old Testament God of both the Jews and Christians, 
  was really a minor Canaanite deity named El Shaddai (a conclusion New Age Sumerian 
  guru Zecharia Sitchin also mentions), and that the name Yahweh was invented 
  in the OT book of Exodus to cover up his real name, because of its embarrasingly 
  shaky Ugaritic pedigree. Further research reveals Psalm 104 to be the Egyptian 
  Hymn to Aten, and the whole compilation of Jewish and Christian myth is little 
  more than a concatenation of mistranslated Egyptian and Sumerian history redacted 
  into a politically advantageous document upon which the passing of the centuries 
  has conferred, for want of rigorous academic analysis, the majestic aura of 
  divinity.</b></p>
<p><b>In &#147;The Christ Conspiracy,&#148; Acharya writes that many religious 
  precepts Christians assume come from the Bible came from Zorastrianism, including 
  the concepts of heaven and hell; the use of water for baptism; the savior born 
  of a virgin mother; personal immortality and the single life of every human 
  soul; and the final tribulation before the Second Coming.</b></p>
<p><b>And thousands of years before the time of the so-called Jesus, there are 
  these interesting facts in the legend of Horus of Egypt: he was born of the 
  virgin Isis-Meri on December 25th in a cave/manger with his birth being announced 
  by a star in the East and attended by three wise men; he performed miracles, 
  exorcised demons and raised El-Azarus (El-Osiris) from the dead. </b></p>
<p><b>Horus also walked on water and delivered a &quot;Sermon on the Mount.&quot; 
  He was crucified between two thieves, buried for three days in a tomb, and resurrected. 
  He was &quot;the Fisher&quot; and was associated with the Fish, Lamb and Lion. 
  Horus was called &quot;the KRST,&quot; or the &quot;Anointed One.&quot; And 
  these Savior events and stories were attributed to many besides Horus long before 
  the alleged time of Jesus, names such as Buddha, Krishna, Mithra, Prometheus, 
  Apollo, Heracles and Zeus, and many more. The legend of saviors just like Jesus 
  had been around a long, long time before Jesus.</b></p>
<p><b>Some insist Christianity is a completely plagiarized religion. The first 
  four Gospels which are the sole foundation of Jesus's existence didn't even 
  show up until around the 4th century. And some of the forgery is so bad that 
  they forgot to check their history with such small items like Nazareth not being 
  in existence in Palestine at the time of Jesus.&#147;The Four Gospels were unknown 
  to the early Christian Fathers. Justin Martyr, the most eminent of the early 
  Fathers, wrote about the middle of the second century. His writings in proof 
  of the divinity of Christ demanded the use of these Gospels, had they existed 
  in his time. He makes more than 300 quotations from the books of the Old<br>
  Testament, and nearly one hundred from the Apocryphal books of the New Testament, 
  but none from the four Gospels. The very names of the Evangelists, Matthew, 
  Mark, Luke and John are never mentioned by Justin &#151; do not occur once in 
  all his writings,&quot; wrote John Remsburg in &#147;The Book Your Church Doesn't 
  Want You To Read.&#148;&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>One of my correspondents wrote, &#147;Christianity, like most religions, 
  was set up to disempower people and control them. It was set up as a political 
  vehicle. Sell people on their unworthiness and guilt and you can control them.&#148;</b></p>
<p><b>Another participant in my e-mail discussions wrote harshly about the events 
  during the formal creation of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine in 325 
  A.D. &#147;They involved death camps, pogroms, book-burnings, and mass executions. 
  We have all been conditioned to believe that the only people capable of doing 
  such acts were Germans and the only<br>
  victims of these acts were Jews. </b></p>
<p><b>&#147;In the first several centuries after the Council of Nicea selected 
  the four Gospels out of 80 then in circulation because only these four presented 
  a divine savior, rather than an itinerant mortal Jewish reformer, advocates 
  of the new state-sanctioned revision of the Judaic tradition used all of these 
  tactics and more. </b></p>
<p><b>&#147;It would be easy for us to lose sight of the millions of persons executed 
  by Judeochristians through a reign of terror that lasted over 500 years and 
  resulted in the burning of the priceless collections of human technology, philosophy, 
  and the humanities as a Judeochristian mob burned the Library at Alexandria.</b></p>
<p><b>&#147;In the summarization of Vlasis Rassias&#146; book &#145;Demolish Them&#146; 
  is found a true account of the first few centuries of the Christian era and 
  the effect of that particular outgrowth of the Abrahamic traditions on our world. 
  The toll in death, suffering, and the attack on Classical Civilization was immense. 
  That the death-cult, borne by wearers of black cassocks, brought about Dark 
  Ages is incontrovertible. The religion masked in &#147;love and light&#148; 
  should be held out for all to see its brutal, barbaric beginnings. As we follow 
  the plans of Christian Zionists in PNAC, the Bush Administration&#146;s guiding 
  council (Program for a New American Century), it is clear that little has changed.&#148;</b></p>
<p><b>Among a list of Christian atrocities from Rassias&#146; book, published 
  only in Greek in the year 2000 (ISBN 960-7748-20-4), Emperor Constantine began 
  a centuries-long run of torture, destruction and extermination of all things 
  not Christian, eradicating ancient Greek temples and stealing their treasures. 
  Subsequent Roman emperors in Constantinople executed everyone not accepting 
  the new Christian faith. Then libraries were burned, and all contrary teachings 
  outlawed. In 380, Christian priests lead the hungry mob against the Temple of 
  Goddess Demeter in Eleusis and try to lynch the hierophants Nestorius and Priskus. 
  The 95-year-old hierophant Nestorius ended the Eleusinian Mysteries and announced 
  the predominance of mental darkness over the human race. Sounds familiar today, 
  doesn&#146;t it?</b></p>
<p><b>For another thousand years, the primary occupation of state-sanctioned Christians 
  was to exterminate those who would not accept the fictional documents constructed 
  into a Bible at the Council of Nicea. Christian barbarism continued well into 
  the future. In 1493, Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella issued an edict 
  demanding death for all those who would not accept &#147;the true faith,&#148; 
  and Columbus and others began slaughtering natives of the Western Hemisphere 
  by the millions, not because they would not accept the faith, but because they 
  could not understand the question, because they could not speak Spanish. (For 
  more information on this part of Christian history, write to the United Confederation 
  of Taino People, uctp1493@yahoo.com) </b></p>
<p><b>Praise be to God!</b></p>
<p><b>Let&#146;s bring God into our discussions!</b></p>
<p><b>If we can just believe in God, everything will be fine! Just ask President 
  Bush. Yeah, right.</b></p>
<p><b>OK, I&#146;ve gone far afield here from my original objective. </b><b>First, 
  I promised to tell you about a worldwide plot that involved opening everyone&#146;s 
  borders (are you listening, you folks in New Mexico?) and flooding countries 
  possessing established ethnic and religious structures with hordes of newcomers 
  to destabilize them and diminish existing authority. </b><b>Who would advocate 
  such a thing?</b></p>
<p><b>You know who. The recurring theme in Jewish history from the time they first 
  migrated into eastern Europe from the northern shore of the Black Sea is that 
  they were unwanted, so they kept to themselves and were persecuted. Or perhaps 
  the reverse was true &#151; that they kept to themselves and had their own peculiar 
  habits, so that&#146;s why they were unwanted. Either way, it was an uneasy 
  situation. </b><b>Stipulations in their holy book, the Talmud, that non-Jews 
  were to be regarded as less than human certainly didn&#146;t help their cause. 
  Nor did their antipathy toward farming and industrial labor, which was the backbone 
  of the Eastern European societies they invaded.</b></p>
<p><b>To their credit, however, the Jews figured out how to solve their problem, 
  or figured out part of it, anyway. They observed the habits of the cultures 
  that rejected them, determined what would be the best ways to overcome the obstacles 
  that confronted them, and mastered the skills necessary to removing the barriers 
  to their comfort and prosperity. These skills, as many of us can see so clearly 
  now, were the manipulation of money (primarily through their time-honored talent 
  for usury and bribery &#151; and you can&#146;t blame someone for bribery unless 
  you blame both the briber and the bribee) and control of what we now call the 
  media, particularly the entertainment media.</b></p>
<p><b>And not to denigrate the Jewish achievement, they worked hard, and they 
  studied hard, coming to dominate the essential fields of law, medicine, and 
  education. The invention of psychology was a particularly sagacious move, the 
  one that finally brought down the church, their principal obstacle to respectability 
  and control.</b></p>
<p><b>Adopting the strategy of the Christian religion, Jews who amassed fortunes 
  through savvy business deals also captured the engines of entertainment &#151; 
  the newspapers and the movie studios, primarily &#151; and soon controlled the 
  minds of most of the Western world. From that vantage point, in control of the 
  banks and the information, it&#146;s kind of surprising that it has taken them 
  this long to gain control of the entire world, which if you look at a picture 
  of the world in 2004, they surely have. </b><b>And it&#146;s a well-deserved 
  triumph. There is much to admire about the consistent solidarity of the Jewish 
  community. </b><b>But much to worry about, too, which takes us back to the subject 
  of religion.</b></p>
<p><b>Let me first say something about religious perspective. It has been my observation 
  in reading various tracts about Jews that all too often complaints originate 
  from those espousing a competing religious discipline, most commonly fundamental 
  Christianity. It has always disturbed me that subjective religious favoritism 
  should be used in criticizing another creed, which inevitably leads to biased, 
  partisan judgments, and leaves the writer deservedly eligible for the charge 
  of hate crime. I have observed this in much literature that could be classified 
  as anti-Semitic, in which hateful terms are clearly the products of jealousies 
  and rivalries with people who simply do things differently, and believe different 
  things.</b></p>
<p><b>I trust the summary judgments on the religions noted above will dispel any 
  notion any reader might have that I am advocating some religious alternative 
  to Judaism, and would remind the reader that making observations on the questionable 
  behavior of political entities (which all churches are) is not a hate crime, 
  and is in no way aimed at those who have no valid perspective on the behavior 
  of those who share the same spiritual and philosophical beliefs.</b></p>
<p><b>That said, there is definitely a worldwide Jewish conspiracy to control 
  the world. Though Russia slipped from their grasp many decades ago, it is fair 
  to say the United States is definitely controlled by Jewish interests on almost 
  every level. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(JEWISH INTERESTS 
  OR ZIONIST INTERESTS? WHILE THEY ARE THE SAME, THEY ARE DIFFERENT)</font><b>.</b></p>
<p><b>The worldwide plot to establish diversity everywhere eliminates the very 
  forces that persecuted Jews throughout their history, so when observing a problem 
  such as the relocation of Africans to northern Europe, or the tidal wave of 
  Mexicans into the United States, it helps to see that as a reinforcement of 
  Jewish control. The white Wasp establishment, or what part of it that has not 
  been bought off by Jewish money, will never trouble them again. The problem 
  has been wiped out by the continuing and deliberate flood of immigrants.</b></p>
<p><b>The problem for all Americans, however, is the little matter of Talmud, 
  the Jewish holy book, that says it&#146;s OK for a Jew to kill a non-Jew, or 
  a Jew to rob a non-Jew. Because that&#146;s exactly what we&#146;re seeing happening 
  all around the world, and especially in America and in the Middle East, where 
  Israel works assiduously every day to exterminate every single one of the indigenous 
  Arab population who dares to stand in its way, while the United States tags 
  along, teaching its sons and daughters to be good killers, just like the Israelis, 
  without really knowing what the real score is.</b></p>
<p><b>Is there any doubt about this? Haven&#146;t 55 years of no-holds-barred 
  terrorism, plus the undeniable capture of the American political system, proved 
  this beyond the merest penumbra of a doubt? </b><b>I would suspect anyone who 
  would oppose this proposition would either be a Jew, or a fake Christian who 
  has been bought off by the Jews, like all those Christian Zionists.</b></p>
<p><b>And here, perhaps, we come to sickest of all the phony religious/political 
  deals that has ever been struck on this planet. Or perhaps just the sickest 
  one since the days of the Roman Empire, when the ascendant Romans gave the Jews 
  special status because they created this fantastic crowd sedative &#151; the 
  Christian religion &#151; that kept the rabble in its place, urged them to turn 
  the other cheek when they were robbed and raped by their betters, and invented 
  a time-tested messiah by stealing bits and pieces of mythological masters from 
  other times and places to keep the peons from rising up against their masters. 
  </b><b>What a great invention that was! It didn&#146;t last forever, but what 
  does? Nevertheless, it lasted almost a millennium, more or less, but when the 
  Roman aristocracy faded out, so did the Jews&#146; privileged position, despite 
  all the intrigues.</b></p>
<p><b>This time around, wouldn&#146;t you know, the Christian religion and the 
  Jews are working together again. Evangelicals are doing everything they can 
  to support Israel&#146;s monstrous policies because they figure, according to 
  the script featured in the Bible&#146;s Book of Revelation, that their wished-for 
  messiah will arrive after Armageddon happens in Israel. The U.S. government 
  appears to be following this script, doing everything it can to make sure it 
  happens.</b></p>
<p><b>Thus, consider this psychotic religious alliance: evangelical Christians 
  support Israel because Israel is intent on blowing itself up, thereby enabling 
  the Christian messiah &#151; you know, the Horus clone and his father El Shaddai 
  &#151; to return to Earth and choose 144,000 of their most pious followers to 
  come and board and trek off to (ha) God knows where. </b><b>The Israelis keep 
  taking money from the evangelicals (as well as all Americans through excessive 
  foreign aid), but prohibit visiting Christians from talking about Jesus while 
  they&#146;re there. The Jews won&#146;t make the mistake they made in Rome. 
  Now, they have the nukes. And a time-tested argument is now on their side, instead 
  of working against them.</b></p>
<p><b>It goes like this. Once you can get people to believe things you can definitely 
  prove are not true, you can get them to believe anything. </b><b>Are you listening, 
  Baby Jesus? No, I didn&#146;t think so. Mythological political constructs don&#146;t 
  hear that well. </b><b>The claim that Israel has a right to steal all that land 
  in the Middle East because of some Biblical reference is utterly false, for 
  a multitude of reasons, only some of which have been alluded to here.</b></p>
<p><b>The human race desperately needs to understand the difference between its 
  need to believe and what it actually believes IN. But by the time we figure 
  that out, it will probably be too late, and the evangelicals will get their 
  wish. The human race, grasshoppers and all, will get that same wish, too &#151; 
  that death wish.</b></p>
