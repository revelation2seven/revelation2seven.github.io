</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Any attempt to reconstruct the developing life and organization 
  of the early church must begin with an acknowledgment that much of our information 
  is meager and fragmentary, and that there is much that is obscure and uncertain. 
  We have no minute books, no diaries, no journals. But we do have scattered letters, 
  reports, treatises, sermons, church manuals. While we could wish for much more 
  additional information, the main lines of development are sufficiently clear.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The mission of Christ was to summon a <i>remnant</i> of Israel 
  to be the saving instrument of God for the redemption of mankind. To accomplish 
  this purpose, he had gathered about him TWELVE disciples, corresponding to the 
  Twelve tribes of Israel...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b>Twelve? Indeed. Follow the course of History, from Genesis 
    in the West to Revelation in the West again. The whole of it has passed right 
    over the head of Rome.</b></p>

<p align="left"><font size="+1">Though the biblical scholar John Allegro fails 
  to see into the depth of the Christ mystery himself--sublime and suprahistorical, 
  and beyond his own immediate comprehension, as it is--he nevertheless comes 
  close to the truth when he says:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They </font>(the rabbis, 
    and the orthodox church fathers who came to define Christianity from the third 
    and fourth centuries on)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> took what 
    they believed to be the essentials of their Faith, discredited any practice 
    or belief which conflicted with their ideas and promulgated their their refined 
    code as the original religion revealed by their god, claiming that over the 
    course of time it had become perverted through man's sin. Certain myths handed 
    down over the centuries...were 'historicized', and theology was made to hang 
    upon the actions and words of their legendary characters as real people. The 
    Jewish 'Exodus-Sinai' myth became thus actual history, belief in every word 
    of which was made obligatory on the faithful as the 'Jesus crucified' story 
    was within a generation or so of its devising made for Christians a central 
    feature of God's redemptive activity in man's history...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today we know this story to have 
    been quite imaginary, and its composition and transmission devised for an 
    esoteric purpose connected with the secret nature of the cult. (At the time 
    of its inception the real nature of the Jesus legend must have been well known, 
    certainly among its originators and, as we can show, even among Jews outside 
    the cult for some considerable time afterwards). But 'orthodox' belief came 
    to insist upon the myth's historicity </font>(for reasons that the orthodox, 
    nor Allegro can understand yet)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    and those who disagreed, including presumably those who knew the truth and 
    wished to preserve it at least among the initiates of the secret society, 
    were driven out into the wilderness.&quot; </font>The End of the Road, by 
    John M. Allegro, pp.8-11<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(continued)...<font size="+1">After Christ had been crucified and buried (Hebrews 
  5:10-14), he appeared again to his disciples (Exodus 23:20-23; 24:10)--first 
  to Peter and then to the Twelve--confirming his mission and entrusting it to 
  them. They returned to Jerusalem <font size="3">(<i>Let the reader understand...</i>Matthew<i> 
  </i>24:15. It was not to any city in Palestine that they returned...Acts 1:12)</font>...</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Judaesaptan.gif" width="607" height="265"></p>
<p><font size="+1">...and there the miracle of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4) occurred, 
  transforming a small band of disciples into a dynamic community with a message 
  and a life that <i>turned the world upside down</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1. <i>The Early Christian Community</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Christian community sprang from the apostolic witness. 
  Christ was the <i>Foundation Stone </i> of the community, and the apostles were 
  the &quot;pillars.&quot; Without the apostles there could have been no Church, 
  for a historical revelation must be reported and announced by those who were 
  <i>eyewitnesses</i> to it. But beyond the stabilizing element of the apostolic 
  testimony, it was a formless community which was gathered by the telling of 
  the Christian story. In the words of Paul: <i>Christ our Passover is sacrificed 
  for us</i>. (1 Corinthians 5:7,8).</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg152.gif" width="480" height="169"></p>
<p align="center">Deuteronomy 21:22,23; Galatians 3:13</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection 
      (thus the First Death): on such the Second Death, (the death of the mortal 
      body itself), hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, 
      and shall reign with Christ a thousand (10 X 10 X 10) years...(Revelation 
      20:6, Revelation 21:16). </p>
    <p align="center">For the preaching of the Cross (the crucifixion of the old 
      nature--the natural, literal man) is to them that perish foolishness; but 
      unto them that are saved it is the Power of God...(1 Corinthians 1:18).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(continued)...<font size="+1">What distinguished this early Christian community 
  was not a pattern of organization but a way of life. &quot;Since our persuasion 
  by the Lord,&quot; Justin Martyr was later to write, &quot;we who valued above 
  all things the acquisition of wealth and possessions now bring what we have 
  into a common stock and communicate to everyone in need <font size="3">(they 
  were in every sense of the word, spiritual communists)</font>; we who hated 
  and destroyed one another, and on account of their different manners would not 
  share the hearth with those of another tribe, now, since the coming of Christ, 
  live on intimate terms with them, and pray for our enemies and endeavor to persuade 
  those who hate us to live according the good precepts of Christ, so that they 
  may become partakers with us of the same joyful hope.&quot; This was true from 
  the very beginning. It was a <i>new society</i> that had come into existence 
  in the midst of the old society--a society in which there were no distinctions 
  of race or class or nationality or culture, a society in which no person should 
  ever be in need or want, a society in which the stranger should feel himself 
  welcome and at home, a society open to all, whether Jew of Gentile, through 
  faith in Christ.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In a sense, it is curious that Christ should have laid down 
  no detailed instruction for the outward organization of the Church. <font size="3">(These 
  instructions were already implicit in the Law and the Prophets, and in the oral 
  traditions of the Essenes)</font>. In this respect, life under the New Covenant 
  differed greatly from the minute prescriptions by which the life of Israel was 
  ordered under the Old Covenant <font size="3">(Understand Jeremiah 31:31-34)</font>. 
  But in a deeper sense, it is not strange that Christ should have left the outer 
  structure of the Church to be shaped by the growing and changing needs of the 
  Christian community, for to do otherwise would have been to run the risk of 
  diverting attention from his basic concern to foster a true fellowship of persons 
  and of centering it instead upon details and organization. Christ had insisted 
  again and again that in the new society there was to be no preeminence. (But 
  also the words: <i>For the mystery of Iniquity doth already work</i>, 2 Thessalonians 
  2:7; Acts 20:25-38; <i>And there must be heresies among you so that they which 
  are approved may be manifest</i>, 1 Cor.11:17-34). When a dispute broke out 
  among the Twelve, after the request of the sons of Zebedee that they be given 
  positions of honor and privilege in the coming kingdom, Jesus acknowledged that 
  in the larger society in which they lived the great ones <font size="3">(the 
  kings, the popes, and presidents)</font> exercised lordship and authority, but, 
  he reminded them, <i>it is not so among you</i>. <font size="3">(Nor must it 
  ever come to be so...John 8:31,32; 1 John 2:18,19)</font>. The principle by 
  which they were to be governed was the one which he had so often repeated, that 
  whosoever would be chief among you shall be a servant </font>(not in the ritual 
  sense as a papal title but in actual reality. John Paul II is presently carried 
  around on a Papal Throne)<font size="+1">.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the outward structure of the Church grew out of the needs 
  of daily life--the sociological needs of individual Christian communities. Actually 
  no fellowship can exist without accepted patterns of doing things and getting 
  things done. Means of conducting business must be devised. <font size="3">(No 
  usury, no oppression, no injustice, no earning one's own living on the labors 
  of other men...Ezekiel 18)</font>...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. <i>The Church orders Its Life</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It has been suggested that &quot;the early church lived like 
  those on the American frontier.&quot; There was no trained clergy. Scattered 
  groups of Christians had been gathered by itinerant evangelists. These itinerants 
  were the ministers, and their duties involved preaching or prophesying and administration 
  of baptism and the Lord's Supper. <font size="3">(Blending the rites of Dionysus 
  with the epic meaning of Passover)</font>. They had been commissioned directly 
  by the Spirit, and were attached to no local congregation...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> <font size="3">(Of course Hudson is not taking into account 
  the early church's direct connection to the religious traditions of upper Europe, 
  and to their already well organized structure of Druid priests, overseers and 
  a presiding High Priest. Aside from the fact that James, and not Peter, was 
  chosen to assume this position among them, it was the early church's intent 
  to dissolve this office with the precepts in Hebrews, chapter 5. The very mystery 
  of Christ itself was now their universal High Priest, until the true high priest 
  of these sacred mysteries should appear again at the end of the age. It was 
  not through other men, or through their religious institutions that the true 
  priests of God are ordained, but by the Holy Spirit of God itself...Herself)</font>. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">...All the believers who had been gathered by the itinerants 
  were styled <i>brethren</i> or <i>saints</i>, and each member of the community 
  was regarded as a <i>priest</i> belonging to the spiritual tribe of Levi. As 
  in all communities, however, there were certain routine tasks to be performed. 
  Someone had to determine when and where they should meet, to make the necessary 
  preparations, and to preside once the people were gathered together...Following 
  Jewish customs, these administrative responsibilities were usually assumed by 
  a committee of elders--called <i>bishops</i> or <i>presbyters</i>--and in some 
  places they were assisted by <i>deacons</i> and <i>widows</i>. The pattern of 
  administration, however, was far from standardized. In some centers the committee 
  structure persisted well into the second century. In other centers this pattern 
  of organization was displaced by what seemed to be the more efficient procedure 
  of concentrating responsibility in a single pastor or overseer, and the committee 
  of elders was reduced to the status of an advisory council.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The itinerants often presented something of a problem to the 
  established communities. In time some of them became suspected of abusing their 
  ministerial office. The apostle Paul suggested that true prophets and teachers 
  could be distinguished in part by the evidence they gave of possessing <i>the 
  fruits of the Spirit</i>. The <i>Didache</i> was even more explicit when it 
  suggested that, if the preaching or prophesying of an itinerant ended in a demand 
  for food or money by way of reward <font size="3">(does this still sound familiar 
  in our time?)</font> he was to be cast out as a deceiver. The problem posed 
  by the itinerants was ultimately solved by having the bishop or pastor gradually 
  extend his responsibilities to include those of the ministerial office, thus 
  largely displacing the itinerants in the life of the church. <font size="3">(It 
  must also be realized that as all of these organizational adjustments and changes 
  were taking place in the life of the church, the mysteries that were committed 
  to the Church for safekeeping were also slipping into the mist. The individual 
  congregations had the books but no longer knew exactly how to interpret them. 
  They were sealed. The wise, of course, understood this...Isaiah 29:11)</font>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">At the same time that the bishop was assuming the duties of 
  the minister, his responsibilities were also undergoing geographical extension. 
  In various important centers the Christian community had enjoyed marked growth 
  and had become too large to meet in one place. Thus it became necessary for 
  the community to divide itself into several distinct congregations meeting in 
  different parts of the city. The bishop or the pastor remained as head of the 
  whole enterprise but presbyters were assigned to take charge of the individual 
  assemblies. And when missionary activity extended into the neighboring rural 
  areas creating Christian groups there, these too were brought under his supervision.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. <i>The Church Invokes Apostolic Authority</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Christian communities were increasingly troubled by controversy 
  as the years went by. Strange and novel prophetic revelations led to different 
  interpretations of the person and the work of Christ <font size="3">(as well 
  they should have)</font>, and of the nature of the life to which the Christians 
  had been called. Thus the gospel seemed in danger of being corrupted and perverted, 
  and the whole movement was threatened with disintegration. To meet this danger, 
  an appeal was made to the apostolic witness as the source of the normative tradition 
  of the church. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">After the death of the apostles, many writings had appeared, 
  designed to provide the church with authoritative instruction. As was to be 
  expected, the theological speculation and creative imagination which had led 
  to the controversy was reflected in this literature. Thus the conflict between 
  the new teachings of those who claimed direct revelations by the Spirit and 
  the long-familiar traditions of the church was heightened... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><font size="3">(In essence a Gnostic movement was growing out 
  of the original &quot;gnostic&quot; and &quot;kabbalistic&quot;character of 
  the church itself. Those who were becoming more increasingly concerned for order 
  and for structural and doctrinal integrity within the church--for &quot;the 
  orthodox tradition&quot; as it were--became increasingly at odds with those 
  who held that the orthodox themselves did not know what the tradition handed 
  down to them implied. That in order for the church to remain vibrant and fully 
  alive in the midst of such great Darkness that its doctrines required </font><font size="+1"><font size="3">not 
  only constant attendance, but also</font></font><font size="3"> constant interpretation, 
  and that its adherents must always be renewing themselves in the &quot;knowledge&quot; 
  of Christ. To many of the Gnostics--regardless of how close or far they were 
  to the actual hidden meanings of the Gospels--the church was not some new planting 
  in the earth, to be tended by a self-selected few. It was a great Tree whose 
  roots were already planted deep in the historical and spiritual consciousness 
  of the entire human family. To the orthodox this view could have no other effect 
  than to lead the Church back into the <i>paganism</i> of the past. The two streams 
  ran current and cross-current with each other until the ultimate victory of 
  the orthodox view and the rise of monolithic Christianity in the fourth century--the 
  State Church. This! said the religious dissidents in every age, was the very 
  error that the precepts of the early church inveighed against from the beginning)</font>. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">...To provide a dependable check against novel doctrines, the 
  principle was seized upon of limiting authoritive teachings to those writings 
  which most clearly could be regarded as being derived from the apostles. As 
  <i>eyewitness</i> to the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, the apostles 
  provided the only reliable historical evidence concerning the divine disclosure. 
  Their teachings, therefore, was the only trustworthy authority for the church. 
  It was the touchstone by which the true could be detected from the false. All 
  else which claimed the authority of the Spirit must be tested against the teachings 
  of the apostles. <font size="3">(</font></font>In essence each was a check on 
  the other.<font size="+1"><font size="3"> To those in the gnostic tradition, 
  every generation is an &quot;eyewitness&quot; to the life, death, and ultimate 
  resurrection of Christ, as Paul wrote: <i>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them 
  that are perfect...</i>1 Corinthians, chapter 2, and, <i>That the God of our 
  Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom 
  and revelation in the knowledge of him. The eyes of your understanding being 
  enlightened...</i>Ephesians 4:17-23)</font>. While there continued to be differences 
  of opinion among the scattered Christian communities with regard to a few of 
  the books which were ultimately included in the New Testament canon there was 
  a remarkable degree of unanimity with regard to most of the writings which were 
  judged to be apostolic and thus the source of the normative tradition. <font size="3">(Four 
  primary gospels were eventually agreed upon, out of the many others in circulation, 
  along with a central Book of Acts--whether by osmosis or by some convention--to 
  conform to the structure of the Five Books of the Torah and the Mystery of Christ 
  on the World Tree)</font>...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg321a.gif" width="297" height="162"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> ...When one compares the writings which were rejected with 
  those that were accepted, it is impossible not to be impressed by the sound 
  historical discrimination and judgment that was displayed in the selection made. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. <i>The Seed of the Church</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">During the years when the Christian communities were ordering 
  the outward form of their common life and seeking stability by an appeal to 
  the apostolic authority, they were living a precarious existence. Persecution 
  had begun with the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:58-60), and for three hundred 
  years the threat of mob violence or more drastic action by the state was to 
  hang over their heads.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It seems curious to us that the early Christians should have 
  been persecuted--whipped, stoned, cast to lions, condemned to the stake--for 
  by our standards they seem to have been inoffensive enough. The sum of their 
  offense was that they were different. They were living in the world and for 
  the world, but they were not of the world. Their ultimate loyalty was elsewhere.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Because the Christians were different, vicious rumors circulated 
  concerning them. What dark <font size="3">(Tantric)</font> deeds were thought 
  to take place behind the closed doors of their <i>love feasts</i>. Because Christians 
  were different, it was easy to make them the scapegoats for every disaster that 
  occurred. <font size="3">(Of course many of them were also prophesying these 
  disasters)</font>. Whenever there was flood or drought, famine or pestilence, 
  the cry would be raised, &quot;The Christians to the lions.&quot; Because the 
  Christians were different <font size="3">(because they were actually walking 
  in the very precepts handed down to them from the time of the apostles)</font>, 
  homes were disrupted and family ties were broken. The greatest offense of the 
  Christians, however, was that THEY WOULD NOT WORSHIP THE GODS UPON WHOSE WELFARE 
  THE STATE WAS THOUGHT TO DEPEND. NOR WOULD THEY ACKNOWLEDGE <a href="GiveUntoCaesar.htm">CAESAR</a> 
  AS LORD. They made clear again and again that there loyalty was always and only 
  to Christ. It was a loyalty that overrode all other claims of the community 
  upon them. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">STUBBORN AND OBSTINATE IN THEIR REFUSAL TO PERFORM THE RITES 
  OF WHICH THE SAFETY, SECURITY, AND PROSPERITY OF THE STATE WERE THOUGHT TO DEPEND, 
  THE CHRISTIANS COULD ONLY BE REGARDED AS TRAITORS TO SOCIETY, worthy of the 
  martyrdom to which they were condemned. Some were slaves, some were inconspicuous 
  folks, some were distinguished leaders of the church. How many there were, no 
  one knows. But there were many who withstood the temptation to deny their Lord...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning 
    of our confidence stedfast unto the end...</font></i><font size="+1">(Hebrews 
    3:14)</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall 
    be saved...</i>(Matthew 24:13)<i>.</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Was martyrdom necessary? No one can answer that question except 
  for himself when it is his own life that is at stake (Leviticus 1:2,3). It is 
  only in the agony of one's own soul that a Christian determines what the decision 
  for Christ and his kingdom must be. But a Christian must be different, and the 
  Christian society, which is the Church, must be different. And because this 
  is so, the Church must expect the recurrent hostility of those with whom it 
  can not finally make a compromise. This much is clear: the Christian church 
  during its days of martyrdom could be neither defeated or suppressed. The gates 
  of hell could not prevail against it. The very blood of the martyrs became the 
  seed of the Church.</font><i><font size="+1"> </font></i>(These were the Morning

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">One of the &quot;most profound revolutions&quot; which has 
  occurred &quot;in the entire history of the church,&quot; W.E. Garrison has 
  declared, was the transformation of the church, in the fourth century, from 
  &quot;a voluntary society having in its membership only those who were members 
  by their own choice,&quot; to &quot;a society conceived as necessarily coextensive 
  with the civil community and endowed with power to enforce the adherence of 
  all members of the civil community.&quot; The following discussion attempts 
  to make clear the consequences of this revolution in the life of the church.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For three hundred years Christians lived in danger of mob violence, 
  and toward the end of this period mob action and local persecution had been 
  replaced by a concerted effort to destroy the Christian movement as a whole. 
  Then, with dramatic suddenness, the precarious position of the Christian communities 
  within the Roman Empire was brought to an end. Almost overnight Christianity 
  emerged from its status as an illegal faith into the role of being the favored 
  and then the official religion of the Empire. <font size="3">(Understand Ezekiel, 
  chapter 16; Revelation 17)</font>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Emperor Constantine had acted on the basis of the old political 
  maxim--&quot;if you can't beat them, join them.&quot; The policy of persecution 
  had failed. Far from being suppressed, the Christian communities had spread 
  and multiplied. Other emperors had sought to make the empire strong by destroying 
  the Christian communities. Constantine, finding himself in a difficult situation, 
  tried the opposite policy. He decided that his position might be strengthened 
  by enlisting the Christian God in his service. </font><font size="+1">The gamble 
  paid off <font size="3">(We think not. It resulted in the world wars of the 
  20th century, and now in the age-ending war of our time)</font>, his opponents 
  were defeated, and in anticipation of further benefits to be derived from the 
  Christian God, Constantine took the church under his protection, showered it 
  with favors, and assumed responsibility for directing its affairs. <font size="3">(Please 
  see Isaiah 30:1,2)</font>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">1<i>. Triumph or</i> <i>DEFEAT</i>?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Constantine's conversion to Christianity has frequently been 
  interpreted as a triumph for the church. <font size="3">(It was instead the 
  beginning of the <i>foreordained </i>downfall of Christianity itself)</font>. 
  It is true that Christianity's new status in society did represent at least 
  one definite gain. Persecution is not a blessing, and the individual Christian 
  could now profess his faith openly and without fear. He could meet freely with 
  his fellow Christians for purpose of worship. Imperial favor and patronage represent 
  more dubious gains. The churches were relieved of certain taxes, ecclesiastical 
  courts were recognized, the clergy were exempted from municipal obligations, 
  and grain was given them to distribute to the poor. (Sound recently familiar)? 
  Public funds were were appropriated to build new houses of worship, and the 
  treasures of pagan temples were transferred to them. The lament of Jerome that 
  &quot;the holy books of the Christians which once were given to the flames are 
  now bound in purple and inlaid with gold and jewels&quot; is one indication 
  of the dramatic shift in fortune which had taken place. From obscurity and peril, 
  the church had traveled the road to security, privilege, and favor...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">...There were other consequences flowing from imperial patronage 
  which suggest that the new position which Christianity had acquired was something 
  less than a full triumph. &quot;The extraordinary change by which Christianity, 
  instead of being the religion of the persecuted minority, became the religion

  to the character of Christianity than it did to the character of the world...The 
  disappointing thing is that when the change came about, the world went on very 
  much as before--the institutions of the state were the same, as was the behavior 
  of men in business and pleasure, slavery, wars.&quot; But the church did not 
  go on as before. The church was not the same. &quot;The church,&quot; as Kenneth 
  E. Kirk, former bishop of Oxford, observed, was &quot;all but completely assimilated 
  to the model of the world.&quot; </font>(Please realize that throughout all 
  of this emerging heresy, this unholy and adulterous marriage between church 
  and state, God had kept for Themselves a remnant. [see Matthew 19:11]. Throughout 
  every generation, and in every place, the light of the true faith continued 
  to burn--ever so dimly at times and as a bright burning blaze at others)<font size="+1">.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2. <i>The Declining Level of Christian Life</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One of the consequences of fateful future significance which 
  flowed from Constantine's conversion to Christianity was the vast increase in 
  the number of Christians. &quot;It was inevitable,&quot; comments John Baille, 
  &quot;that the majority of Romans would themselves desire to follow the emperor 
  in embracing the new faith...And where Rome led the rest of the Empire would 
  be likely to follow.&quot; The ambitious could easily see the political and 
  social advantage to be gained by accepting the emperor's religion, and those 
  who entertained no particular ambitions had long been accustomed to expressing 
  their loyalty to the emperor by worshipping the emperor's gods. Few among the 
  new adherents were more than nominal Christians and many were as pagan as ever 
  at heart. Thus the &quot;high visibility&quot; which had characterized the early 
  Christian communities was obscured and it became increasingly difficult to tell 
  the Christian from the non-Christian.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. <i>A Developing Trust in External Rites for Assurance of 
  Salvation</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The general decline in the level of life within the post-Constantinian 
  church accentuated the tendency to seek an external assurance of salvation. 
  The church could no longer pretend to be a fellowship of the redeemed--a new 
  society of men markedly different in character from the larger society about 
  it. The minimum standard of behavior which could be required of so heterogeneous 
  a company as now constituted the church was not sufficiently rigorous to cultivate 
  the illusion of spiritual security. In this situation, the only way by which 
  the necessity for personal repentance and humble submission in trust to God 
  could be evaded was to place one's reliance upon the efficacy of the rites of 
  the church to secure the blessings of heaven. </font><font size="3">(Of course, 
  for those walking in the light of the true faith this was not so. These, also 
  of course, would over time become the object of the authoritive wrath of the 
  now Holy and Apostolic Catholic Church)</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One curious phenomenon was the postponement of baptism until 
  the final moments of one's life--a custom which became a common practice <font size="3">(made 
  up for now in the just-as-meaningless rite of infant baptism, which cannot assure 
  the soul a place in the heavens above, only a place in the structure and character 
  of the Catholic Church--admittedly for good in many cases but for evil in so 
  many others)</font>. There were many who were not anxious to incur the apparent 
  risk involved in postbaptisimal sin. Following the example of Constantine <font size="3">(who 
  throughout his life, even throughout his Christian life, was a cold-blooded 
  murderer)</font>, they delayed their baptism until the moment death was at hand, 
  when there would be little opportunity to fall from grace. This was not an entirely 
  satisfactory solution to their problem, for they might either wait too long 
  to be baptized and be thwarted by a sudden death or unexpectedly recover from 
  what they thought to be a mortal illness and be exposed to the continuing temptation 
  of earthly existence. Ultimately an adjustment was made by introducing the sacrament 
  of penance to take care of postbaptismal sins and by the use of extreme unction 
  to prepare the soul for death. <font size="3">(The ultimate number of Sacraments, 
  Seven, eventually conformed to the completion of the Mystery here in the West--which 
  culminates in the fulfillment of the Sacrifice of the Mass itself)</font>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The mood which was reflected in the increasing dependence upon 
  the rites of the institution is not unlike that of some modern Protestants who 
  achieve what they believe to be real spiritual security by attending Sunday 
  morning worship regularly and making a generous pledge of support to the church 
  <font size="3">(see Matthew 7:21-27)</font>. It is a relationship to an institution 
  which constitutes for them the badge of a Christian. The men and women of an 
  earlier day were merely somewhat more imaginative in defining practices by which 
  their piety could be demonstrated and merit accumulated.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">4. <i>Clerical Office as a Bone of Contention</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A direct consequence of the reliance upon the rites and ceremonies 
  of the church was the creation of a sharp cleavage between the clergy and the 
  laity <font size="3">(a sin attributed to the Nicolaitans...Revelation 2:5,6)</font>. 
  During the fourth and fifth centuries, the laity increasingly became onlookers 
  rather than participants in the actual life of the church. The number of communicants 
  dwindled, and by the sixth century the custom of habitual communion had almost 
  disappeared. The service was performed for them rather than by them. The concept 
  of the church as a community of the faithful was fading and being replaced by 
  the concept of the church as a clerical institution.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The gap between the clergy and laity was further accentuated 
  by the privileges which Constantine and his successors bestowed upon the clergy. 
  In the early days, the men who presided in the communal acts of worship were 
  in ordinary life indistinguishable from other members of the Christian community. 
  For the most part they supported themselves by some secular employment. All 
  this was changed when the churches became wealthy and privileged institutions. 
  Regular salaries were assigned to the clergy from funds derived from confiscated 
  properties of pagan temples and from appropriations by the state. Immunities 
  of various sorts from burdens borne by ordinary men, which previously the pagan 
  priests had enjoyed, were conferred upon the Christian clergy. In addition, 
  the clergy were given certain disciplinary powers over the lives of the people, 
  and the sanctuary rights of pagan temples were extended to include the Christian 
  churches. Thus the clergy constituted a privileged, influential, and frequently 
  wealthy class in society, and a clerical career was to be coveted for reasons 
  quite divorced from any real religious concern. <font size="3">(Understand Hebrews 
  5:1-4)</font>. Disgraceful scenes of conflict and disorder not infrequently 
  accompanied an election to the more important posts within the church. Scarcely 
  more than fifty years after Constantine had issued the Edict of Milan, Ambrose 
  as governor of Milan thought it necessary to be present <i>with his troops</i> 
  at the election of the local bishop in order to preserve order and avoid bloodshed. 
  This was no unnecessary precaution, for only a few years earlier the election 
  of Damascus as bishop of the church in Rome had provoked a pitched battle between 
  the adherents of the <i>contending parties</i>, and before it was over a hundred 
  corpses littered the floor of the church. After Damascus had made good his election 
  by slaughter, the pagan prefect of the city is reported to have said to him: 
  &quot;Make me bishop of Rome, and I will turn Christian at once.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">5. <i>THE PERSECUTED BECOME THE PERSECUTORS</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus far the Christian church had simply been recognized as 
  a legal religion and had been the recipient of official patronage and favor. 
  It was but a short step, however, from official approval and patronage of one 
  religion to discrimination against other religions. Before the end of the fourth 
  century, the Emperor Theodosius had issued an edict which began with the words: 
  &quot;It is our desire and <i>will </i> that all peoples which are governed 
  by the moderation of our clemency should follow the religion which was given 
  to the Romans by St. Peter the Apostle.&quot; Christianity was now compulsory, 
  conversion was henceforth to be largely by the sword, and the persecuted were 
  to be the persecutors. </font>(Please follow this realization into the 20th 
  century, and then open up the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, one in the center 
  of Europe and the other here in America)<font size="+1">.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the exception of concessions which were ultimately to 
  be made to the Jews and Moslems, every member of society was henceforth required 
  to make a Christian profession. The non-Christian and even the unorthodox Christian 
  were to be outlaws, having no rights, living outside the protection of the laws, 
  and subject to immediate execution if apprehended. The ultimate identification 
  of the Christian society with the political has been described by Sir Ernest 
  Barker in these words: &quot;The excommunicated person could not enter either 
  the church or the law court; could not receive either the Eucharist or a legacy; 
  could not own either a cure of souls or an acre of soil.&quot; As J. N. Figgs 
  describes the fully developed system, there were no non-churchmen, or if there 
  were, they were occupied with being burnt.&quot; Christianity had become a faith 
  to be maintained and perpetuated by coercion, by the exercise of police power 
  and the utilization of the sword.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">6. <i>The Church loses Its Independence</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Perhaps the most serious consequence of Constantine's action 
  in assuming the role of protector and patron of the Christian`church was the 
  loss by the church of its freedom...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Corinthians 3:17)</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And when they were come to Capar'naum, they that received 
    tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus 
    prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of 
    the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus said unto him, 
    THEN ARE THE CHILDREN FREE?...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew 17:24-27).</font></p>

    made us free, AND BE NOT ENTANGLED AGAIN WITH THE YOKE OF BONDAGE...</font></i><font size="+1">(Galatians 
    5:1; Hebrews 6:3-6)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> ...&quot;As an emperor who without benefit of clergy or sacraments 
  had chosen to serve the Supreme Divinity whom the church professed to worship&quot;--to 
  use the vivid words of Shirley Jackson Case--Constantine &quot;felt no hesitation 
  of chiding schismatics, giving orders to clerics...or addressing the most august 
  Christian assemblies convened by his authority.&quot; Even though he had not 
  been baptised, Constantine assumed the right to call synods of the church and 
  to enforce their decisions, to intervene in the appointment of the clergy and 
  to serve as final judge of their actions. Nor did he hesitate to dismiss and 
  banish those who ran counter to the policy which he adopted for the church. 
  HENCEFORTH THE CHURCH WAS TO BE REGARDED AS AN ARM OF THE GOVERNMENT. This state 
  of affairs was to continue in the Eastern portion of the Empire until its collapse 
  on the eve of the Reformation, and it has been perpetuated to the present day 
  in some Eastern churches, and to various degrees in the Church of England and 
  the various Lutheran territorial churches. The most conspicuous modern illustration 
  of the unhappy consequence of this tradition are to be found in the events which 
  befell the church in Russia during the Revolution and in Germany under the Nazi 
  regime, but the control of the Church of England by Parliament, however benevolent 
  that control has been, has not been an altogether happy situation.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Christian church has had a strange odyssey, and one of 
  the most remarkable chapters in its history was the attempt to fashion an imperial 
  church to rule the world. The aim was to introduce order, peace, and unity into 
  a society that was badly disordered and plagued by constant strife. In the pursuit 
  of this goal, the church itself became infected by the evil which it sought 
  to cast out.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Kenneth Scott Latourette has characterized the period 500 to 
  1500 as &quot;the thousand years of uncertainty.&quot; It was a period of confusion, 
  when expressions of Christian faith and life were multiform and variegated, 
  when strife and conflict were endemic, when changes occurred so slowly as to 
  be imperceptible. One conspicuous feature of these ten centuries, however, was 
  an attempt to fashion an imperial church to replace the Empire, which had crumpled 
  in the West. As a result of its close connection with the Empire--with dioceses, 
  provinces, and an incipient tendency in some quarters of the West to centralize 
  authority in the hands of a singular ruler, the bishop of Rome.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1. <i>The Petrine Theory</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The preeminence of Rome among the churches of the West is easily 
  to be understood. Rome was the imperial capital, the Eternal City, the only 
  major city in the West; and the Roman church was the largest and wealthiest 
  church, with a reputation for orthodoxy and charity. In addition, while several 
  churches in the East could claim an apostolic foundation, this was true of Rome 
  alone in the West... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><font size="3">(The author has not taken into account here 
  the church established by the apostles in Britain, and in upper and Western 
  Europe, the <i>Keltic</i> church, which was not only not beholding to the greater 
  church at Rome until long after the timeof Patrick, and the legendary Arthurian 
  period, but until that time was more or less oblivious to its emerging heresies, 
  and upon initial contact its enemy. The two eventually found common ground, 
  but only in places far away from the Imperial court at Rome. The <i>Keltic</i> 
  church did not support or subscribe to the Petrine Theory)</font>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">...As the back-country churches of colonial Massachusetts and 
  even the Presbyterian churches of colonial New Jersey frequently appealed to 
  the ministers of Boston for counsel and advice in their controversies, so the 
  churches of an earlier day often looked to Rome for help in settling their differences. 
  <font size="3">(Not the back-country <i>Keltic</i> churches, who only went to 
  Rome to defend themselves from Rome's decrees themselves. Nor has the author 
  accounted for the forms of Christianity that were being established in Africa, 
  India and as far away as America)</font>. But even men like Irenaeus and Cyprian, 
  who supported the leadership in Rome in the defense of orthodoxy did not hesitate 
  to dissent when they felt that Rome was in error. <font size="+1">The bishops 
  of Rome, on the other hand, tended to feel that they had peculiar prerogatives 
  which ought not to be slighted.</font> <font size="3">(Irenaeus, from Gaul, 
  was much closer geographically to those independent and &quot;druid-like&quot; 
  dissidents to the West, an independence which afterwards had virtually faded 
  out of existence, no doubt for expedience' sake, through concession and comprimise. 
  Where the comprimises would not be made, the dissidents were eventually driven 
  out of existence militarily by the now Roman/Catholic forces)</font>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To support the Roman pretensions Leo I, in the middle of the 
  fifth century, developed a theory of Petrine succession based upon the text: 
  <i>Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church</i>. (Matt.16:18). 
  The theory was that Peter was the prince of the apostles <font size="3">(Prince? 
  Peter was a hippie-Buddhist-Hasidic-Franciscan-Jew, an Essene)</font>, to whom 
  had been given authority over the other apostles and the church </font><font size="+1">that 
  Peter was the first bishop of Rome, and that his authority had been transmitted 
  to succeeding bishops of Rome. This was not a succession of persons, as was 
  true of the theory of apostolic succession, but a succession in office. The 
  authority was not conveyed from one occupant of the office to another by the 
  laying on of hands, for an interval always occurred between the death of a bishop 
  of Rome and the election of his successor. <font size="3">(See it in the Dark 
  Crystal)</font></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There were several difficulties in making use of this text 
  for such a purpose. First, Peter had just confessed his conviction that Jesus 
  (the Druid HESUS) was the messiah, and the majority of the church fathers were 
  in agreement that the <i>rock</i> upon which the Church was established was 
  not Peter but the conviction he had expressed. Second, the Gospels make it clear 
  that preeminence among the followers of Christ was not to be after the pattern 
  of the princes of the world who exercise lordship and authority, but in terms 
  of humble service (1 Corinthians 2:1-8, KJV)...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The rulers of the Gentiles exercise authority over them...IT 
    SHALL NOT BE SO AMONG YOU...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew 20:25-29)<i>.</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>There is a time when one man ruleth over another to his 
    own hurt...</i>(Ecclesiastes 8:9).</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> Third, Peter continued to be notoriously unstable </font>(for 
  all didactic purposes)<font size="+1">, being immediately rebuked by Jesus and 
  called Satan for not understanding <i>the things that be of God</i>, denying 
  his Lord in the moment of crisis...and being criticized by Paul as an unreliable 
  disciple. Fourth, the theory assumes that the grant of authority was not to 
  Peter but to his office as bishop of Rome, but this identification of authority 
  with a particular office is nowhere to be found in the text. Lastly, assuming 
  that Peter was given authority over the rest of the disciples, there is not 
  a single basis for the notion that this power was to be transmitted to anyone 
  else. (When in fact it was James, and not Peter, who was chosen as leader of 
  the community--and to preside from Jerusalem nor Rome <i><font size="3">(Again,

<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/dragon.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p><font size="+1">The oldest churches in Christendom, of course, were in the 
  East </font>(the author unknowingly says)<font size="+1">, and there was never 
  to be any acknowledgment among them of any superior authority to be exercised 
  by the bishop of Rome, and when the imperial capital was transferred to Constantinople 
  even the customary precedence in honor which had been accorded to the Roman 
  church was to be challenged by the church in New Rome. <font size="3">(Moscow 
  was later to be called The Third Rome)</font>. Furthermore, in northern Europe, 
  the non-Roman Christianity of Ireland was to be the vital and dynamic force 
  in the conversion of the northern peoples. Only slowly over the centuries did 
  the Roman church establish itself in Western Europe as the symbol of orthodoxy 
  which enjoyed a primacy of esteem and a presidency of honor. <font size="3">(Only 
  after it attached itself to the powerful and pervasive force of the Roman Empire, 
  and eventually to the Holy Roman Empire to which it became its unholy consort...Revelation, 
  chapter 17)</font>. It was one thing to be in communion with Rome as the Anglican 
  churches are today in communion with Canterbury; it was quite another matter 
  to acknowledge Rome's superiority in jurisdiction. There was always a gap between 
  the role which Rome claimed for itself and the authority which others were willing 
  to acknowledge, and kings and princes were usually careful to safeguard the 
  prerogatives of their own bishops. On occasion, of course, bargains were struck 
  which were mutually advantageous.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">2 <i>The Struggle for Independence</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Christian church has never felt completely at ease in a 
  subservient status to the state, and this was especially true of the church 
  at Rome. During the century following Constantine's death, the disintegration 
  of the imperial authority in Italy gave the church an opportunity to assert 
  its independence. The earliest resistance to the imperial control was led by 
  Ambrose, bishop of Milan, at the close of the fourth century. In the sixth century, 
  Gregory the Great <font size="3">(ahem!)</font> succeeded in putting together 
  a papal kingdom in the central portion of the Italian peninsula. <font size="3">(Enter 
  the reign of the Philistines)</font>. Elsewhere in western Europe, the new chieftains 
  and kings took bishops into their courts as officers of the state, and this 
  status tended to be universalized when Charlemagne assumed the role of Constantine 
  in a resurrected Roman Empire. It was not until the eleventh century that Hildebrand 
  hammered out the theory and to a degree the fact of the independence of what 
  by now had become the papal church. Even so, the notion that the bishop was 
  the king's man did not completely disappear, and councils of the church continued 
  to be called and presided over by kings and not by churchmen.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hildebrand had come to power at the end of one of the most 
  disastrous epochs in the history of the papal church. <font size="3">(By now 
  the reader must be fully informed that this is not the church that Christ established, 
  what, with all its division and confusion, and complete ignorance of its own 
  mysteries, but the church that the spirit of Antichrist was establishing in 
  the earth. The church at Rome created a Corporate structure of itself and arrogated 
  to itself the authority and the instructions of Christ that pertain to individual 
  believers alone)</font>. There had been ten bishops of Rome in the last decade 
  of the ninth century. One of them had been strangled after he had dug up the 
  corpse of his predecessor, stripped of its pontifical garments, and ordered 
  the body thrown in the Tiber. It was a time when petty local tyrants made and 
  unmade popes at will. The first half of the eleventh century witnessed the scandalous 
  rule of Benedict IX. Benedict had been consecrated bishop of Rome as a child 
  of ten or twelve years, and lived to behave like one of the most monstrous of 
  the pagan emperors. He achieved the difficult feat of equaling the disgraceful 
  record of two or three of the popes in the period immediately preceding the 
  Reformation. In 1046, having tired of his papal office, Benedict put it up for 
  sale. The purchaser, who took the name of Gregory VI, sought to effect some 
  reforms, whereupon Benedict's family rebelled and reinstated Benedict in the 
  Holy Office. Another faction had installed Sylvester III, so that there were 
  three claimants to the papal honors. In response to an appeal to put an end 
  to this disgraceful state of affairs, the Emperor Henry III intervened. Sylvester 
  was imprisoned, Benedict's resignation was accepted, and Gregory VI was deposed 
  and exiled. Henry insisted that only a foreign pope, protected by the emperor, 
  could avoid the factional quarrels among the Roman populace which had debased 
  the papacy. The next six popes were to be Germans, nominees of the emperor. 
  They were able men, but none of them lived very long. The most distinguished 
  was Leo IX, under whom Hildebrand became an influential figure...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">3. <i>&quot;The Intoxication of Victory&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Independence was not all that Hildebrand sought. Arnold Toynbee 
  suggests that he became intoxicated by his success in winning the independence 
  of the church and was led to overreach himself and claim the imperial power 
  itself for the church. Others suggest that the course Hildebrand pursued was 
  merely due to the fact that the church had lived too long in intimate association 
  with the state to be content with its freedom alone.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This much is clear: the church in Rome had become infected 
  by the imperial spirit and it longed for political power to fulfill its own 
  imperial destiny. Thus not only did Hildebrand seek the freedom of the church 
  to control its own life; he desired above all else that it should be supreme 
  in political affairs as well. &quot;The pope alone,&quot; he declared, &quot;may 
  use the imperial insignia; all persons shall kiss the foot of the pope alone; 
  the pope has power to depose emperors; his decree can be annulled by no one; 
  he can annul the decrees of anyone; he can be judged by no one.&quot; &quot;If 
  a man consider the original of this great ecclesiastical dominion,&quot; said 
  Thomas Hobbes, &quot;he will easily perceive that the papacy is no other than 
  the host of the deceased Roman Empire, sitting crowned upon the grave thereof. 
  For so did the papacy start up on a sudden out of the ruins of that heathen 
  power.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The actual temporal power exercised by Hildebrand and his successors 
  has been greatly exaggerated. Rulers acquiesced to papal decrees when it was 
  to their own advantage to do so, and ignored them when it was not. <font size="3">(Likewise, 
  the leaders of the world generally ignore the decrees and empty pontifications 
  of the present Pope John Paul II--his empty appeals for peace--while paying 
  him honor as a historical figure at the same time. And this is exactly what 
  the Lord of heaven and Earth would have us to see. The papal office has almost 
  no effect on the amount of good that is accomplished in the earth in the name 
  of Christ, but rather, in its unholy alignment with the nations of the earth, 
  with the vast amount of evil that is being accomplished in the world in the 
  name of Christ. Quite unconsciously, but nevertheless, by acting out the Catholic 
  church's historic marraige--its entanglement--with the temporal powers of the 
  earth, the present pope is helping to lead them all to the great battle of Armageddon)</font>. 
  Thus William the Conqueror was easily persuaded to invade England with the papal 
  blessing when Hildebrand wished to get rid of the archbishop of Canterbury. 
  But, once having seized the English crown for himself <font size="3">(a crown 
  which still sits upon the imperious heads of Elizabeth and the present succession

  MEET AT VATICAN</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ASSOCIATED PRESS__Pope John 
    Paul and Queen Elizabeth shared their hopes for progress in Christian unity 
    during her first visit to the Vatican in 20 years.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two shook hands warmly as John 
    Paul greeted the queen at the entrance to his private library for her 20-minute 
    audience, a highlight of her four-day visit to Italy. The queen's husband, 
    Prince Phillip, the Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied her.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;A great pleasure to see you 
    again,&quot; Elizabeth said, as both recalled that their last meeting was 
    at Buckingham Palace in 1982. Both had prepared speeches, but rather than 
    read them, they handed each other the texts. (how merciful).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The queen emphasized progress made 
    toward peace in Northern Ireland in the conflict involving Catholics and Protestants. 
    &quot;We are most grateful for your help and support for this process,&quot; 
    she told the Pope. (He graciously accepted).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The queen is temporal head of the 
    Church of England, which had expressed concern over a document the Vatican 
    issued last month that stressed the primacy of the Catholic Church among Christian 
    communities. </font>(After all these centuries it is still at it)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The queen's speech, however, emphasized progress made in recent years. &quot;I 
    trust we shall continue along the path which leads to Christian unity,&quot; 
    the speech said. For his part, John Paul assured the queen in his prepared 
    remarks that &quot;there can be no turning back from the ecumenical goal.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He also had words of praise for 
    the queen: &quot;For many years now, and through times of great change, you 
    have reigned with a dignity and sense of duty which have edified millions 
    of people around the world.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">England broke from the Catholic 
    Church under King Henry VIII in the 16th century. British monarchs have paid 
    visits to Popes since Edward VII in 1903.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...William refused to do homage for it to the pope, installed 
  his own men as bishops, refused to permit them to make any appeals to Rome without 
  his consent, and would not allow any papal bull or letter to be received in 
  England or any other papal legate to be admitted without his approval. On those 
  occasions when a temporal ruler seemed to knuckle under to the papal will, it 
  was often the result of more compelling pressures than papal displeasure. King 
  John surrendered England to Innocent III and received it back as a fief in a 
  desperate effort to save himself from the consequences of his own folly in alienating 
  all possible support. The gamble, however, was unsuccessful, for he was forced 
  to come to terms with the barons and signed the Magna Carta at Runnymede in 
  1215. Nor could Innocent help him by declaring the Great Charter null and void. 
  The papal decree was flouted, excommunications were ignored, and the Charter 
  became the symbol of English liberties. Even the Emperor Henry IV, who humbled 
  himself before Hildebrand at Canossa, was not tamed, and it was Hildebrand who 
  died in exile.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While the papacy had difficulty making good its claims, it 
  paid a stiff price for the attempt. In its endeavor to establish political authority 
  over the peoples of Europe, the papal monarchy transformed itself into the image 
  of its adversaries. Like the empire that it sought to replace, the papacy engaged 
  in diplomatic intrigue, maintained armies, and fought wars to achieve its ends. 
  The popes became secular princes, living in ostentatious splendor and frequently 
  spending as much as two-thirds of the income of the Holy See on their military 
  budgets. The early christians, James H. Nichols has commented, were willing 
  to die rather than burn incense to Caesar; now much more than incense was being 
  sacrificed to Caesarism. Those, like the Spiritual Franciscans among whom evangelical 
  faith had been awakened by hearing the gospel, were often condemned to the stake 
  or slain by the sword. For reasons Constantine would readily understand, Nichols 
  has commented, the new papal Caesardom shed--according to the estimates of the 
  historian Lecky--&quot;more innocent blood than any other institution in human 
  history.&quot;</font></p>

  OF HOPE</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By BBC News Online's 
  Peter Gould in Assisi</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judged as a spectacle, the Pope's 
    day of prayer for world peace was certainly impressive. Two hundred religious 
    leaders from around the world followed John Paul II into the pilgrimage town 
    of Assisi. Walking side by side and exchanging greetings were patriarchs and 
    imams, monks and rabbis. There were robes of every style and colour, and an 
    eye-catching array of clerical headwear. The watching crowds, largely Italian, 
    responded with cheers and prolonged applause as the Pope welcomed his guests, 
    and urged them to join his quest for peace.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what impact will his initiative 
    have on the streets of the world, among those who engage in violence against 
    those other faiths? Symbolic gestures do not usually persuade such people 
    to lay down their weapons. But the Pope knows that creating a better understanding 
    between the world's religions, after centuries of mistrust and hostility, 
    HAS TO START AT THE TOP.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He has been clearly alarmed by 
    the events of September 11 and distressed by the latest upsurge of violence 
    IN THE HOLY LAND. He wants to create a climate of religious tolerance that 
    makes it difficult for extremists to justify violence by referring to their 
    faith. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Tragic conflicts often result 
    from an unjustified association of religion with nationalistic, political 
    and economic interests,&quot; the Pope told his audience. &quot;It is essential 
    that religious people and communities should in the clearest and most radical 
    way repudiate violence, starting with the violence that seeks to cloth itself 
    in religion. THERE IS NO RELIGIOUS GOAL WHICH CAN POSSIBLY JUSTIFY THE USE 
    OF VIOLENCE BY MAN AGAINST MAN.&quot;</font></p>

    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VATICAN CITY - Pope John Paul I</font>I 
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">said yesterday that violence in 
    God's name was never justified and that a ''cry of blood'' in the Holy Land 
    must persuade Christians, Muslims, and Jews to seek peace.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking on the Roman Catholic 
    Church's World Day of Peace, the pontiff said ''perverse interests'' threatened 
    to turn the world into a ''theater of war.'' ''Throughout the world a piercing 
    cry invoking peace rings out,'' he said in a sermon in Saint Peter's Basilica.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Paul said the Sept. 11 attacks 
    on the United States had shaken the world. He condemned the use of violence 
    in the name of God, but urged people not to fall prey to despair. ''No one, 
    for any reason, can kill in the name of God,'' he told the packed congregation 
    in an impassioned address.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">''However humanly difficult it 
    may seem to look toward the future with optimism, we must not give in to the 
    temptation to be discouraged,'' he said. ''On the contrary, we must work toward 
    peace with courage, confident that evil will not prevail.'' He called on monotheistic 
    religions to condemn the use of violence and said Christians, Muslims, and 
    Jews must restore peace to the Holy Land. ''The cry of blood calls to God 
    from that land, the blood of brothers spilt by brothers, all sons of the same 
    Patriarch Abraham, sons, as are all men, of the same Holy Father.''</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the Mass he told a crowd 
    gathered in Saint Peter's Square for his regular noon address that, even in 
    tormented periods of history, ''we must respond with the logic of love and 
    justice to those negative forces, guided by perverse interests which seek 
    to transform the world into a theater of war.'' He did not elaborate on what 
    he meant by ''perverse interests.''</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The message that there can be no 
    peace without justice and no justice without forgiveness was the theme of 
    this year's World Day of Peace.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ON DEC.11 THE POPE SAID THAT SELF 
    DEFENSE AGAINST TERRORIST ATTACKS WAS LEGITIMATE, but that the offended parties 
    had to be careful to single out for blame the individuals responsible rather 
    than entire groups or religions. </font>(And herein lies the crux of the whole 
    matter. How is it that the supposed high priest and interpreter of the Christian
