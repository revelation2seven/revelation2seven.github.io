  The designation &quot;Hebrew language&quot; for the language in which are written 
  the Old Testament (with the exception of Ezra iv. 8-vi. 18; Dan. ii. 4 [after 
  the fourth word]-vii. 38; Jer. x. 11; and a proper name in Gen. xxxi. 47), part 
  of the Apocryphal and pseudepigraphic writings, and the greatest part of later 
  Jewish literature, is first found in Hellenistic literature (Prologue to Ecclesiasticus 
  [Sirach]; Josephus, &quot;Ant.&quot; i. 1, &sect; 2; Rev. ix. 11). The same 
  designation is frequently used by Hellenistic authors to denote the Aramaic 
  language spoken at a later time by the &quot;Hebrews,&quot; as the Jews were 
  called by non-Jewish writers. In Hebrew literature the term is first met in 
  the Mishnah (Yad. v. 4; Gi?, ix. 8); Biblical writers use the expression &quot;the 
  language of Canaan&quot; (Isa. xix. 18) or &quot;the Jews' language&quot; (II 
  Kings xviii. 26, 28; comp. Isa. xxxvi. 11, 13; Neh. xiii. 24; comp. also the 
  modern use of &quot;Yiddish&quot;). More frequently, however, the language is 
  called in later Jewish literature &quot;the Holy Tongue,&quot; to distinguish 
  it from the Aramaic vernacular or other &quot;profane languages&quot; spoken 
  in later times by the Jews (Targ. Yer. to Gen. xxxi. 11; So?ah vii. 11). This 
  designation seems to be an abbreviation of &quot;lishan bet ?udsha&quot; = &quot;the 
  language of the sanctuary&quot; (Targ. pseudo-Jonathan to Gen. xxxi. 47). The 
  Assyrians called Hebrew &quot;the language of the west country&quot; (comp. 
  Hastings, &quot;Dict. Bible,&quot; iii. 25).</p>
<p>The Hebrew language might be appropriately called the Israelitish dialect of 
  Canaanitish, a branch of the Semitic Languages spoken in Palestine and in the 
  Phenician colonies. Almost identical with it is Moabitish, as seen in the stele 
  of Mesha (See Moabite Stone). Closely akin to it was Phenician, and in all probability 
  also the languages of Ammon, Edom, and Philistia. The language used in the Zenjirli 
  inscriptions approaches Hebrew closely.</p>
<p>Relationship and Characteristics.</p>
<p>Phonetically Hebrew occupies a middle place between Arabic, on the one hand, 
  and Aramaic, on the other. Of the original Semitic consonants some appear to 
  have been wholly or partly lost; at least the distinction between certain related 
  but different sounds is not indicated in writing. Thus there is only one character 
  in Hebrew (?) for the Arabic &quot;?a&quot; and &quot;kha,&quot; only one (?) 
  for the Arabic &quot;'ain&quot; and &quot;ghain&quot; (though from transcriptions 
  of proper names in the Septuagint it seems that, like Arabic, it once had the 
  two ? sounds), only one (?) for the Arabic &quot;?ad&quot; and &quot;?ad,&quot; 
  and only one (?) for the Arabic &quot;?a&quot; and &quot;?a.&quot; Like Aramaic, 
  Hebrew has a double pronunciation of the letters &#151;explosive and spirant. 
  Like Arabic, it has a double sound of ? (comp. Merx, &quot;Zeitschrift f&uuml;r 
  Assyriologie,&quot; xiv. 308). From the ? at the end of the alphabet in certain 
  alphabetic compositions in the Old Testament some assume the existence of the 
  emphatic &quot;p&quot; known in Syriac and Ethiopic. Initial radical ?, as in 
  Aramaic, has largely passed into ?. AlthoughHebrew has lost some of the original 
  vowels still retained in classical Arabic, that loss has not assumed such proportions 
  as in the case of Aramaic. This is due chiefly to the retention in Hebrew of 
  the pretonic &quot;a&quot; vowel (see Shewa). Of case-endings, entirely lost 
  in Aramaic, Hebrew has preserved some remnants, although these have become meaningless.</p>
<p>The passive verb-forms, produced by internal vowel-change, only remnants of 
  which are preserved in the oldest Aramaic, are still full of life in Hebrew. 
  An exception to this is found only in the passive of the first conjugation, 
  which has been largely replaced by a reflexive form. Similarly, in the case 
  of the formation of a jussive mode, Hebrew holds an intermediate position between 
  Aramaic and Arabic. Hebrew has in common with Arabic a prefixal definite article 
  and an inseparable interrogative particle.</p>
<p>Hebrew Syntax and Vocabulary.</p>
<p>Syntactically, Biblical Hebrew remained in a very primitive stage, lacking 
  long and artificially constructed periods. The sentences are short and are connected 
  with one another by the conjunction &quot;and,&quot; which particle has various 
  logical meanings. This frequent use of &quot;and&quot; has, however, also developed 
  in Hebrew some very fine and expressive forms of construction, which, though 
  occurring here and there also in cognate dialects, have found their highest 
  development in Hebrew. One of these is the peculiar consecutive use of &quot;and&quot; 
  to connect a series of clauses with an initial clause, which latter defines 
  them temporally. On the whole, the particles in Biblical Hebrew are little developed 
  and frequently ambiguous. In later Hebrew this fault has to a large extent been 
  remedied. As in all Semitic languages, the concrete meanings of the word-stems 
  are more or less apparent and present in the consciousness of the speaker or 
  writer in all the derived word-forms. Hebrew, moreover, admits of almost no 
  compounds, except in proper names. There is a great lack of adjectives and adverbs, 
  especially of the latter; and the so-called tenses are rather modalities of 
  action. All these facts make Hebrew, indeed, a vehicle for narration of great 
  vividness, expressiveness, and beauty, and cause it as a language of poetry, 
  especially of religious poetry, to stand unsurpassed. On the other hand, it 
  is, at least in its Biblical form, ill adapted for the expression of abstract 
  ideas and involved philosophical thought&#151;a deficiency but partially overcome 
  by medieval writers by the invention of abstract terms and adjectival and adverbial 
  forms.</p>
<p>Origin.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages it was a prevailing opinion that Hebrew was the primitive 
  speech of mankind. This view was based on &quot;etymologies and other data in 
  the early chapters of Genesis [comp. Berliner, &quot;Beitr&auml;ge zur Hebr&auml;ischen 
  Grammatik,&quot; p. 9; K&ouml;nig, &quot;Hebr&auml;isch und Semitisch,&quot; 
  pp. 113 et seq.], which, however, were as plausibly turned by Syriac writers 
  in favor of their own tongue&quot; (&quot;Encyc. Bibl.&quot; ii. 1987; comp. 
  Audo, &quot;Syriac Dict.&quot; Preface). A similar opinion was expressed by 
  Rab (Sanh. 38b). Medieval Jewish scholars considered Arabic and Aramaic, the 
  only cognate languages known to them, as corruptions of Hebrew. In more recent 
  times, however, two opposing theories have been held. One, whose chief exponent 
  is S. D. Luzzatto, is that Hebrew is derived from Aramaic; the other, whose 
  chief exponent is Olshausen, is that it is derived from Arabic. D. S. Margoliouth 
  (&quot;Lines of Defense of Biblical Tradition,&quot; and &quot;Language of the 
  Old Testament,&quot; in Hastings, &quot;Dict. Bible,&quot; iii. 25 et seq.) 
  claims that Hebrew is nothing but a vulgar dialect of Arabic. Not only, however, 
  can the question concerning the relative age of a language whose origin lies 
  in prehistoric times not be answered positively, but the necessity of the question 
  itself is problematical: cognate languages may be parallel developments of one 
  mother tongue instead of being derived from one another. All that can be said 
  is, that by the testimony of the El-Amarna tablets (15th cent. B.C.), which 
  contain Canaanitish or Hebrew glosses, and by the evidence of Egyptian, which 
  contains Canaanitish loan-words borrowed some centuries before those tablets 
  were written, Canaanitish or Hebrew was spoken in Palestine as early as the 
  beginning of the second millennium B.C.</p>
<p>Language of the Patriarchs.</p>
<p>The other question, however, whether the Israelites brought their language 
  with them from their original home or adopted it after the conquest of Palestine, 
  as the Philistines seem to have done, is quite pertinent. From ?he facts that 
  Abraham was connected with Haran, that Jacob is called an Aramean (Deut. xxvi. 
  5), and that the language is designated as Canaanitish and, as mentioned above, 
  was spoken in Palestine centuries before the Exodus, one might assume, as some 
  scholars have done, that the Israelites' language in patriarchal times was Aramaic. 
  Hommel (&quot;The Ancient Hebrew Tradition&quot;) maintains that Aramaic is 
  a later development; that in patriarchal times Aramaic was but an Arabic dialect; 
  and that originally the Israelites spoke Arabic. From the fact, however, that 
  the Phenicians claimed to have come from the border of the Persian Gulf, where 
  Abraham also is said to have had his home, and from the fact that Assyro-Babylonian 
  is in both phonetics and vocabulary closely connected with Canaanitish, the 
  probability of the Israelites having brought their language along with them 
  is not to be denied.</p>
<p>Since Israel was a conglomeration of tribes, one expects to find their language 
  showing dialectic differences. Such differences are distinctly mentioned in 
  the case of the Ephraimites (Judges xii. 6), who could not pronounce ?. In some 
  books expressions occur which show perhaps local coloring, on the basis of which 
  some distinguish a Judaic and an Ephraitic dialect; others, an Ephraitic, a 
  Judaic, and a Simeonic dialect. But there is no certainty that such expressions 
  are not rather characteristics of the individual authors. Differences that may 
  have existed in the pronunciation of the various localities were obliterated 
  by a later leveling vocalization. That such obliteration has taken place in 
  some cases is apparent from the differences in the vocalization of proper names 
  existing between the Masoretic text and the Septuagint.</p>
<p>The literature of Hebrew covers a period of about3,000 ye?rs, from the earliest 
  documents of the Bible down to modern times. In so long a period the language 
  has naturally undergone many changes. One may reckon broadly two phases of linguistic 
  development: (1) the creative period, during the life of the language as the 
  people's speech, and (2) the reproductive period, during its life in literary 
  monuments only.</p>
<p>Biblical Hebrew.</p>
<p>The creative period of Hebrew may be divided into three phases: pre-exilic, 
  post-exilic, and Mishnaic (the justification for including the last-named phase 
  in this period is given below). The limited literature preserved in the Bible 
  and the nature of most of its books, which are the products of schools rather 
  than of individuals, as well as the uncertainty as to the time and place of 
  their composition, make the historical tracing of the development of Biblical 
  Hebrew a hazardous undertaking. In a general way it may be said that the language 
  underwent little change during the first commonwealth; but with the growth of 
  the arts and the development of professions and trade, new expressions had probably 
  to be coined and foreign words borrowed. Accordingly loan-words from Assyrian 
  and Egyptian, from the languages of India and Persia, and perhaps from Greek 
  are successively found. Whether such borrowing was done directly or through 
  the mediation of Phenician can not be ascertained positively. Direct borrowing 
  need be assumed only in the case of Aramaic loan-words. The Arameans were the 
  immediate neighbors of northern Israel from the very beginning. The foreign 
  settlers who were domiciled in Israel after the downfall of the kingdom of the 
  Ten Tribes probably also spoke Aramaic.</p>
<p>The correctness of the view that Aramaic was the international language of 
  anterior Asia as early as the eighth century B.C. is not certain (comp. A. Ehrlich's 
  commentary to II Kings xviii. 26), but there is no doubt that this was the fact 
  after the Babylonian exile. Gradually Aramaic gained predominance in the Persian 
  empire, displacing local forms of speech, and Hebrew, like other languages, 
  had to succumb to its influence and ceased to be spoken. As was to be expected 
  from such close relationship between the two languages, one borrowed from the 
  other during the entire period that Hebrew and later Aramaic were together alive 
  in Palestine. Even the oldest Biblical writings, as the Book of Judges, the 
  Elohistic document, and Isaiah, show Aramaisms (, etc.). It is interesting in 
  this connection to notice that the oldest Canaanitish inscription known, the 
  patera of Ba'al Lebanon, contains also an Aramaic loan-word ().</p>
<p>By the post-exilic writers pre-exilic literature seems to have been recognized 
  as already classic. Their language differs from that of the preceding period 
  in three respects: (1) there is conscious imitation of earlier works (as in 
  Daniel, the late Psalms, Ecclesiasticus [Sirach]); (2) the borrowings from Aramaic 
  increase in volume and Persian words come in (some of the Aramaisms are not 
  taken over bodily, but are translated into Hebrew, e.g., in Ecclesiastes); (3) 
  the popular language gains entrance into literature and thus leads Biblical 
  or literary Hebrew into Mishnaic or popular speech.</p>
<p>Mishnaic Hebrew.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, beginning with exilic times Aramaic influence began to 
  be felt in Palestine. Nehemiah complains that the children from mixed marriages 
  are unable to speak Hebrew (Neh. xiii. 24). For some centuries the two languages 
  were spoken side by side, somewhat like Low and High German in certain states 
  of Germany to-day. But as time went on the circle of the Hebrew-speaking population 
  narrowed down, in spite of that language having sole control of the school, 
  the synagogue, and the literature, until Hebrew became exclusively the language 
  of literature and prayer. In the house of the patriarch Judah I. the maid servant 
  still spoke Hebrew (Meg. 18a). The literary monuments of this last phase of 
  living Hebrew have been preserved in tannaitic literature, the chief work of 
  which is the Mishnah.</p>
<p>The &quot;language of the Mishnah&quot; (&quot;Pere? ?inyan Torah&quot;), or 
  &quot;the language of the sages&quot; ('Ab. Zarah 58b; ?ul. 137b; ?id. 2b), 
  as the language of tannaitic literature is called in later generations, is not 
  an artificial product of the schools, but is the living language of the last 
  centuries of Jewish independence. This has been convincingly shown by S. D. 
  Luzzatto (in &quot;Orient, Lit.&quot; 1846, col. 829; 1847, cols. 1 et seq.). 
  Mishnaic Hebrew differs from Biblical in the following particulars: in admitting 
  a greater contingent of Aramaic loan-words; in borrowing to a considerable extent 
  (about 300 vocables) from Greek and Latin; in the greater Aramaization of its 
  syntax; in the larger substitution of the reflexive verb-forms for the internal 
  passives; in the loss of the feminine plural forms of the imperfect; in the 
  use of the plural ending &quot;-in&quot; for &quot;-im&quot; and of the plural 
  suffix &quot;-n&quot; for &quot;-m&quot;; in the more definitely temporal use 
  of the tenses; in the wider use of the participle; in the introduction of periphrastic 
  verb-forms; in the substitution of the relative particle for the construct state; 
  in the more definite use of prepositions and conjunctions, and in the augmentation 
  of their number; and frequently in a different use of the gender of nouns. Words 
  are frequently used in their pausal forms outside of pause; Biblical words are 
  used in other than Biblical senses, and new forms are built from Biblical stems. 
  The laws of word-formation are, however, the same as in Biblical Hebrew. A conscious 
  imitation of Biblical language is noticeable in the liturgy only. In the rest 
  of tannaitic literature such imitation is expressly avoided (comp. ?ul. 137b).</p>
<p>Neo-Hebrew.</p>
<p>The term &quot;New Hebrew&quot; or &quot;Neo-Hebraic,&quot; by which post-Biblical 
  Hebrew is usually designated, should properly be used only for the language 
  of the reproductive period, beginning with amoraic literature (early in the 
  third century of the common era) and continuing until the present. This period 
  is of no interest to the student of Hebrew philology, but is of great importance 
  for the study of Hebrew literature. New Hebrew presents a variety of styles 
  differing not only according to periods, but also, and perhaps even in a greater 
  degree, according to the subjects treated. In the treatment of this form ofthe 
  language, periods and departments of literature must naturally cross one another. 
  In the first place, prose must be separated from poetry. As regards linguistic 
  peculiarities the prose literature may be divided into six groups; the poetical, 
  into five.</p>
<p>Original work in midrashic literature is not the rule: the greatest part of 
  it is compilation from older works. Probably most of these works were originally 
  written in Aramaic and translated by the compiler into Hebrew. This is especially 
  the case in the later Midrashim, while in the earlier compilations considerable 
  Aramaic material has been preserved. The language differs little from that of 
  the haggadic portion of tannaitic literature, and in some cases it has preserved 
  linguistic material from tannaitic times which is not found in any extant tannaitic 
  literature. Words which belong neither to Aramaic, Persian, Greek, nor Latin, 
  although not found in Mishnaic Hebrew, are certainly tannaitic. Here belong 
  also the halakic code (Yad ha-?aza?ah) of Maimonides, the language of which 
  is based on the language of the Mishnah, and the later codes imitating that 
  of Maimonides.</p>
<p>The writers on Talmudic subjects, especially the commentators of the Talmud 
  and the Pose?im or legal authorities, who adopted Mishnaic Hebrew and avoided 
  Biblical language, imitated to a great extent the Babylonian Talmud, interspersing 
  their Hebrew not infrequently with Aramaic. The necessary lack of esthetic qualities 
  in such a mixture is not very noticeable to one familiar from his youth with 
  the Talmud. But the application of this style of writing to other than Talmudical 
  subjects among medieval German Jews, loaded as it was with tasteless plays upon 
  words and tessellated with Biblical phrases wrongly used, presents an unesthetic 
  result difficult to understand and not very pleasing to a modern reader.</p>
<p>The language used chiefly by writers on philological and Biblical subjects 
  shows in its earliest forms the influence of the Bible and of the payye?anim 
  (comp., e.g., Ben Asher, Saadia, &quot;Yosippon,&quot; and the Ahimaaz Chronicle). 
  But the payye?anic influence soon disappears and leaves a midrashic Hebrew somewhat 
  influenced by the Bible and by philosophic Hebrew. The use of Aramaic elements 
  is very rare.</p>
<p>Philosophic and Rhetorical Hebrew.</p>
<p>The preceding phases contributed little to the increase of the vocabulary. 
  On syntax they had no influence whatsoever. This can not be said of the philosophic 
  phase, which differs so much from the preceding that a new name was applied 
  to it by medieval writers. It has been called &quot;the language of the translators,&quot; 
  or &quot;the language of astronomy&quot; (&quot;leshon tekunah&quot;). This 
  phase is a product of the translation of Arabic works on philosophy and science. 
  The insufficiency of the old language for the treatment of scientific subjects 
  was supplied by the creation of new word-forms, especially of abstract terms 
  and adjectives, by giving new meanings to old words, and by borrowing from the 
  Arabic. The new extensions of meanings were modeled on the cognate Arabic; and, 
  the translations being slavishly literal, the Hebrew received the imprint of 
  Arabic syntax. In many cases a familiarity with Arabic is necessary to understand 
  this kind of writing. This style was successfully imitated by philosophical 
  and scientific writers who wrote originally in Hebrew.</p>
<p>Closely akin to this form of language is that which appears in the writings 
  of the Karaites, except that Karaitic literature uses some payye?anic word-forms&#151;a 
  legacy of geonic times&#151;and a number of terms peculiar to itself.</p>
<p>The Samaritans also attempted to write Hebrew; but, with one notable exception 
  (comp. the Samaritan Chronicle, published in &quot;R. E. J.&quot; xliv. 188 
  et seq.), their Hebrew is only an object of curiosity.</p>
<p>In the last quarter of the eighteenth century a reaction set in against the 
  corrupt style of the German rabbis (see above). The writers of those days desired 
  to influence the people in the direction of estheticism. They therefore introduced 
  a style chiefly based on the Bible, the &quot;rhetorical&quot; style (&quot;meli?ah&quot;), 
  as it is called. This style occurs indeed even earlier, but in very rare cases 
  (comp., e.g., Archevolti, Oliveyra). Since the vocabulary of the Bible, taken 
  in its proper sense, is entirely insufficient to express modern ideas, resort 
  was had to periphrases, whose terms, taken from the Bible, frequently meant 
  something quite different in their original context. As a consequence the style 
  became stilted and bombastic, incapable of giving an exact expression to ideas 
  and things, and forcing the writer to be unnatural and to limit himself to jejune 
  subjects. This style dominated Hebrew literature for three generations.</p>
<p>The necessities of Jewish life in Russia and the rise of national consciousness 
  throughout European Jewry required a better-adapted vehicle of expression than 
  was offered by the rhetorical style; and this demand was supplied by the creation 
  of modern Hebrew. This style combines philological with philosophic Hebrew, 
  eliminating from the latter its Arabic syntax. It has created a number of new 
  terms to express modern ideas and things, drawing upon all phases of Hebrew, 
  and, through the Hebrew writers in Palestine, upon Arabic. Scientific terms 
  for which it has no equivalent it adopts from the modern languages. The periodic 
  structure of the sentence is successfully cultivated.</p>
<p>Poetry.</p>
<p>Later Hebrew poetry may be divided into (1) payye?anic or liturgical, frequently 
  having rime but no meter, and (2) metrical, first introduced by Dunash b. Labra?. 
  The language of the payye?anim may again be subdivided into an earlier and a 
  later period. The earlier period (c. 800-1100) presents a language based on 
  the whole on the Bible, but enriched with a multitude of new forms. The number 
  of new nounformations in the piyyu? amount to more than forty. New verbs are 
  formed from nouns and particles; new verb-forms are used for or alongside of 
  older ones; defective stems are treated as biconsonantal, or more correctly 
  as middle-waw stems; the inseparable prepositions are used with the finite verb; 
  new plural forms are used where the older language has only the singular, or 
  the singular is used where the older language has only the plural; masculine 
  nouns are abstracted from older feminine forms, andnew feminine forms are built 
  from older masculine forms. Some nouns have double plural endings; the masculine 
  ending is sometimes used where the older language has the feminine, and vice 
  versa.</p>
<p>The later piyyu? literature, especially the penitential hymns, abandons a number 
  of payye?anic word-forms and uses more Talmudic expressions.</p>
<p>The language used in metrical poetry presents, broadly speaking, three styles: 
  the Spanish, the German, and the Russian. The language of the Spanish school 
  follows the philosophic style and, though chiefly based on the Bible, contains 
  a number of Arabisms in the significations of words, in phraseology and, more 
  rarely, in syntactical constructions. The German style imitates chiefly the 
  rhetorical style, is smoother in construction and purer in diction, but nerveless. 
  The Russian or modern style strives after realism; it can not, therefore, limit 
  itself to Biblical phrases, but uses the resources of all periods, even the 
  latest coining of words.</p>
<p>Revival of Hebrew as a Spoken Language.</p>
<p>The national and realistic tendencies of the present generation have inspired 
  many writers to try to enlarge the vocabulary of the language by the coinage 
  of new terms and to revive Hebrew as a spoken language. Throughout Europe circles 
  were formed that had as their object the cultivation of Hebrew conversation. 
  It was in the nature of conditions that in Europe such efforts could meet with 
  no signal success. It was otherwise in Palestine. There the resurrection of 
  Hebrew as the tongue of the home and of the school has been realized to a considerable 
  degree. See Dictionaries; Grammar, Hebrew; Literature, Hebrew; Poetry, Didactic;

<p></p>
<p>Like Syriac, and probably under its influence, Hebrew has been handed down 
  with a twofold pronunciation, the Ashkenazic and the Sephardic. The former is 
  usually traced to Babylonia, the latter to Palestine. There are at present no 
  sufficient data for a decision as to the tenability of this theory. On the one 
  hand it is known that the Sephardim (i.e., the Spanish-Portuguese Jews) came 
  to Europe from Palestine, while the Ashkenazim (i.e., the German-Slavonic Jews) 
  came, at least in part, through southern Russia from Babylonia and Mesopotamia. 
  It is known also that the vowel &quot;?ame?&quot; was pronounced in Palestine 
  from the time of the Septuagint down to Jerome as the a in the English word 
  &quot;father.&quot;</p>
<p>Pronunciation of ?amez.</p>
<p>This would tend to support the theory of a Palestinian origin for the Sephardic 
  pronunciation. But against it are the following considerations: The analogy 
  of the Syriac would indicate that the &quot;?a?e?&quot; was pronounced a in 
  Babylonia and &ocirc; in Palestine. There is no proof that the Babylonians in 
  early times pronounced the &quot;?ame?&quot; like &ocirc;. The o sound of that 
  vowel was known even to Philo of Alexandria (Siegfried, in &quot;Merx's Archiv,&quot; 
  vol. i.), and, according to Abraham ibn Ezra (&quot;?a?ot,&quot; p. 3b), was 
  the prevalent one in Tiberias and North Africa in later times. Two of the systems 
  of vocalization which have been handed down had, according to tradition, their 
  origin in Palestine, and agree with the traditional Babylonian system of vocalization 
  in representing &quot;?ame?&quot; as o. The first Russian Jews might have adopted 
  the pronunciation of their German brethren, just as they have adopted their 
  language. The nasal sound of the letter ? common among the Sephardim, might 
  be traced to Babylonia, but is not known to have existed in Palestine. As has 
  been stated above, the modern pronunciation is usually separated into that of 
  the Ashkenazim and that of the Sephardim, including among the latter the Oriental 
  Jews. But a better knowledge of the Orient shows the advisability of classifying 
  the Oriental Jews as a distinct group.</p>
<p>Ashkenazic Pronunciation.</p>
<p>The data utilized in the following exposition have in part been gathered from 
  the reports of travelers; in most cases, however, they are based on personal 
  observation and oral communications. Under such circumstances neither completeness 
  nor scientific accuracy can be vouched for. To the Ashkenazim belong the mass 
  of the Jews inhabiting Europe and America&#151;in Europe those of Russia, Rumania, 
  Austria-Hungary, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, France, and England. In European 
  Turkey and the Balkan states, in Italy and Holland, the Sephardim form, perhaps, 
  the bulk of the Jewish population.</p>
<p>The Jewish population of France, England, Sweden, Denmark, and the United States 
  consists of more recent immigrants, German and Russian; that of Rumania is largely 
  of Russian origin. These communities have therefore no pronunciation of their 
  own, and consequently are not considered here.For the same reason the Jews in 
  the German territory of Austria, and in Hungary, are left out of consideration. 
  The chief countries having characteristic pronunciation are Russia, Germany, 
  and Slavonic Austria.</p>
<p>Throughout the Ashkenazic group the following sounds are identical: (b); (g); 
  (d); ?(h); ? (z); ? (German ch in &quot;ach&quot;); ? (y); (k); ? (l); ? (m); 
  ? (n); ? (s); (p); ? (f); ? (ts); ? (k); (s). The letters ? and ? are not pronounced 
  except when standing between two vowels, in which case they form a hiatus. The 
  quantity of the vowels is not observed; a, i, and i have the Italian sounds 
  of a and i. Post-vocalic ? and ?, when in the tone-syllable, are frequently 
  pronounced like ? (comp. Levias, &quot;Aramaic Grammar,&quot; p. 9, note 6). 
  All words, except and (&quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;God&quot;), are accented on 
  the penult. All post-tonic vowels are reduced to the indefinite sound &egrave;. 
  The vocal &quot;shewa,&quot; at the beginning as well as in the middle of a 
  word, is usually disregarded. The &quot;?a?efs&quot; are frequently treated 
  as full vowels. All such characteristics are common in private reading of Hebrew 
  and in pronouncing the Hebrew vocables which have entered the vernacular. In 
  the public reading of the Bible in the synagogues, however, every vowel is given 
  a distinct sound, and the Masoretic accent is observed; all this with a degree 
  of correctness dependent upon the knowledge of the individual reader. Notice 
  the pronunciation of .</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>The Jews of the Russian empire may be broadly divided into two groups&#151;those 
  of Lithuania and those of the former kingdom of Poland. The difference in the 
  pronunciation of the two groups is mostly in the vowel-sounds. Both pronounce 
  ? and ? like v; ? and like t; like ?; but the Lithuanians, especially those 
  of the old province of Samogitia, frequently interchange and , pronouncing the 
  former s and the latter sh, a pronunciation attested also for Italy by the grammarian 
  S. Hanau (&quot;Yesod ha-Ni??ud,&quot; p. 2a) and occurring sporadically in 
  Poland and elsewhere. It is to this pronunciation that some attribute the origin 
  of the name of the sect of the ?asidim, being the Polish pronunciation of (&quot;suspected 
  of heresy&quot;; comp. &quot;Ha-Bo?er Or,&quot; v. 165). The pronunciation of 
  ? in the South is more rolled than in the North; the sound of the French r (&quot;grassey&eacute;&quot;) 
  is heard in Volhynia. In the same province one frequently hears the misplacement 
  of the ?, which is omitted where it should be pronounced and pronounced where 
  it has no place.</p>
<p>In Lithuania the vowels are pronounced as follows: &quot;?ame?&quot; = &ocirc;, 
  the sound heard in the English word &quot;nor&quot;; &quot;?ere,&quot; = &eacute;, 
  the sound heard in the English &quot;they&quot;; &quot;segol&quot; = e, as in 
  the English &quot;bed&quot;; &quot;?olem&quot; = &eacute;, at times = the e 
  sound in &quot;err&quot;; &quot;shure?&quot; and &quot;?ibbu?&quot; = oo in 
  &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fool.&quot; No distinction is made among the Ashkenazim 
  as to the quantity of vowels. Vocal &quot;shewa&quot; in monosyllabic words 
  ending in a vowel is usually pronounced like &quot;?ere.&quot; &quot;?a?ef&quot; 
  sounds are frequently pronounced like full vowels; and &quot;shewa&quot; and 
  &quot;?a?ef&quot; when so pronounced, usually have also the accent.</p>
<p>Austria and Germany.</p>
<p>In Poland, Volhynia, and Podolia the &quot;?ame?,&quot; when in an open syllable, 
  has the sound of oo in &quot;good&quot; or &quot;fool,&quot; when in a closed 
  syllable that of o in &quot;dog&quot;; &quot;?ere&quot; = ei in &quot;height&quot;; 
  &quot;segol&quot; = ey in &quot;they&quot; in an open syllable, at times = &quot;?ere&quot;; 
  in a closed syllable it is e as in &quot;bed.&quot; &quot;?olem&quot; = oi in 
  &quot;noise&quot;; &quot;shure?&quot; and &quot;?ibbu?&quot; = i in &quot;pin.&quot; 
  The influx of Jewish immigrants from Spain and Portugal in the fifteenth and 
  sixteenth centuries has left its imprint on the Jews of Russia in the pronunciation 
  of individual words, where &quot;?ame?&quot; is pronounced a, &quot;?ere,&quot; 
  &egrave;, and &quot;?olem,&quot; &ocirc; (comp. Lebensohn, &quot;Yitron la-Adam,&quot; 
  pp. 24, 25). In Poland, Volhynia, Podolia, and Galicia the nasal sound of ? 
  is heard in the name (&quot;Yankeb&quot;) and, in public reading, a similar 
  sound is heard in the relative particle . The same nasal sound of ? is heard 
  here and there in England and Holland also. The pronunciation in Galicia or 
  Austrian Poland is identical with that in Russian Poland.</p>
<p>In Moravia, &quot;?ame?&quot; = the o in &quot;note&quot; when in an open syllable; 
  o as in &quot;dog&quot; when in a closed syllable; &quot;?olem&quot; = oi in 
  &quot;noise&quot;; &quot;?ere,&quot; and &quot;segol&quot; in an open syllable 
  = &eacute; in &quot;they&quot;; &quot;shure?&quot; and &quot;?ibbu?&quot;= German 
  &uuml; or French u. The &quot;?ame?&quot; is pronounced o in an open syllable, 
  o; in a closed syllable, throughout Germany. In rare cases it has also the sound 
  of the German au (= ou in &quot;out&quot;) (comp. &quot;R. E. J.&quot; xvi. 
  148, 278). &quot;?ere&quot; in Silesia = the German ai (= i in &quot;isle&quot;) 
  as in Poland; in the rest of Germany e as in &quot;they&quot;; in Bavaria &quot;?ere&quot; 
  = &eacute; &quot;Segol&quot; = e, in an open syllable. &quot;?olem,&quot; in 
  Prussia, Baden, and Saxony = o; in Hanover, Westphalia, Silesia, Hamburg, and 
  Bavaria = au. &quot;Shure?&quot; and &quot;?ibbu?&quot; everywhere = u (as in 
  &quot;full&quot;).</p>
<p>In Bavaria, Hanover, and Westphalia and , and and , are interchangeable. In 
  some cases the sound of is that of ch in the German &quot;ich.&quot; and ? at 
  the end of a syllable have in the German southern states the sound of f. In 
  the city of Friedrichstadt and in Upper Silesia ? is pronounced h. In Hamburg 
  ? is sometimes pronounced like ?.</p>
<p>Sephardim and Orientals.</p>
<p>The Sephardim form larger communities in Turkey proper and its former dependencies, 
  and in Italy and Holland. In Spain and Portugal, their former homes, there are 
  at present only a few, these being recent immigrants from various countries.</p>
<p>The pronunciation of the consonants in Italy differs from the Ashkenazic in 
  the following: ? is silent; ? is a guttural nasal; ? is s; is d (Spanish). In 
  Turkey, ? is ?; ? is s; is t. Other letters are pronounced as among the Ashkenazim. 
  The vowels are pronounced in both countries as they are given in the ordinary 
  grammars: &quot;?ame?&quot; and &quot;pata?&quot; = a, &quot;?olem&quot; and 
  &quot;?ame? ?a?uf&quot; = o, &quot;?ere&quot; = &ecirc;, &quot;segol&quot; = 
  &egrave; or e &quot;shure?&quot; and &quot;?ibbu?&quot; = u. Under the division 
  of Orientals belong the Jews in Syria, Morocco, Yemen, Cochin, and China, and 
  the Samaritans. The pronunciation inSyria shows the following differences: are 
  both pronounced like j in &quot;jet,&quot; or g in &quot;strange&quot;; ? is 
  the English w; ? is ?; ? is ?; ?? is the English ch in &quot;check,&quot; &quot;rich&quot;; 
  ? has the sound of the Arabic letter &quot;'ain&quot;; ? = the English s in 
  &quot;hiss&quot;; ? is pronounced like as th in &quot;thin.&quot; All the vowels 
  are pronounced as in Italy. In Morocco the letters , are pronounced as their 
  equivalent Arabic sounds, ', gh, dh, w, ?, ?, kh, ', ?, ?. According to some, 
  ? is the English ch in &quot;check,&quot; &quot;rich&quot;; ? = ts. According 
  to other reports, has also the sound of ch in &quot;check.&quot; The vowels 
  &quot;?olem&quot; and &quot;shure?&quot; = &quot;?ibbu?&quot; are almost indistinguishable; 
  so with &quot;?ere&quot; and &quot;?ire?&quot; &quot;Pata?&quot; and &quot;segol&quot; 
  are frequently interchanged. The a vowel of the article is omitted. Vocal &quot;shewa&quot; 
  before the gutturals is sounded like the following vowel: &quot;shewa&quot; 
  with &quot;ga'ya&quot; = a.</p>
<p>In Yemen, have the sounds of the corresponding Arabic letters, as given above. 
  ?? = g, j, as in English &quot;strange,&quot; &quot;jet&quot;; is, according 
  to Maltzan (&quot;Reise nach S&uuml;d-Arabien,&quot; i. 177), always b; according 
  to Safir (&quot;Eben Sappir,&quot; i. 54) it is v. ? is in ?an'a pronounced 
  g, as in &quot;good.&quot; The vowels are pronounced; &quot;?ame?&quot; and 
  &quot;pata?,&quot; as in Germany; &quot;?olem,&quot; as in Poland; &quot;?ere,&quot; 
  as in Italy; &quot;segol,&quot; like the German a, or the English a in &quot;span&quot;; 
  &quot;shewa&quot; before a guttural has the sound of the following vowel; before 
  ? like i; otherwise like a very short a. &quot;Pata?&quot; and &quot;segol&quot; 
  are frequently interchanged. According to Maltzan (l.c.) &quot;?olem&quot; is 
  pronounced &eacute;, as in Lithuania. The Jews in Cochin pronounce and as in 
  Yemen. ? is pronounced like ?, and ? like ?. The Jews in China pronounce &quot;?ame?&quot; 
  as o; &quot;?ere&quot; as i&eacute; (French); ?? = p; ?? = t; ? = l.</p>

<p align="center">The History of Hebrew</p>
<p align="center">Eliezer Ben-Yehuda Hebrew </p>
<p>To hear some people tell it, you&#146;d think that Zionism began with the holocaust, 
  and that our people started the return to their homeland at the end of the second 
  world war. There are those who will tell you that our great leaders, Hertzl 
  and Nordau and Usishkin, Weizman and Ben-Gurion and Begin -- were all stooges 
  of the great &#147;imperialist&#148; nations -- France, Great Britain and the 
  United States. How can we fight such lies and historical distortions? Well, 
  we can begin by turning the spot light on one frail Jew who lived from 1858 
  to 1922. His name was Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, and I am his grandson. He was born 
  Eliezer Yitzhak Perelman in Luzhky, Lithuania, to Feyga and Yehuda Lieb Perelman, 
  a Habad Hasid, died when Eliezer was only five years old. He attended Yeshivah 
  in Polotsk, and was introduced there to the changing ideas in Judaism, Haskalah 
  -- enlightenment, and secular Hebrew literature. &#147;Discovered&#148; in this 
  &#147;heresy,&#148; he was expelled from his uncle&#146;s home and found shelter 
  in Glubokoye, a small town in the Vilna district, in the home of Samuel Naphtali 
  Herz Jonas, also a Habad Hasid, who was quit learned, writing and reading Russian, 
  French and Hebrew. Jonas persuaded him to prepare for secondary school matriculation, 
  and his eldest daughter Deborah taught him Russian and French. He entered the 
  Dvinsk Gymnasium, from which he graduated in 1877. The second half of the nineteenth 
  century was a time of national turmoil throughout Europe. The Russo-Turkish 
  War (1877-78) and the struggle of the Balkan nations for liberation were probably 
  most influential in planting in young Eliezer the idea of the revival of the 
  Jewish people on its ancestral soil. In an unfinished autobiography which he 
  wrote while in the U.S. in 1917-18, he revealed that &#147;In those days it 
  was as if the heavens had suddenly opened, and a clear, incandescent light flashed 
  before my eyes and a mighty inner voice sounded in my ears &#145;the resurrection 
  of Israel on its ancestral soil.&#146; Because of that voice, which has not 
  ceased from that moment on to ring in my ears day and night, all my thoughts 
  and plans which I had for my future life were shaken up. As night visions pale 
  in the face of the light of day, so were my dreams of dedicating my life to 
  the cause of freedom in the Russian nation replaced with a single ideal, manifest 
  in two Hebrew words, &#145;Yisrael b&#146;artzo&#146; -- Israel in its own land! 
  I was challenged by many, and one argument said that the Jews are not now and 
  could not be in the future a nation -- because they did not possess a common 
  tongue. I tried to argue, as others did, that there are nations such as the 
  Swiss and the Belgians, who speak more than one language -- but the more I thought 
  of the national revival the more I realized what a tongue can do to unite a 
  people. I realized that just as the Jews could not become a living nation except 
  by returning to their ancient homeland -- so also they could not become a living 
  nation except by returning to the language of their ancestors, speaking it not 
  only in prayer and study but also in all matters of life, young and old alike, 
  at all hours of the day and night -- just like every other nation, each with 
  its tongue. That was the decisive moment in my life, when I saw that the two 
  things without which the Jews could not become a nation are the land and the 
  language! &#148; Eliezer began to actively &#145;preach&#146; that the Jewish 
  people, like all other peoples, had a historic land and a historic language. 
  What was needed was to actuate a national movement that would restore Israel 
  to its land and to its language. He determined to settle in Eretz Israel, and 
  in 1878 went to Paris to study medicine so that he might have a profession to 
  sustain himself. He discussed his plan for a Jewish national movement with some 
  Hebrew writers he met there; they, however, were not interested. His article 
  &#147;She&#146;elah Lohatah&#148; (&#147;A Burning Question&#148;) was published 
  in P. Smolenskin&#146;s Ha-Shakhar in 1879 (after Ha-Maggid had refused to accept 
  it) under the name &#147;E. Ben-Yehuda.&#148; For the first time the idea of 
  a national rebirth of a Jewish nation in Eretz Israel was clearly propounded. 
  Ben-Yehuda linked the Jewish national revival with the general European awakening 
  and said that the Jewish people should learn from the oppressed European peoples 
  that were fighting for political freedom and national revival. The Jewish people 
  must establish a community in Eretz Israel that would serve as a focal point 
  for the entire people, so that even those Jews who would remain in other lands 
  would know that they belong to a people that dwells in its own land and has 
  its own language and culture. In this essay, the fundamental principles of Zionism 
  were actually anticipated: the settlement of the land not for the return of 
  the entire people from the exile (as in the days of Messiah in a fulfillment 
  of prophecy), but for the creation or a national entity, an independent nation 
  designed to save from assimilation and annihilation those Jews that are scattered 
  all over the world and who wish to migrate there. While studying medicine in 
  Paris Ben-Yehuda contracted tuberculosis in the winter of 1878 and his doctors 
  did not forecast a long and happy life for him. He resolved to discontinue his 
  medical studies and make his home in the more favorable climate of Eretz Israel, 
  where he hoped he could continue his advocacy for a national reawakening for 
  a while before succumbing to his illness. He enrolled in the teachers&#146; 
  seminary of the Alliance Israelite Universelle, to qualify for a teaching post 
  in their agricultural school, Mikveh Israel. There he attended the lectures 
  of the Assyrologist Joseph Halevy who in the periodical Ha-Maggid had advocated 
  the coinage of new Hebrew words as early as the 1860s. As his health deteriorated, 
  Ben-Yehuda entered the Rothschild Hospital in Paris, and there he met the Jerusalem 
  scholar A. M. Lunz who spoke Hebrew to him in the Sephardi pronunciation, and 
  told him that the members of the various Jewish communities in Jerusalem were 
  able to converse with one another only in Sephardi Hebrew. This reinforced Ben-Yehuda&#146;s 
  opinion that the Jews could not hope to become a united people in their own 
  land again unless their children revived Hebrew as their spoken tongue. The 
  Hebrew living language must have Sephardi phonetic sounds because that was the 
  pronunciation which served in the transliteration or biblical names in ancient 
  and modern translations of the Bible. In 1880 he published two articles in Hakhav&#146;atzelet 
  in which he advocated that Hebrew rather than the various foreign languages 
  become the language of instruction in the Jewish schools in Eretz Israel. Ben-Yehuda, 
  alone among and unique from all the prophets of Jewish national renaissance, 
  saw the whole picture of the need for a people wedded to a land, speaking its 
  own language. In 1881, he left for Jerusalem. He traveled by way of Vienna, 
  where he was joined by his childhood sweetheart, Deborah Jonas. He had written 
  to her of his illness and his dim chance of a long and full life. He bade her 
  forget him -- but she surprised him with a Ruth-like pledge, &#147;wherever 
  you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge...&#148; They married in 
  Cairo, on their way to make a home in the once and future land of Israel. In 
  October 1881, they arrived in Jaffa where Eliezer informed his wife that henceforth 
  they would converse only in Hebrew. The Ben-Yehuda household thus was the first 
  Hebrew-speaking home established in Jerusalem, and their first son, Ben-Zion 
  (who later became known by his pen-name, Itamar Ben-Avi) was the first modern 
  Hebrew-speaking child. Soon after he and Deborah arrived in Jerusalem, before 
  the end of 1881, Ben-Yehuda, together with Y.M. Fines, D. Yellin, Y. Meyuhas, 
  and A. Mazie founded the society Tekhiyat Israel based on five principles: work 
  on the land and expansion of the country&#146;s productive population; revival 
  of spoken Hebrew; creation of a modern Hebrew literature and science in the 
  national spirit; education of the youth in a national and, at the same time, 
  universal humanistic spirit; and active opposition to the halukkah (dole) system. 
  During the period 1882-85, Ben Yehuda worked on a Hebrew periodical published 
  in Jerusalem, called Ha-khavazzelet, and put out a supplement to the periodical 
  under the name Mevasseret Zi&#146;yon. This journalistic work satisfied his 
  need to be politically active for the nationalist cause. At the same time, he 
  taught in the Jerusalem Alliance school, which post he accepted only after he 
  was permitted to use Hebrew exclusively as the language of instruction in all 
  Jewish subjects. The school was thus the first in which at least some subjects 
  were taught in Hebrew. Ben-Yehuda published a geography book called &#145;Eretz 
  Yisrael,&#146; and translated many texts to use in his classroom to teach everything 
  from mathematics to world literature. Toward the end of 1884, he founded a weekly, 
  Ha-Zevi, which later became a biweekly under the new name, Ha-Or. In his class 
  and in his papers he constantly coined new words for everything that had no 
  words since Hebrew was last used. He published a &#147;list of words&#148; in 
  every paper he published, but before long it became obvious that people could 
  not keep collecting these lists -- there was a need for a &#147;book of words&#148; 
  -- yes, even the word for dictionary did not exist in the tongue of the prophets. 
  Ben-Yehuda thus was launched on his greatest undertaking: Milon Halashon Ha&#146;ivrit 
  ha&#146;yshana vehakhadasha -- the Dictionary of the Hebrew Language, ancient 
  and modern. In 1891, Ben-Yehuda&#146;s wife, Deborah, died of the disease that 
  he had contracted in Paris. On her death bed she wrote a letter to her sister, 
  sixteen years her junior. &#147;If you want to be a queen,&#148; her letter 
  said, &#147;then hurry to Jerusalem and marry my prince, my darling Eliezer.&#148; 
  Ben-Yehuda was a broken man after the death of his Deborah -- but the sister 
  began her campaign to fulfill her sister&#146;s wish. She wrote to him, pretending 
  an interest in Hebrew -- which he, of course, could not resist. She chose a 
  Hebrew name for herself -- Hemda. It meant &#147;darling&#148; -- and that&#146;s 
  how she unlocked his heart. About six months later he married her, and she became 
  his constant companion in his political and literary activity. Hemda Ben-Yehuda 
  mastered Hebrew quickly, published translations and original Hebrew stories 
  in his periodicals, and wrote columns for his papers on everything from fashion 
  to cooking to advice for love-struck maidens. Ben Yehuda&#146;s unorthodox behavior, 
  and the campaign which he waged in the columns of his periodicals against the 
  halukkah system and its administrators, aroused the vehement opposition of the 
  extreme Orthodox Jews. Seeking a pretext for revenge, they found it in an article 
  by his father in law, Samuel Naphtali Herz Jonas, in the 1894 Hanukkah issue 
  of Ha-Zevi -- which contained the phrase &#147;let us gather strength and go 
  forward.&#148; Some of Ben-Yehuda&#146;s more bigoted enemies distorted its 
  meaning and interpreted it to the Turkish authorities as &#147;let us gather 
  an army and proceed against the East.&#148; Ben-Yehuda was charged with sedition 
  and placed in jail where he spent a year. Condition in the jail were, of course, 
  appalling, as befits a prison in the Turkish Empire in those days. Eliezer, 
  whose health was never good, began to cough blood. Hemda turned heaven and earth 
  trying to enlist influential people in his behalf. The affair created a great 
  stir throughout the Jewish world: an appeal was lodged, aided by a large bribe 
  to the governor of Jerusalem, and Eliezer was suddenly released. However, Turkish 
  censorship of Ha-Zev&#146;i became more stringent from then on, and Ben-Yehuda 
  ceased his journalistic work and began to concentrate more on linguistic questions 
  to which the censors could make no objection. He became increasingly engrossed 
  in his dictionary for which he had begun to collect material from the day he 
  arrived in Eretz Israel. In order to conduct research and raise funds for its 
  publication, Ben-Yehuda traveled several times to Europe together with his wife 
  Hemda. Turkey joined the First World War on the side of Germany, and Eliezer&#146;s 
  continued presence in Jerusalem was a risk not worth taking. He was whisked 
  away to Egypt in a caravan of camels, and from there to the United States in 
  a U.S. Navy ship. He was a house guest of the Whorthiem family in New York, 
  where he worked in American libraries, being the only man ever to be given a 
  room to do research at the New York public library on 42 street and Fifth Avenue. 
  In 1910, assisted by various sponsors, he began to publish his dictionary volume 
  by volume; Having finished the manuscript for the entire dictionary -- but not 
  the editing, his life came to an end on the second night of Hanukkah, the Festival 
  of the Maccabees, those ancient champions of the Jewish nation. After his death 
  in 1922, Hemda and his son Ehud, my father, continued his publication which, 
  because of the ravages of the depression and the second World War and the battle 
  for Israel&#146;s independence, was completed, in sixteen volumes plus an introductory 
  volume called Ha-Mavo-ha-Gadol (the great introduction) in 1959. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda 
  has been recognized by history -- Jewish and non-Jewish, for his role in the 
  revival of the tongue of the prophets. His role in the rebirth of the Jewish 
  nation is much less known or acknowledged. However, it needs to be -- it should 
  be proclaimed from the rooftops daily! Why? Because it lends legitimacy to the 
  Zionist enterprise and dates its beginning beyond any reasonable doubt. His 
  work of the Hebrew was a tool for Zionist success. It is doubtful if the Jews 
  returning from the four corners of the world could have agreed in a national 
  language for their reborn state had Hebrew not been prepared for them ahead 
  of time by Ben-Yehuda. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda is buried in the Mount Olives cemetery 
  in Jerusalem, in a family grave-sight bordered by a wrought iron fence with 
  a gate above which there is an inscription in old Hebrew characters -- the same 
  type of characters that he used on his family crest -- a map of eretz yisrael 
  framed in the shape of a house. In is the Hebrew Homeland -- and above its roof 
  is the legend, &#147;ein zo agada&#148; -- it is no dream! Why is it not a dream, 
  you ask? Maybe because he willed it so much, dedicating his life, his wife, 
  his children, to that cause. <br>
