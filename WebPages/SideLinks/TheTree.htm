    of more than a thousand hymns composed in northwest India about 1500BC, in 
    an archaic form of Sanskrit, an ancient Indo-European language. In addition 
    to this canon, numerous myths appear in commentaries composed a few centuries 
    later and known as the <i>Brahmanas</i>. These texts were not committed to 
    writing for many centuries after their composition, but oral tradition preserved 
    them and later Hindu literature draws heavily upon their characters and events.</font></p>

  <p>The central myth of the <i>Rig Veda</i> is the myth of creation. This is 
    described in several different ways. Often the universe is said to have come 
    into being OUT OF CHAOS,<font size="3"> <font size="2">(compare Genesis 1:2)</font></font>, 
    when a god--Indra, king of the gods and god of rain, or Vishnu, a solar deity--SEPARATED

    10:25)</font>. </font>Then the Sun arose AND FROM THAT SPOT, THE NAVEL OF

    and invisible appearing in the phenomenal world with no clear-cut distinction 
    between transcendental unity and immanent diversity. In a word 'Kokutai' proves 
    the magnifying in conception of the Human Body; and a fresh approach to the 
    study of Japanese culture from this psychosomatic point of view scarcely fails 
    to yield a plentiful harvest which has never been thought of by the forerunners 
    of Japanology who subscribe to the Western positivistic method, and who set 
    aside any subjective factors as scientifically irrelevant...But we shall not 
    understand what is meant by the inarticulate word 'Kokutai' (the Body of State),

    Japanese mythology, which narrates how Japan was brought into being.</font></p>

    (the Immeasurable Splendour)...The worship of Amitabha illustrates how much 
    original Buddhism has changed. The Buddha taught that redemption had to be

  <p>&quot;The quest for an earthly Paradise is one of the oldest and most enduring 
    themes of mythology. Ancient clay tablets dating back to the 2nd millenium

    Sun in search of the secrets of immortality. In the second century B.C. the

    Mu--the dwelling of the immortals, hidden in the mysterious Kunlun Mountains 
    <font size="2">(to the West)</font>. During the middle ages Irish monks set 
    out on the Atlantic, seeking legendary isles of the Blessed where they might 
    find salvation. Centuries later Pilgrims crossed the ocean, hoping to find 
    a Garden of Eden in the new world.</p>
  <p>Tibetans have long held a tradition of just such an earthly Paradise, called 
    Shambhala--a mythical kingdom that is hidden among the snow mountains north 
    of Tibet. There in the sanctuary free from strife and want, a line of divine 
    kings is said to be preserving the highest teachings of Buddhism for a time 
    in the future when barbarians will destroy all true religion in the world 
    outside. When the barbariaans try to conquer Shambhala, a saviour king will

  And he showed me a mountain range of fire that burnt day and night.<br>
  And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains, all differing from 
  the other,<br>
  and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful, magnificent as a whole, 
  of glorious appearance and fair exterior.<br>
  Three towards the east, one founded on the other, and three towards the south, 
  one upon the other,<br>
  and deep ravines no one of which joined with any other.<br>
  And the seventh mountain was in the midst of these, and it excelled them in 
  height, resembling the seat of a throne.<br>
  And fragrant trees encircled the throne.<br>
  And amongst them was a tree such as I had never yet smelt, neither was any amongst 
  them nor were others like it.<br>
  It had a fragrance beyond all fragrance, and its leaves and wood wither not 
  forever.<br>
  And its fruit is beautiful and its fruit resembles the dates of palm.<br>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">The Boabab Tree</font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    Baobab Tree is a symbol of the strength of Africa. There are any myths and 
    legends about the Baobab Tree and it is revered for its healing properties. 
    The most common myth is that the gods in error, planted the Baobab tree upside, 
    hence its strange shape. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">In 
    June 1999 I received a message from a plant spirit to go and make the essence 
    of a beautiful white flower which I saw as a vision in my mind during a mediatation. 
    It had large white petals and a profusion of white stamens emerging from it. 
    I later found out the flower I had seen was that of the Baobab Tree. I was 
    asked to go in December 1999 to the north of South Africa to make the remedy, 
    and was told that it would help to "heal the scars of South Africa" and bring 
    black and white people together. The struggle for freedom in South Africa 
    has become a symbol for the struggle more widely in the world to end wars 
    and inequality. The Baobab Flower Essence will be helpful to anybody who wishes 
    to further this cause, as well as those that have been directly and indirectly 
    affected by racism, oppression and war. The essence will help to balance the 
    collective energies of all people in the world. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    signature of the Baobab Flower Remedy is that it will assist in the spiritual 
    transformation in the exciting times we live in at the beginning of the Age 
    of Aquarius. The flower is a large, white waxy flower with 5 petals. The flower 
    has a prehistoric feel to it, and is pollinated by fruit bats. The Baobab 
    has 5 petals and 5 leaves, and the number 5 in numerology represents the emotional 
    plane (the heart). The flower essence relates specifically to the heart and 
    crown chakras, opening our hearts and minds to the higher forces of the Universe. 
    The essence will help people to see how spiritually we are all ONE on the 
    same journey home. The word Baobab means "the time when man began", a time 
    where we were all One and our journey home is to return to this state of being, 
    oneness with other human beings and nature. The new millennium also marks 
    a time for a new beginning of man and woman, as the consciousness of Oneness 
    continues to expand and grow across the globe. It is a time where people are 
    increasingly taking responsibility for their own lives, health and the environment 
    rather than relying on governments or other institutions. The success of this 
    journey will mean an end to all forms of war, oppression and ecological destruction 
    as our respect for all life becomes central to our way of thinking. The Baobab 
    Flower Essence is a gift from nature to help humanity on this journey. The 
    ascending astrological sign of the Baobab Essence is Aries, which is the start 
    of the zodiac and indicates the start of a new cycle. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    Essence is able to heal wounds from lifetimes in the Age of Pisces as well 
    as the Age of Aries. The Age of Aries started when Moses led the Jews out 
    of bondage, according to the bible. It is also reputed that the Archangel 
    Raphael gave Moses the book of all herbs to heal maladies. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    other distinctive feature of the Baobab Tree is that it can undergo a huge 
    amount of mutilation, and still continue to thrive and heal. For example, 
    I visited a Baobab Tree with a pub inside it near Magoebaskloof, which amazingly 
    was still alive and well. This indicates that the Flower remedy of the tree 
    can heal even the deepest scars and mutilation of body and spirit. It is a 
    tree of incredible resilience, strength and self-healing properties. It is 
    interesting that a Baobab Tree of South Africa has chosen to give us this 
    gift, where the divide between black and white people has been most marked, 
    and has caused very deep wounds and spiritual and emotional damage to both 
    the oppressed and oppressors. The astrological birthchart of the essence also 
    indicates that it can heal very deep wounds, particularly emotional and spiritual 
    wounds. Chiron (the Wounded Healer Archetype), Vulcan (a hypothetical transneptunian 
    planet who helps to put our dismembered and fragmented bits back together), 
    Pluto (the unconscious and dark side) and the Sun (the heart) are all found 
    in the 9th House of the Chart, the house of long distance travel. In one case 
    the Baobab Essence healed a flesh wound virtually overnight. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    Baobab Essence has been very useful for pain, for example back pain or pain 
    caused by arthritis, again having almost instantaneous results. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    leaves of the Baobab Tree resemble an outstretched hand, hence its Latin name 
    Adansonia Digitata, as if reaching out in friendship. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    Baobab is unusual in that it is approximately 90% water, and swells up after 
    the rains. It is therefore a tree that mirrors a human being and the earth, 
    which are also comprised of 90% water. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    bark and leaves of the Baobab tree are used medicinally by the indigenous 
    people of the area for a number of physical illnesses including chest complaints, 
    fever and malaria. The flower essence of the tree may also help with these 
    illnesses. The flower of the tree is the most evolved part of the plant and 
    therefore contains the medicinal properties of the whole. In bushmen paintings 
    women are depicted with breasts of the Baobab fruit, and the essence may help 
    with fertility. The flower essence also holds the wisdom of all the incarnations 
    of the tree and all other trees of its species. As the tree is prehistoric 
    this is a lot of wisdom! As previously mentioned the essence may also help 
    to heal flesh wounds. Many people have reported that the Baobab has good (miraculous 
    in a few cases) effects on pain, especially for the back and related to arthritis. 
    </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    Baobab Flower Remedy was made in Messina, near the border of South Africa 
    and Zimbabwe on the 14th December 1999. It was made in the cycle of the brightest 
    Full Moon for 173 years on the Summer Solstice on the 22 December 1999. This 
    area lies on the great rift of Africa which in ancient times was called Gondwanaland 
    before the continents split. Many believe this is the place where man/woman 
    began. </font> </p>
  <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
    tree is one of the largest in Southern Africa and is 4000 years old. This 
    area of South Africa, Mpumalanga, is one of the few where the traditional 
    spiritual beliefs of the indigenous people, the Venda have survived the ravages 
    of Apartheid. It is the home of the Rain Queen who has great powers. There 
    are many sacred forests and lakes in the area and it is a landscape of exquisite 
    beauty. The area is also close to the Kruger National Park, one of the largest 
    game reserves in Africa.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The Birth of the Founders of the Mixtec People, metaphorically the 
    original human beings, from a Tree at Apoala is depicted (above) on page 37 
    of the pre-Hispanic Mixtec Codex Vindobonensis. The codices of the Mixtecs, 
    in addition to being a remarkable work of art, , provide an almost unique 
    sense of the scope of the mythic-historic vision of the people of Mesoamerica, 
    retelling Mixtec history from its primordial beginnings. Claiming descent 
    from the Feathered Serpent, the Mixtecs, who by 1350 A.D. occupied an area 
    of southern Mexico that now comprises the western section of the state of 
    Oaxaca...believe that their founding fathers were born from Trees, both a 
    metaphoric reference to their close ties to the land and to their cosmic relationship 
    to the World Axis, since the World Tree stands in the center of the cosmos 
    uniting the lower, middle, and upper worlds and thus also suggests the continuing 
    nature of the process of creation.</p>
  <p>Following the detailed interpretation of this image by Jill Furst, we see 
    a Tree with a cleft in its crown from which emerges a nude male covered with 
    red body paint. A nude female stands above him. (She is the Tree, giving birth 
    to the Son). On either side of the Tree, identified by their signs, appear 
    7 Rain of the right, holding a cutting implement in his right hand while touching 
    the Tree with his left, and 7 Eagle on the left side, holding a clawed implement 
    in one hand while similarly touching the Tree with his other hand. They seem 
    to be cutting into the trunk of the Tree, (to get at its meanings), which 
    appear to grow from a feathered carpet. A Mixtec symbol for a plain. At the 
    base of the Tree there is a Female head with an extended tongue, <font size="2">(think 
    of the Goddess Kali)</font>, a fang in the corner of her mouth, and long hair 
    with what appear to be red 'bangs,' both probably generative signs, the color 
    suggesting one of the possible colors of corn..</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><b><img src="../../UsedImages/pg000a-mandala.gif" width="411" height="640">.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Together with the male figure at the top of the Tree, this female figure 
    at the base indicated the male-female nature of the Birth Tree, a metaphor 
    similar to the male-female nature of the Aztec creator god, Ometeotl. The 
    blue tubular earplug that she wears is a male characteristic and thus suggests 
    again the dual sexuality of the Tree, as does the fact that the left side 
    of the Tree has a row of white circles--female symbols--while the right side 
    has three arrows--masculine symbols, increasing in size toward the bottom. 
    The body of the Tree itself is swollen, indicating perhaps that the offspring 
    will be removed by cutting into the 'pregnant' trunk, which is divided on 
    top by a V-shaped cleft before being separated in half vertically along the 
    center by a thin red line that thickens as it reaches the bottom. </p>
  <p>On either side of the Tree there are group of Five branches, the arrangement 
    of which strongly suggests a quincunx <img src="../../UsedImages/SquareDalets.gif" width="14" height="14"> 
    , with all its cosmic implications concerning the space-time continuum that 
    is the created world, the world into which humanity, in the persons of the 
    nude male and female, is emerging. Such an image, of course, would suggest 
    that this Tree is the World Tree at the cosmic center, and in that connection 
    the possibility of seeing this image as both an upright Tree and an inverted 
    female figure links cosmic creation to human procreation. That link is one 
    of the primary concerns of the narrative myths of human creation throughout 
    Mesoamerica since it is through procreation, the uniting of the created male 
    and female, that the process of creation becomes cyclical and continuous.&quot;
