  First Appearance in Egypt. </p>
<p>Although pagan nations as a rule were not prone to intolerance in matters of 
  religion, they were so with regard to Judaism. They were highly incensed against 
  the people which treated so contemptuously all pagan divinities and reviled 
  all that was sacred in pagan eyes. Especially embittered against the Jews were 
  the Egyptians when, through the translation of the Bible, they were informed 
  of the pitiful r&ocirc;le ascribed to their ancestors at the birth of the Jewish 
  nation. In Egypt, therefore, originated the anti-Jewish writings, and the apologetic 
  and polemical works in defense of Judaism against paganism. As early as the 
  middle of the third pre-Christian century a Theban priest named Manetho, in 
  his history of the Egyptian dynasties, written in Greek, violently attacked 
  the Jews, inventing all kinds of fables concerning their sojourn in Egypt and 
  their exodus therefrom. The substance of his fables is that a number of persons 
  suffering from leprosy had been expelled from the country by the Egyptian king 
  Amenophis (or Bocchoris, as he is sometimes called), and sent to the quarries 
  or into the wilderness. It happened that among them was a priest of Heliopolis 
  of the name of Osarsiph (Moses). This priest persuaded his companions to abandon 
  the worship of the gods of Egypt and adopt a new religion which he had elaborated. 
  Under his leadership the lepers left Egypt, and after many vicissitudes and 
  the perpetration of numerous crimes they reached the district of Jerusalem, 
  which they subdued.</p>
<p>These fables, together with those invented by Antiochus Epiphanes in connection 
  with his alleged experiences in the Temple of Jerusalem, were repeated and greatly 
  amplified by Posidonius in his history of Persia. The accusations thus brought 
  against the Jews were that they worshiped an ass in their Temple, that they 
  sacrificed annually on their altar a specially fattened Greek, and that they 
  were filled with hatred toward every other nationality, particularly the Greeks. 
  All these malevolent fictions found embodiment in the polemical treatises against 
  the Jews by Apollonius Molon, Ch&aelig;remon, Lysimachus, Apion, and others 
  (see Eusebius, &quot;Pr&aelig;paratio Evangelica,&quot; x. 19; Josephus, &quot;ContraAp.&quot; 
  ii. 7. &sect; 15), and were taken up and retailed, with sundry alterations and 
  additions, by the Roman historian Trogus Pompeius, and especially by Tacitus, 
  who, in this respect, displayed such ingenuity as to excite the envy of the 
  greatest casuists among the rabbis.</p>
<p>To the various incidents which, according to Manetho, accompanied the Exodus, 
  Tacitus traces the origin of nearly all the religious customs of the Jews. Abstinence 
  from the use of swine's flesh is explained by the fact that the swine is peculiarly 
  liable to the itch and therefore to that very disease on account of which the 
  Jews were once so severely maltreated. Frequent fasting is alleged by him to 
  have been instituted in commemoration of the starvation from which they had 
  escaped in the wilderness. Their observance of the seventh day of the week is 
  assumed to be due to their finding a restingplace on the seventh day (Tacitus, 
  &quot;Hist.&quot; v. 2 et seq.). It is not astonishing, therefore, that, thus 
  represented, the Jewish religion was looked upon by the majority of educated 
  people as a &quot;barbara superstitio&quot; (Cicero, &quot;Pro Flacco,&quot; 
  xxviii.), and that the Jewish nation was made the butt of the wit of the Roman 
  satirists Horace, Juvenal, and Martial.</p>
<p>The Hellenists.</p>
<p>To defend the Jewish religion and the Jewish race against the slanderous attacks 
  of the heathen there appeared, at various intervals, from about the second pre-Christian 
  century to the middle of the second century C.E., apologetical and polemical 
  works emphasizing the superiority of Judaism over paganism. To works of this 
  kind belong the explanation of the Mosaic law by Aristobulus of Paneas, the 
  Oracula Sibyllina, the Wisdom of Solomon, the apocalpyses, the Jewish-Hellenistic 
  writings of Alexandria (see Hellenism), especially those of Philo, and lastly 
  Josephus' &quot;Contra Apionem.&quot; The aim of all these works was the same, 
  namely, severe criticism of idolatry and vigorous arraignment of the demoralization 
  of the pagan world.</p>
<p>A new polemical element was introduced by Christianity&#151;that of the interpretation 
  of the Biblical text. Having received from Judaism its ethical principles, the 
  new religion, in order to justify its distinctive existence, asserted that it 
  had been founded to fulfil the mission of Judaism, and endeavored to prove the 
  correctness of this allegation from the Bible, the very book upon which Judaism 
  is founded. Aside from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, the first Christian 
  polemical work against the Jews was the account of the dialogue between Justin 
  Martyr and the Jew Tryphon, which took place shortly after the Bar Kokba war 
  against the Romans. The Church father endeavored to demonstrate that the prophecies 
  concerning the Messiah applied to Jesus, while the Jew met his arguments with 
  the traditional interpretation. Justin displayed great bitterness against the 
  Jews, whom he charged with immorality and with having expunged from their Bibles 
  much that was favorable to Christianity (&quot;Dial. cum Tryph.&quot; &sect;&sect; 
  72, 73, 114). These charges were repeated by the succeeding Christian polemists; 
  while that of having falsified the Scriptures in their own interests was later 
  made against both Christians and Jews by the Mohammedans. A remarkable feature 
  in Justin's dialogue is the politeness with which the disputants speak of each 
  other; at the close of the debate Jew and Christian confess that they have learned 
  much from each other and part with expressions of mutual goodwill.</p>
<p>Church Attacks.</p>
<p>More bitter in tone is the dialogue, belonging to the same period, written 
  by the converted Jew Ariston of Pella, and in which a Christian named Jason 
  and a Jew named Papiscus are alleged to have discussed the nature of Jesus. 
  Among other polemical works directed against the Jews the most noteworthy are: 
  &quot;The Canon of the Church,&quot; or &quot;Against the Judaizers,&quot; by 
  Clement of Alexandria (see Eusebius, &quot;Hist. Eccl.&quot; vi. 13); &quot;Contra 
  Celsum,&quot; by Origen; ???? ???da????, by Claudius Apollinarius; &quot;Adversus 
  Jud&aelig;os,&quot; by Tertullian; &quot;Adversus Jud&aelig;os&quot; and &quot;Testimonia,&quot; 
  by Cyprian; &quot;Demonstratio Evangelica,&quot; by Eusebius; &quot;De Incarnatione 
  Dei Verbi,&quot; by Athanasius of Alexandria; the &quot;Homilies&quot; of John 
  Chrysostom; the &quot;Hymns&quot; of Ephraem Syrus; &quot;Adversus H&aelig;reses&quot; 
  and &quot;Ancyrotus,&quot; by Epiphanius; &quot;Dialogus Christiani et Jud&aelig;i 
  de St. Trinitate,&quot; by Jerome. The main points discussed in these works 
  are the dogma of the Trinity, the abrogation of the Mosaic law, and especially 
  the Messianic mission of Jesus, which Christians endeavored to demonstrate from 
  the Old Testament. Some of the Church Fathers emphasized their arguments with 
  curses and revilings. They reproached the Jews for stiff-neckedness and hatred 
  of Christians; they were especially bitter against them for persisting in their 
  Messianic hopes. The following passage from one of Ephraem Syrus' &quot;hymns&quot; 
  against the Jews may serve as an example of the polemical attitude of the Church 
  Fathers: &quot;Jacob blessed Judah, saying, 'The scepter shall not depart from 
  Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come' [Gen. xlix. 
  10]. In this passage the Jews that perceive not search if there be a scepter 
  or an interpreter between his [Judah's] feet, for the things that are written 
  have not been fulfilled, neither have they so far met with accomplishment. But 
  if the scepter be banished and the prophet silenced, let the people of the Jews 
  be put to shame, however hardened in impudence they be.&quot;</p>
<p>Discussions in the Talmud.</p>
<p>The Jews did not remain silent, but answered their antagonists in the same 
  tone. This at least is the assertion of Jerome in the preface to his commentary 
  on the Psalms, where he says that in his time discussions between the Church 
  and the Synagogue were very frequent. He further asserts that it was considered 
  a great undertaking to enter into polemics with the Jews&#151;a proof that contests 
  often ended in favor of the latter. However, in spite of the frequency of discussions, 
  no particular Jewish polemical work of that period has survived; the only source 
  of information concerning the nature of these discussions is a number of dialogues 
  recorded in the Talmud and Midrash. These dialogues, like others between Jews 
  and pagans found in the same sources, were more in the nature of good-humored 
  raillery than of serious debate. The rabbis who excelled in these friendly passages 
  of arms with pagans, Christians, and Christian Gnostics wereJohanan ben Zakkai, 
  Gamaliel II., Joshua ben Hananiah, and Akiba. Johanan ben Zakkai answered several 
  questions of an aggressive nature put by a Roman commander as to the contradictions 
  existing between Num. iii. 22, 28, 34 and the 39th verse of the same chapter 
  (Bek. 5b) and between Ex. xxxviii. 26, 27 and Gen. i. 20, ii. 19 (?ul. 27b); 
  also as to the regulation in Ex. xxi. 29 (Yer. Sanh. 19b) and the law concerning 
  the red heifer (Pesi?. 40a).</p>
<p>Interesting are the accounts of the debates which Gamaliel, Eleazar, Joshua 
  ben Hananiah, and Akiba held with unbelievers at Rome (see Bacher, &quot;Ag. 
  Tan.&quot; i. 85). It is noteworthy that even in the time of Gamaliel the Christians 
  used as an argument against Judaism the misfortunes that had befallen Israel. 
  In discussing with Gamaliel, a &quot;min&quot; quoted Hosea v. 6 to demonstrate 
  that God had completely forsaken Israel (Yeb. 102b; Midr. Teh. to Ps. x.). A 
  similar argument was used, not in words but in gesture, by another min against 
  Joshua ben Hananiah, who answered by a sign that God's protecting hand was still 
  stretched over Israel (?ag. 5b). This took place in the palace of Hadrian, who 
  questioned Joshua as to how God created the world (Gen. R. x.); concerning the 
  angels (Gen. R. lxxviii.; Lam. R. iii. 21); as to the resurrection of the body 
  (Gen. R. xxviii.; Eccl. R. xii. 5); and in regard to the Decalogue (Pesi?. R. 
  21).</p>
<p>But rabbinical polemics assumed a more violent character when the Church, having 
  acquired political power, threw aside all reserve, and invective and abuse became 
  the favorite weapons of the assailants of Judaism. A direct attack upon Christianity 
  was made by the Palestinian amora R. Simlai. His attacks were especially directed 
  against the doctrine of the Trinity (Gen. R. viii.; Yer. Ber. ix. 11d, 12a). 
  A later Palestinian amora, R. Abbahu, refuted all the fundamental dogmas of 
  Christianity (Yal?., Gen. 47; Gen. R. xxv.; Shab. 152b). With regard to the 
  doctrine of the Trinity, Abbahu says: &quot;A thing of flesh and blood may have 
  a father, a brother, or a son to share in or dispute his sovereignty, but the 
  Lord said, 'I am the Lord thy God! I am the first'&#151;that is, I have no father&#151;'and 
  besides me there is no God'&#151;that is, I have no son&quot; (see Isa. xliv. 
  6; Ex. R. xxix.). Commenting upon Num. xxiii. 19, Abbahu says, &quot;God is 
  not a man, that he should repent; if a man say, 'I am God,' he lieth; and if 
  he say, 'I am the son of man' [Messiah], he shall repent; and if he say. 'I 
  shall go up to heaven'&#151;he may say it, but he can not perform it&quot; (Yer. 
  Ta'an. i. 1).</p>
<p>Polemics with Christians.</p>
<p>The Church Fathers who lived after Jerome knew less and less of Judaism, and 
  merely repeated the arguments that had been used by their predecessors, supplemented 
  by more or less slanderous attacks borrowed from pagan anti-Jewish writings. 
  Spain became from the sixth century a hotbed of Christian polemics against Judaism. 
  Among the numerous works written there, the oldest and the most important was 
  that of Isidorus Hispalensis. In a book entitled &quot;Contra Jud&aelig;os,&quot; 
  the Archbishop of Seville grouped all the Biblical passages that had been employed 
  by the Fathers to demonstrate the truth of Christianity. Whether learned Spanish 
  Jews took up the controversy and replied to Isidorus' arguments by counter-treatises 
  in Latin, as Gr&auml;tz believes (&quot;Gesch.&quot; v. 75 et seq.), is doubtful. 
  In Spain, as everywhere else in that period, the Jews paid little attention 
  to attacks written in Latin or Greek, which languages were not understood by 
  the masses. Moreover, the Christian dogmas of the Trinity, the Incarnation, 
  etc., seemed to them to stand in such direct contradiction to both the letter 
  and the spirit of the Old Testament that they deemed it superfluous to refute 
  them.</p>
<p>The expansion of Karaism during the ninth and tenth centuries awakened in the 
  Jews the polemical spirit. Alive to the dangers that threatened traditional 
  Judaism through the new sect, which, owing to the inertness of the Geonim of 
  the Babylonian academies, was rapidly growing, several rabbinical scholars took 
  up the study of both Biblical and secular sciences, which enabled them to advance 
  against the Christians as well as the Karaites a systematic defense of Jewish 
  beliefs. The first known polemist of that period was David ibn Merwan al-Mu?amma?, 
  who devoted the eighth and tenth chapters of his &quot;'Ishrun al-Ma?alat&quot; 
  to the refutation of Christian dogmas. He was followed by Saadia Gaon, who, 
  both in his commentaries on the Bible and in the second chapter of his philosophical 
  &quot;Emunot we-De'ot,&quot; assailed the arguments of the Church. He maintained 
  that the Jewish religious system, which allowed man to approach as nearly as 
  is possible to perfection, would always exist, and would not be replaced by 
  any other, least of all by the Christian, which transmuted mere abstractions 
  into divine personalities.</p>
<p>More aggressive was Saadia's contemporary, the Karaite Al-?ir?isani. In the 
  third treatise of his &quot;Kitab al-Anwar wal-Marakib&quot; (ch. xvi.) he says 
  that &quot;the religion of the Christians, as practised at present, has nothing 
  in common with the teachings of Jesus. It originated with Paul, who ascribed 
  divinity to Jesus and prophetic inspiration to himself. It was Paul that denied 
  the necessity of obeying the commandments and taught that religion consisted 
  in humility; and it was the Nicene Council which adopted precepts that occur 
  neither in the Law nor in the Gospels nor in the Acts of Peter and Paul.&quot; 
  Equally violent in their attacks upon Christianity were the Karaite writers 
  Japheth ben Ali and Hadassi&#151;the former in his commentaries on the Bible, 
  and the latter in his &quot;Eshkol ha-Kofer,&quot; in which the fundamental 
  dogmas of Christianity are harshly criticized. The assertion of the Christians 
  that God was born of a woman and assumed a human form in the person of Jesus 
  is considered by Hadassi to be blasphemous. Moreover, the reason given by the 
  Church that God willed the incarnation of Jesus in order to free the world from 
  its thraldom to Satan, is declared by him to be absurd; for, he asks, has the 
  world grown any better as a result of this incarnation? are there fewer murderers, 
  adulterers, etc., among the Christians than there were among the pagans?</p>
<p>Petrus Alphonsi and Jacob ben Reuben.</p>
<p>The first works wholly devoted to the refutationof Christianity appeared in 
  the second half of the twelfth century in Spain&#151;the preeminently fertile 
  source of anti-Jewish writings between the sixth and fifteenth centuries. They 
  were the outgrowth of the restless aggressiveness of the Christian clergy, who, 
  taking advantage of the irruption of fanaticism marking the period of the Crusades, 
  planned the wholesale conversion of the Jews through the medium of polemical 
  works written by converts from Judaism. These converts, instead of confining 
  themselves to the usual arguments drawn from the Old Testament, claimed to demonstrate 
  from the Haggadah that Jesus was the Messiah&#151;from the very part of rabbinical 
  literature which they most derided and abused! This new method of warfare was 
  inaugurated in Spain by Petrus Alphonsi (whose name before baptism was Moses 
  Sephardi) in his series of dialogues against the Jews, the disputants being 
  himself before and himself after conversion (Cologne, 1536; later in &quot;Bibliotheca 
  Patrum,&quot; ed. Migne, clvii. 535). To arm themselves against these attacks 
  learned Spanish Jews began to compose manuals of polemics. About a quarter of 
  a century after the composition of Judah ha-Levi's famous apologetical work, 
  the &quot;Cuzari,&quot; in which Judaism was defended against the attacks of 
  Christians, Karaites, and philosophers, Jacob ben Reuben wrote the &quot;Sefer 
  Mil?amot Adonai.&quot; This is divided into twelve chapters, and contains, besides 
  refutations of the Christian arguments drawn from the Old Testament, a thorough 
  criticism of the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, in which he points out 
  many contradictions.</p>
<p>About the same time Joseph ?im?i, also a native of Spain, wrote the &quot;Sefer 
  ha-Berit,&quot; a dialogue between a believer and an apostate. The believer 
  maintains that the truth of the religion of the Jews is attested by the morality 
  of its adherents. The Ten Commandments, at least, are observed with the utmost 
  conscientiousness. The Jews concede no divine honors to any besides God; they 
  do not perjure themselves, nor commit murder, nor rob. Jewish girls remain modestly 
  at home, while Christian girls are careless of their self-respect. Even their 
  Christian antagonists admit that the Jew practises hospitality toward his brother 
  Jew, ransoms the prisoner, clothes the naked, and feeds the hungry. The accusation 
  that the Jews exact exorbitant interest from Christians is balanced by ?im?i's 
  statement that Christians also take usurious interest, even from their fellow 
  Christians, while wealthy Jews lend money to their coreligionists without charging 
  any interest whatever.</p>
<p>Raymund Martin and Na?manides.</p>
<p>Great activity in the field of polemics was displayed by both Jews and Christians 
  in Spain in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Among the Christian works 
  of the thirteenth century the most noteworthy are the &quot;Capistrum Jud&aelig;orum&quot; 
  and the &quot;Pugio Fidei&quot; (Paris, 1651; Leipsic, 1667). In the latter 
  work, Raymund Martin endeavored to demonstrate from the Talmud, Midrash, and 
  other sources that Jesus is announced in rabbinical literature as the Messiah 
  and the son of God; that the Jewish laws, although revealed by God, were abrogated 
  by the advent of the Messiah; that the Talmudists corrupted the text of the 
  Bible, as is indicated in the &quot;Ti??un Soferim.&quot; Some of Martin's arguments 
  were used by Pablo Christiani in his disputation with Na?manides, who victoriously 
  combated them before King James and many ecclesiastical dignitaries. Both the 
  arguments and their refutation were reproduced in a special work entitled &quot;Wikkua?,&quot; 
  written by Na?manides himself. The subjects discussed were: (1) Has the Messiah 
  appeared? (2) Should the Messiah announced by the Prophets be considered as 
  a god, or as a man born of human parents? (3) Are the Jews or the Christians 
  the possessors of the true faith? A direct refutation of Raymund Martin's &quot;Pugio 
  Fidei&quot; was written by Solomon Adret, who, in view of the misuse of the 
  Haggadah by converts to Christianity, wrote also a commentary on that part of 
  the Jewish literature.</p>
<p>The production of Jewish polemical works in Spain increased with the frequency 
  of the attacks upon Judaism, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, by baptized 
  Jews. Of the latter the most renowned were: Alfonso of Valladolid (Abner of 
  Burgos), author of the anti-Jewish works &quot;Moreh ?ede?&quot; (Spanish version, 
  &quot;El Mustador&quot;) and &quot;Teshubot 'al Mil?amot Adonai&quot; (Spanish, 
  &quot;Los Batallos de Dios&quot;); Astruc Raimuch (Christian name, Dios Carne), 
  who was the author of a letter, in Hebrew, in which he endeavored to verify, 
  from the Old Testament, the doctrines of the Trinity, original sin, redemption, 
  and transubstantiation; Pablo de Santa Maria (Solomon Levi of Burgos), author 
  of a satire on the festival of Purim, addressed to Me&iuml;r ben Solomon Alguades; 
  Geronimo de Santa F&eacute; (Joshua ben Joseph al-Lorqui), who wrote the anti-Jewish 
  &quot;Tractatus Contra Perfidiam Jud&aelig;orum&quot; and &quot;De Jud&aelig;is 
  Erroribus ex Talmuth&quot; (the latter was published, under the title &quot;Hebr&aelig;omastic,&quot; 
  at Zurich, 1552; Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1602; Hamburg, n.d.; and in Bibliotheca 
  Magna Veterum Patrum, Lyons (vol. xxvi.], and Cologne, 1618).</p>
<p>Pablo de Santa Maria and Joseph ibn Vives.</p>
<p>Against the writings of these converts, the two last-named of whom organized 
  the disputation of Tortosa, held before Benedict XIII. (Pedro de Luna) in 1413, 
  there appeared a series of works which are remarkable for the aggressiveness 
  of their tone. The first of this series was the &quot;'Ezer ha-Dat&quot; of 
  Ibn Pulgar. It is divided into eight chapters (&quot;she'arim&quot;), the last 
  of which is devoted wholly to the work of Alfonso of Valladolid. To the letter 
  of Astruc Raimuch there appeared two answers, the more interesting of which 
  is that of Solomon ben Reuben Bonfed, in rimed prose. Apologizing for discussing 
  the contents of a letter not addressed to him, Bonfed minutely examines the 
  Christian dogmas and proceeds to show how irrational and untenable they are. 
  &quot;You twist and distort the Biblical text to establish the doctrine of the 
  Trinity. Had you a quaternity to prove, you would demonstrate it quite as strikingly 
  and convincingly from the Old Testament.&quot; An answer to Pablo's satire was 
  written by Joseph ibn Vives al-Lorqui. The writer expresses his astonishmentthat 
  Pablo should have changed his faith. Satirically he canvasses the various motives 
  which might have led him to take such a step&#151;desire for wealth and power, 
  the gratification of sensual longings&#151;and naively concludes that probably 
  Pablo had carefully studied Christianity and had come to the conclusion that 
  its dogmas were well founded. He (Joseph), therefore, begged Pablo to enlighten 
  him on eight specific points which seemed to warrant doubts as to the truth 
  of Christianity: (1) The mission of the Messiah announced by the Prophets was 
  to deliver Israel. Was this accomplished by Jesus? (2) It is expressly stated 
  by the Prophets that the Messiah would assemble the Jews, the descendants of 
  Abraham, and lead them out from exile. How, then, can this be applied to Jesus, 
  who came when the Jews still possessed their land? (3) It is predicted that 
  after the arrival of the Messiah, Palestine, peopled by the descendants of Jacob, 
  who would have at their head David for king, would enjoy unbroken prosperity. 
  But is there any country more desolate than that land is now? (4) After the 
  arrival of the Messiah, God, the Prophets foretold, would be recognized by the 
  whole universe. Has this been fulfilled? (5) Where is the universal peace predicted 
  for the Messianic time by the Prophets? (6) Where is the Temple, with its divine 
  service by the priests and Levites, that the Messiah was to restore, according 
  to the predictions of the Prophets? (7) Great miracles are foretold&#151;the 
  worship in Jerusalem of God by all nations; the war between Gog and Magog; etc. 
  Did these take place at the time of Jesus? (8) Did any prophet predict that 
  the Messiah would abrogate the Mosaic law? &quot;These,&quot; says Joseph ibn 
  Vives, &quot;are only a few of the numerous doubts that have been suggested 
  to me by the words of the Prophets. Much more difficult to allay are my doubts 
  concerning the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus, his intercourse with 
  his disciples and others, his miracles; but these I would discuss orally, and 
  not in writing.&quot;</p>
<p>?asdai Crescas.</p>
<p>A general work against Christianity was written in Spanish, under the title 
  &quot;Tratado&quot; (&quot;Bi??ul 'I??ere ha-No?erim&quot; in the Hebrew translation 
  of Joseph ibn Shem-?ob), by the philosopher ?asdai Crescas. In a dispassionate, 
  dignified manner he refutes on philosophical grounds the doctrines of original 
  sin, redemption, the Trinity, the incarnation, the Immaculate Conception, transubstantiation, 
  baptism, and the Messianic mission of Jesus, and attacks the Gospels. Another 
  general anti-Christian work, entitled &quot;Eben Bo?an,&quot; and modeled upon 
  the &quot;Mil?amot Adonai&quot; of Jacob ben Reuben, was written at the end 
  of the fourteenth century by Shem-?ob ben Isaac ibn Shaprut, who, in 1376, debated 
  in public at Pamplona with Cardinal Pedro de Luna, afterward Benedict XIII., 
  on the dogmas of original sin and redemption. The book is divided into fifteen 
  chapters, the last being devoted to the refutation of the work of Alfonso of 
  Valladolid against the &quot;Mil?amot Adonai&quot; of Jacob ben Reuben.</p>
<p>Of the same character as the &quot;Eben Bo?an,&quot; and of about the same 
  date, are the works written by Moses Cohen of Tordesillas and by ?ayyim ibn 
  Musa, entitled respectively &quot;'Ezer ha-Emunah&quot; and &quot;Magen wa-Roma?.&quot; 
  A masterpiece of satire upon Christian dogma is the &quot;Iggeret al-Tehi ka-Aboteka,&quot; 
  written at the beginning of the fifteenth century by Profiat Duran and addressed 
  to the baptized Jew David Bonet Bongoron. It was so skilfully composed that 
  until the appearance of Joseph ibn Shem?ob's commentary thereon Christian authors 
  believed it to be favorable to Christianity, and frequently quoted it under 
  the corrupted title &quot;Alteca Boteca&quot;; but when they perceived the real 
  character of the epistle they strove to destroy all the copies known. Associated 
  with this letter is Duran's polemic &quot;Kelimat ha-Goyim,&quot; a criticism 
  of Christian dogma, written in 1397 at the request of ?asdai Crescas, to whom 
  it is dedicated. It was much used by his kinsman Simon ben ?ema? Duran in his 
  attacks upon Christianity, especially in those which concern the abrogation 
  of the Mosaic law and are made in his commentary on the sayings of the Fathers 
  (&quot;Magen Abot,&quot; published separately under the title &quot;?eshet u-Magen,&quot; 
  Leghorn, 1785; reedited by M. Steinschneider, Berlin, 1881).</p>
<p>In France.</p>
<p>The earliest anti-Jewish writings in France date from the first half of the 
  ninth century. Between 825 and 840 Agobard, Bishop of Lyons, wrote three anti-Jewish 
  epistles, among which was one entitled &quot;De Insolentia Jud&aelig;orum,&quot; 
  and one &quot;Concerning the Superstitions of the Jews&quot; (&quot;Agobardi 
  Opera,&quot; ed. Migne, civ.). The author endeavors, in the latter work, to 
  show from various Biblical passages that the society of Jews should be avoided 
  even more than association with pagans, since Jews are the opponents of Christianity. 
  He recounts the judgments passed by the Church Fathers upon the Jews, the restrictive 
  measures taken against them by different councils, their superstitions, and 
  their persistent refusal to believe in Jesus. Agobard's successor in the diocese 
  of Lyons, Bishop Amolo, also wrote against the Jews, denouncing their superstitions, 
  calling attention to the invidious expressions used by them to designate the 
  Apostles and the Gospels, and exposing the fictitious character of their arguments 
  in defense of their Messianic hopes (&quot;Contra Jud&aelig;os,&quot; ed. Migne, 
  cxvi.).</p>
<p>However, works like those of Agobard and Amolo were very rare in France in 
  the tenth and eleventh centuries; they began to multiply only after the Crusades, 
  when every priest considered himself charged with the duty of saving Jewish 
  souls. The many anti-Jewish works of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries include: 
  &quot;De Incarnatione, Adversus Jud&aelig;os,&quot; by Guilbert; &quot;Annulus 
  seu Dialogus Christiani et Jud&aelig;i de Fidei Sacramentis,&quot; by Rupert; 
  &quot;Tractatus Adversus Jud&aelig;orum Inveteratam Duritiem,&quot; by Pierre 
  le Venerable; &quot;Contra Jud&aelig;orum&quot; (anonymous); &quot;Liber Contra 
  Perfidiam Jud&aelig;orum,&quot; by Pierre of Blois; &quot;Altercatio Jud&aelig;i 
  de Fide Christiana,&quot; by Gilbert Crepin; &quot;De Messia Ejusque Adventu 
  Pr&aelig;terito,&quot; by Nicolas de Lyra. From the thirteenth century polemical 
  works in French began to appear, as, for instance, &quot;De la Disputation de 
  la Synagogue et de la Sainte Eglise&quot; (Jubinal, &quot;Myst&egrave;res du 
  XV? Si&egrave;cle,&quot; ii. 404-408); &quot;La Disputation du Juyf et du Crestian&quot; 
  (&quot;Histoire Litt&eacute;raire de France,&quot; xxiii. 217).On the part of 
  the Jews there appeared in northern France a collection of replies made &quot;to 
  infidels and Christians&quot; by several members of the Official family, especially 
  by Joseph the Zealot (who is credited with the redaction of the Hebrew version, 
  entitled &quot;Wikkua?,&quot; of the disputation of 1240 between Nicholas Donin 
  and four representatives of the Jews), Jehiel of Paris, Judah ben David of Melun, 
  Samuel ben Solomon, and Moses de Coucy. The characteristic features of these 
  controversies are the absence of fanaticism in the clerical disputants and the 
  freedom of speech of the Jews, who do not content themselves with standing upon 
  the defensive, but often attack their opponents, not with dialectics, but with 
  clever repartee. The following may serve as an example: Nathan ben Meshullam 
  was asked to give a reason for the duration of the present exile, while that 
  of Babylon, which was inflicted upon the Jews as a punishment for the worst 
  of crimes, idolatry, lasted only seventy years. He answered: &quot;Because in 
  the time of the First Temple the Jews made stone images of Astarte and other 
  statues which could not last for long; while in the time of the Second Temple 
  they deified one of themselves, Jesus, to whom they applied many prophecies, 
  thus creating a durable idol which attracted many worshipers. The gravity of 
  the fault, therefore, called for a corresponding severity in the punishment.&quot;</p>
<p>In Provence.</p>
<p>Regular treatises in defense of Judaism against the attacks of Christianity 
  began to appear in southern France. The most important of these were: the &quot;Sefer 
  ha-Berit&quot; of Joseph ?im?i (see above); the &quot;Ma?azi? ha-Emunah&quot; 
  of Mordecai ben Josiphiah; the &quot;Mil?emet Mi?wah&quot; of Me&iuml;r ben 
  Simon of Narbonne; and three works by Isaac ben Nathan&#151;a refutation of 
  the arguments contained in the epistle of the fictitious Samuel of Morocco (who 
  endeavored to demonstrate from the Bible the Messiahship of Jesus); &quot;Toka?at 
  Ma?'eh,&quot; against Geronimo de Santa F&eacute;; and &quot;Mib?ar Yi??a?,&quot; 
  a general attack upon Christianity. An interesting polemical work was written 
  in France at the end of the eighteenth century by Isaac Lopez, under the title 
  &quot;Kur Ma?ref ha-Emunot u-Mar'eh ha-Emet.&quot; It is divided into twelve 
  chapters or &quot;gates,&quot; and contains, besides a refutation of the Christian 
  arguments drawn from the Old Testament, a thorough criticism of the Gospels 
  and the Acts of the Apostles, in which the author points out many contradictions 
  and false statements. He accuses Paul of hypocrisy for prohibiting in one country 
  what he allowed in another. Thus, for instance, to the Christians of Rome, who 
  clung to the Mosaic law, he did not dare to recommend the abrogation of circumcision 
  and other commandments: &quot;For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep 
  the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.&quot; 
  &quot;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish 
  the law&quot; (Rom. ii. 25, iii. 31). But to the Galatians he said: &quot;Behold, 
  I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. 
  For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, he is a debtor to do the 
  whole law&quot; (Gal. v. 2, 3). &quot;If this is the case,&quot; asks Lopez, 
  &quot;why did not Paul, who was circumcised, observe the Mosaic law? Then, again, 
  why did he cause his disciple Timothy to be circumcised?&quot; To the Hebrews 
  Paul said, &quot;He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or 
  three witnesses&quot; (Heb. x. 28); but to his disciple Titus he wrote, &quot;But 
  avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about 
  the law; for they are unprofitable and vain&quot; (Titus iii. 9).</p>
<p>In Italy.</p>
<p>Although the &quot;Disputatio Christianorum et Jud&aelig;orum Olim Rom&aelig; 
  Habita Coram Imperatore Constantino&quot; (Mayence, 1544) is founded on a fiction, 
  there is no doubt that religious controversies between Christians and Jews in 
  Italy were held as early as the pontificate of Boniface IV. (608-615). Alcuin 
  (735-804) relates that while he was in Pavia a disputation took place between 
  a Jew named Julius and Peter of Pisa. Yet in spite of the frequency of religious 
  controversies anti-Jewish writings were very rare in Italy before the Crusades; 
  the only work of the kind known to belong to the eleventh century was that of 
  Damiani, entitled &quot;Antilogus Contra Jud&aelig;os,&quot; in which he sought, 
  by means of numerous passages from the Old Testament, such as those relating 
  to the Creation, the building of the tower of Babel, the triple priestly benediction, 
  the thrice-repeated &quot;Holy,&quot; and the Messianic passages, to establish 
  the Christian doctrines of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus (Migne, &quot;Patrologia,&quot; 
  2d series, 1853; comp. Vogelstein and Rieger, &quot;Gesch. der Juden in Rom,&quot; 
  i. 26 et seq.).</p>
<p>But from the time of the pontificate of Innocent III. anti-Jewish writings 
  in Italy, as elsewhere, began to multiply. To the earlier calumny that the Talmud 
  contained blasphemies against Christianity, there was added, after the twelfth 
  century, the accusation that the Jews used Christian blood for ritual purposes. 
  About the same time also there appeared the charge that the Jews pierce the 
  consecrated host until blood flows. The first Jewish polemical writer in Italy 
  seems to have been Moses of Salerno, who, between 1225 and 1240, composed &quot;Ma'amar 
  ha-Emunah&quot; and &quot;?a'anot,&quot; in both of which he attacked the fundamental 
  dogmas of Christianity. They were followed by other polemics, the most important 
  of which are the &quot;Mil?amot Adonai&quot; (or &quot;She'elot u-Teshubot,&quot; 
  or &quot;'Edut Adonai Ne'emanah&quot;), by Solomon ben Jekuthiel; the &quot;Magen 
  Abraham&quot; (or &quot;Wikkua?&quot;), by Abraham Farissol; and the &quot;Hassagot 
  'al Sifre ha-Shillu?im,&quot; by Brieli.</p>
<p>In Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>The shamefully oppressive economic and political conditions under which the 
  Jews labored in Germany and in Austria during the Middle Ages rendered them 
  regardless of the flood of anti-Jewish writings with which those countries became 
  inundated. It was not until the fifteenth century that a polemical work against 
  Christianity appeared in Austria. This was written by Lipmann M&uuml;lhausen, 
  under the title &quot;Sefer ha-Ni??a?on,&quot; and it consisted of 354 paragraphs, 
  the last eight of which contained a dispute which took place between the author 
  and a convert named Peter. Lipmann quotes in his work 346 passages from the 
  Old Testament, upon which hisargument against Christianity is based. Very characteristic 
  is his objection to the divinity of Jesus. &quot;If really God had willed to 
  descend upon the earth in the form of a man, He, in His omnipotence, would have 
  found means to do so without degrading Himself to be born of a woman.&quot; 
  The Gospel itself, according to Lipmann, speaks against the assumption that 
  Jesus was born of a virgin, since, with the purpose of showing that he was a 
  descendant of David, it gives the genealogy of Joseph, the husband of Mary.</p>
<p>Among the numerous objections raised by Lipmann to the doctrine of redemption, 
  mention may be made of the following: &quot;Why,&quot; asks he, &quot;did God 
  cause Jesus to be born after thousands of generations had lived and died, and 
  thus allow pious men to suffer damnation for a fault which they had not committed? 
  Was it necessary that Christ should be born of Mary only, and were not Sarah, 
  Miriam, Abigail, Hulda, and others equally worthy of this favor? Then, again, 
  if mankind be redeemed through Christ, and the original sin be forgiven through 
  his crucifixion, why is the earth still laboring under the Lord's curse: 'In 
  sorrow thou shalt bring forth children.' 'Thorns also and thistles shall it 
  bring forth to thee' [Gen. iii. 16, 18]? Were there invisible curses which have 
  been removed, while the visible were allowed to remain?&quot; As may be readily 
  surmised, the &quot;Sefer-ha-Ni??a?on&quot; called forth a number of replies 
  from Christians. Of these there were published Wilhelm Schickard's &quot;Triumphator 
  Vapulans, sive Refutatio Blasphemi Libri Hebraici&quot; (T&uuml;bingen, 1629), 
  Stephen Gerlow's &quot;Disputatio Contra Lipmanni Nizzachon&quot; (K&ouml;nigsberg, 
  1647), and Christian Schotan's &quot;Anti-Lipmanniana&quot; (Franeker, 1659). 
  In 1615 there appeared also in Germany a polemical work in Jud&aelig;o-German 
  entitled &quot;Der J&uuml;dische Theriak&quot;; it was composed by Solomon Offenhausen, 
  and was directed against the anti-Jewish &quot;Schlangenbalg&quot; of the convert 
  Samuel Brenz.</p>
<p>Isaac Troki's &quot;?izzu? Emunah.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jewish work which more than any other aroused the antagonism of Christian 
  writers was the &quot;?izzu? Emunah&quot; of the Karaite Isaac Troki, which 
  was written in Poland and translated into Latin, German, Spanish, and English. 
  It occupies two volumes and is subdivided into ninety-nine chapters. The book 
  begins by demonstrating that Jesus was not the Messiah predicted by the Prophets. 
  &quot;This,&quot; says the author, &quot;is evident (1) from his pedigree, (2) 
  from his acts, (3) from the period in which he lived, and (4) from the fact 
  that during his existence the promises that related to the advent of the expected 
  Messiah were not fulfilled.&quot; His argument on these points is as follows: 
  (1) Jesus' pedigree: Without discussing the question of the relationship of 
  Joseph to David, which is very doubtful, one may ask what has Jesus to do with 
  Joseph, who was not his father? (2) Hisacts: According to Matt. x. 34, Jesus 
  said, &quot;Think not that I come to make peace on earth; I come not to send 
  peace but the sword, and to set a man at variance against his father, and the 
  daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.&quot; 
  On the other hand, Holy Writ attributes to the true and expected Messiah actions 
  contrary to those of Jesus. (3) The period of his existence: It is evident that 
  Jesus did not come at the time foretold by the Prophets, for they predicted 
  the advent of Messiah at the latter days (Isa. ii. 2). (4) The fulfilment of 
  the Messianic promises: All the Prophets predicted that at the advent of the 
  Messiah peace and justice would reign in the world, not only among men but even 
  among the animals; yet there is not one sincere Christian who would claim that 
  this has been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Among Isaac Troki's objections to the divinity of Jesus the following may be 
  mentioned: The Christian who opposes Judaism must believe that the Jews tormented 
  and crucified Jesus either with his will or against his will. If with his will, 
  then the Jews had ample sanction for what they did. Besides, if Jesus was really 
  willing to meet such a fate, what cause was there for complaint and affliction? 
  And why did he pray in the manner related in Matt. xxvi. 39? On the other hand, 
  if it be assumed that the crucifixion was against his will, how then can he 
  be regarded as God&#151;he, who was unable to resist the power of those who 
  brought him to the cross? How could one who had not the power to save his own 
  life be held as the Savior of all mankind? (ch. xlvii.).</p>
<p>In the last chapter Isaac quotes Rev. xxii. 18, and asks how Christians could 
  consistently make changes of such a glaring nature; for the change of the Sabbath 
  from the seventh to the first day of the week was not authorized by Jesus or 
  any of his disciples; and the partaking of the blood and flesh of a strangled 
  beast is a palpable infringement of the dictates of the Apostles.</p>
<p>By Maranos.</p>
<p>A series of apologetic and polemical works, written in Spanish and Portuguese 
  by scholarly refugees from Spain and Portugal, appeared in the sixteenth and 
  seventeenth centuries, in Holland and in some places in Italy. Of these the 
  most important are: &quot;Sobre el Capitulo 53 de Ezaya e autros Textos de Sagrada 
  Escritura&quot; by Montalto; &quot;Livro Fayto . . . em Que Mostra a Verdad 
  de Diversos Textos e Cazas, Que Aleg&atilde;o as Gentilidades para Confirmar 
  Suas Seictas,&quot; by the same author; &quot;Tractado de la Verdad de la Ley&quot; 
  (Hebrew transl. by Isaac Gomez de Gora, under the title &quot;Torat Mosheh&quot;), 
  by Saul Levi Morteira; &quot;Tratado da Calumnia,&quot; by Na?mios de Castro; 
  &quot;Fuenta Clara, las Excellencias y Calumnias de los Hebreos,&quot; by Isaac 
  Cardoso; &quot;Prevenciones Divinas Contra la Vance Idolatria de las Gentes&quot; 
  and &quot;Explica&ccedil;&atilde;o Paraphrastica Sobre o Capitulo 53 de Propheta 
  Isahias,&quot; by Balthazar Orobio de Castro; &quot;Fortalazzo&quot; (Hebrew 
  transl. by Marco Luzzatto), by Abraham Peregrino.</p>
<p>Though much less violent than the Christian anti-Jewish writings, an extensive 
  anti-Jewish polemical literature has been produced by Mohammedan scholars. The 
  subject-matter of this literature is closely connected with the earlier attacks 
  upon Judaism found in the Koran and the tradition (&quot;?adith&quot;), the 
  most debated charge being that of having falsified certain portions of the Holy 
  Scriptures and omitted others. Among the examples of falsification is the Biblical 
  account of the sacrifice of Abraham, in which, according to the Mohammedans, 
  thename of Isaac was substituted for that of Ishmael. The passages omitted contained 
  the predictions regarding the advent of Mohammed and his mission to all mankind. 
  A common point for controversy also was the question of the abrogation of the 
  divine laws&#151;the Sabbath law, the dietary laws, and other Biblical commandments.</p>
<p>In Islam.</p>
<p>On the Jewish part very little was written against Islam, and besides occasional 
  attacks scattered through the Biblical commentaries of the Rabbinites and Karaites, 
  and the philosophical works of Saadia, Abraham ibn Daud, Judah ha-Levi, Moses 
  ben Maimon, and others, Jewish literature contains but two productions of any 
  extent that are devoted to an attack upon Islam: the &quot;Ma'amar 'al Yishmael&quot; 
  of Solomon ben Adret, refuting the attacks upon the Bible by Abu Mohammed ibn 
  ?azm, and the &quot;?eshet u-Magen&quot; of Simon Duran.</p>
