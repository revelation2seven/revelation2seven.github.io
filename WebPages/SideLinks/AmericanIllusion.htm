  Thoughts While Passing The Point Of No Return<br>

<p><br>
  Sometimes when we're traveling, we get so engrossed in our own conversations 
  we fail to see significant things. We speed by these emotional landmarks without 
  noticing them. It may be the very thing we've been looking for all our lives, 
  but we miss it for a distracting remark that happens to turn our heads in the 
  wrong direction at that very moment.</p>
<p> Think of what constitutes the point of no return. The days that follow ignorant 
  and unwise decisions are always filled with grief and remorse. Sometimes, in 
  the distance between the moment where we passed it and the spot where we realize 
  we've passed it, the epiphany dawns on us &quot; there is no turning back, despite 
  all our fondest wishing and hoping, despite all our teary promises to do better 
  next time. Real life has no reset button. Then comes that hollow time, with 
  its aluminized applause of silence, when understanding crashes in on us. Some 
  mistakes, like the death of your mother or your son, simply cannot be corrected. 
  Sometimes, in this life, there is simply no going back. <br>
</p>
<p>So it is with the American dream, lying crushed in the bleeding dust of official 
  lies presented as eternal truths by neatly dressed young people trying in vain 
  to speak English correctly in front of mobile television cameras, saying things 
  like &quot;the American people support what has been done in Iraq&quot; and 
  trying to show their spontaneous sincerity as the scripted words slither from 
  their painted lips. <br>
</p>
<p>America has been twisted from an example of hope for the world into an armed 
  robber intent on fleecing everyone it meets. Just recently, America has changed 
  the world from a place of hope to a place of fear. We pass by these significant 
  events as the newsreel of our memories unfolds before us. We show appropriate 
  horror at the mangled bodies of people we never knew, then go on about our business 
  &quot; to the mall for those birthday presents meant for people we hardly know, 
  to work on time to meet the daily shift quota, or to our homes to retreat from 
  the daily assault of debilitating images that assail us by using whatever substance 
  pleases us at the moment. So many events we try to pass by and forget. Some 
  can't, but most do. <br>
</p>
<p>In the days following these events, we try to rationalize that some mistakes 
  can be corrected: we can go to court and demand a recount for an election that 
  has been so obviously stolen; we can catch the perpetrators of a stunningly 
  horrific crime and try them in a court of law in accordance with the finest 
  traditions of democratic justice; we can appeal to the better natures of elected 
  officials who pass laws without even reading what's on the paper; we can take 
  to the streets to protest decisions to drop nuclear weapons on peasants far 
  away; or we can point out to anyone who'll listen that our leaders are lying 
  about everything they say. <br>
  But in the days after that, we learn to our shocked dismay that the courts are 
  closed to people without flashy pedigrees, that elected officials seem not to 
  want to catch the villains who perpetrated a shocking mass murder, that legislators 
  only really listen to representatives of large companies who can fund their 
  vacation homes, that large protests are really great social events that accomplish 
  nothing, and that precious few people really care whether our leaders are lying 
  or not, as long as we have our homes, our paychecks, and our cold beer and warm 
  beds. <br>
</p>
<p>Most fail to perceive that if you fail to adequately protect what you have 
  now, chances are good that you won't have it for very long. I'm talking about 
  the future here, although you probably didn't realize it. Listen, can you remember 
  that sound you heard when you passed the point of no return. No, of course not. 
  You were busy. Talking about something else. Since the turning of the millennium, 
  we have passed by four events that have changed the consciousness of our nation 
  and the world forever and irrevocably. <br>
</p>
<p>1. The stolen election of the year 2000, in which the surreptitious denial 
  of voting rights to tens of thousands of people of color and manipulation of 
  computerized voting systems turned the vote count in favor of fascism, turned 
  America into a police state. Few then were prescient enough to have predicted 
  democracy would soon die, but it has. <br>
</p>
<p>Now there's no going back. The deed is done. The Constitution is nullified. 
  Habeas corpus is gone for the first time in 800 years. The police can come into 
  your home at any time for any reason. People can be executed without legitimate 
  trials. All as a result of a fixed vote. We should have seen it coming. But 
  we were talking, and the moment passed by. Now, no amount of second-guessing 
  can turn back the clock. Just look at the political opposition, acting as if 
  nothing really serious has happened, that they can fix the difficulties with 
  a few pieces of legislation. And still America slumbers. <br>
</p>
<p>But there is no going back. Democracy died when a bill was passed by those 
  who didn't even read it. The new American way. Goosestepping in silence. And 
  all across the political spectrum, the phony functionaries who grovel for our 
  votes (and who will ignore us when they have them) act as if this shameful occurrence 
  was normal. Perhaps it IS normal in a society of treasonous pigs with no scruples, 
  which is apparently what America has become. Just a gaggle of dishonest accountants 
  who don't really care where the numbers come from. <br>
</p>
<p>2. The mass murder of many thousands of people in New York City, Washington, 
  D.C., and western Pennsylvania was blamed on Arab terrorists minutes after it 
  happened, yet all the top officials insisted during those tear-stained days 
  that they had no premonition such a monstrous event could even happen. <br>
</p>
<p>Do you understand how those two thoughts do not and cannot co-exist in the 
  same logical space? And if they don't, and you do understand, you also understand 
  that your entire sociopolitical paradigm was shattered that day, because you 
  know 9/11 was the handiwork of the rich manipulators who run our society, a 
  hard-hearted ruse with which to plunder Arab treasures to the robotic applause 
  of the drugged-out and brain-dead American populace. <br>
</p>
<p>3. America dropped radioactive bunker buster bombs on defenseless peasants 
  in Afghanistan, leaving them to twitch in the dust as their children developed 
  horrific red tumors on their heads. This was billed a direct response to capture 
  the alleged perpetrator of the 9/11 horror. Yet when the alleged perpetrator 
  was offered up for trial in a neutral country, the U.S. ignored him and continued 
  bombing. And it turns out the war in Afghanistan was planned long before 9/11. 
  How can you launch a war that was planned before the crime was committed, and 
  then insist the war was in response to the crime? Did we miss all this? Were 
  we talking about something else when all this happened? <br>
</p>
<p>4. Now America can bomb anyone it wants to for any reason. The reasons don't 
  have to be the truth, or even grounded in reality. They can be total fantasy. 
  This is the scenario we are now witnessing in Iraq, where even proven presidential 
  lies barely raise eyebrows and most agree that Iraq needed to be bombed because 
  the president and the TV anchors said so. What was it we were doing when this 
  became a logical action? What trip were we taking when we missed that point 
  that honesty was no longer necessary for doing business in the world? And once 
  they decided they could kill all those innocent prisoners at Guantanamo without 
  real trials, where we going then? What was the sound of the Constitution being 
  ridiculed by federal judges and taken away forever? Did you hear it? What did 
  it sound like? <br>
</p>
<p>Was it like T. S. Eliot's &quot;not with a bang, but with a whimper&quot;? 
  Right after all those wonderful millennium fireworks celebrations, we came to 
  a fork in the road, only almost nobody noticed, because we were all too busy 
  having so much fun and congratulating ourselves about what a wonderful world 
  we had. Since that magical moment, we have been travelling full speed down the 
  wrong road, with most of us still pretending that everything's OK, that when 
  we wake up in the morning, things will be as they always have been, the stock 
  market will rise, certain alluring items at the store will be on sale, that 
  our jobs will be there and we'll always have plenty of gas in our cars. What 
  was it we were talking about when these events happened? What did we think about 
  them? What did we do about them? What will you be talking about when you pass 
  the point of no return? Baseball? Dietary supplements? Social obligations? <br>
</p>
<p>We're going full speed down a road of no return. We took a wrong turn at the 
  millennium fork. Plenty of people noticed, but nobody said anything. We were 
  all making too much money, all having too much fun. Had we been a realistic, 
  functional society &quot; one that cast our focus on the health and maintenance 
  of our lives and our world rather than one that seeks to escape from our responsibilities 
  because we are so afraid of death &quot; we could have learned plenty from those 
  four post-millenium events that have so profoundly changed our world for the 
  worse <br>
</p>
<p>Were we not led in the wrong direction by the pathetic prostitutes we see on 
  the TV screens every night, we could have found out that Katherine Harris and 
  Jeb Bush conspired to deprive over 90,000 people of their legitimate right to 
  vote. I'm not saying any of the subsequent events would have changed if Al Gore 
  had been the president (after all, Bill Clinton bombed the hell out of Yugoslavia 
  at the behest of the International Monetary Fund, and the murderous masquerades 
  in Waco and Oklahoma City were not exactly good advertisements for an open, 
  honest government), but it doesn't seem as likely that Gore would have rammed 
  the Patriot Act down our throats, despite the fact that it was written by Democrats, 
  or bombed New York City on the basis of Dick Cheney's think-tank report. Who 
  knows? Maybe he would have. The people in OKC sure think he might have. <br>
</p>
<p>The great lesson that has been missed by the stifling of the investigation 
  into the World Trade Center disaster is the opportunity to see a continuity 
  of manipulative aggression in the foreign policy of the United States throughout 
  the 20th Century. I mean, the situation now is not that much different than 
  it was in the 1890s when a stock market crash was engineered by rich industrialists, 
  and then a new grand plan of imperialism was undertaken by U.S. presidents that 
  resulted in major carnage in the Philippines, Cuba and even Hawaii that rivals 
  in dishonest insincerity what has recently taken place in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
  Had there been a legitimate and independent investigation into the horror of 
  9/11, more people could have seen that the land of the free and the home of 
  the brave has been provoking wars for profit around the world throughout the 
  20th Century, and that even the U.S. motivation for participation in World Wars 
  I and II are subject to alternative interpretations that clearly reveal the 
  main cause of them was manipulative profit-seeking from Wall Street and Washington. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>A truly legitimate investigation into the grand deception of what is called 
  9/11 might also have revealed that it doesn't really matter who is president 
  &quot; that the tyranny and the murder goes on no matter who is president, because 
  that's the way it has always been in America. A real investigation into 9/11 
  might just have allowed us the opportunity to at least hope for a humane world, 
  and possibly work toward one. A real investigation would have enabled us to 
  see, perhaps, that American capitalism engineered by behind-the-scenes billionaires, 
  funding both the Bolsheviks and Hitler, has caused all the wars of the 20th 
  Century. <br>
</p>
<p>But now the cat is out of the bag for all the world to see. Naked and vicious 
  power, with nothing &quot; secular or sacred &quot; able to stand in its way. 
  No reason needed to use it, only an impulse toward gluttony by a sufficient 
  number of godless petronazis mouthing religious phrases to keep the evangelical 
  zombies lulled ecstatically in their apocalyptic aspirations. <br>
</p>
<p>As one commentator said the other day, the neocon conspiracy that has grabbed 
  control of the United States and its military might is now much more dangerous 
  than Hitler's Third Reich or the Soviet Union's Red Menace ever were, in part 
  because there is no one to stop America from turning the whole world into a 
  radioactive wasteland like the one that now exists in Iraq, but also because 
  there is no voice of freedom anywhere in the world able to stand up and oppose 
  the American Zionist propaganda machine that trumpets is new, horrid messages 
  that twist the truth and obscure the atrocities. Like &quot;freedom is economic 
  slavery&quot; and &quot;democracy is a one-party system where all opposition 
  is treason.&quot; The irony is that the rich patricians uttering these sadistic 
  slogans are the ones who are the real traitors to the people of the world, and 
  everything human and holy. <br>
</p>
<p>There was a time, not too long ago (I'm thinking '60s or '70s here), when idealism 
  could have prevailed, where the noble nuances of selflessness and concern for 
  others could have determined the future we have chosen for ourselves. But corporate 
  fascism belittled and marginalized such quaint sentiments as inferior to naked 
  profits and sophisticated selfishness, and now we are travelling down a road 
  on which there are no U-turns. Although it happened very recently, we are well 
  past the point of no return, and the road not taken will forever haunt us in 
  our dreams, in each needlessly dead body we see sacrificed on the evil highway 
  of pure profit. <br>
</p>
<p>What was it we were talking about when all this happened, and how important 
  does it seem to us now, now that we can no longer turn back around, and make 
  all those needlessly dead people live again? And we teach our children that 
  stealing money from the dead is all we need to make us feel good. Rejoice, ye 
  faithful, this is the new American way. Surely, this is the point of no return. 
  We passed it some time ago. What was it you were saying when we passed it? <br>
