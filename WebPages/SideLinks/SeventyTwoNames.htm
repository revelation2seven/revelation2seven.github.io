<p align="center">Section on the Name of 72,<br>
  from Shorshei HaShemoth, by Rabbi Moshe Zacuto z&quot;l (1625-1697),<br>
  translated by Tim Woodruff &copy; 2002, all rights reserved.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
  The Name of 72 comes from the verses &quot;Vayissa [And he moved],&quot; Vayavo 
  [And it came],&quot; and &quot;Vayet [And he stretched out]&quot; [Exodus 14:19-21], 
  and they are in Hesed, Gevurah, and Tifereth.</p>
<p>The angels utilize and receive from the Name of 72, and also the power of each 
  Name of the 72 Names. Therefore I wrote each angel beneath each Name of the 
  72 Names.</p>
<p>[Ed. - Wherever it says &quot;the secret of the Name,&quot; it indicates the 
  gematria of the Name; wherever it says &quot;the Gate of the Name,&quot; it 
  indicates the exchange of the letters using the Atbash cipher (Aleph = Tav, 
  Beth = Shin, etc.); wherever it says &quot;the vitality of the Name,&quot; it 
  indicates the letters used in the middle of the filling of the Name's individual 
  letters when these are spelled out; wherever it says, &quot;the way of the Name,&quot; 
  it indicates the letters used at the end of the filling of the Name's individual 
  letters when these are spelled out; wherever it says, &quot;the permutation 
  of the Name,&quot; it sometimes indicates half of the Name (by gematria), and 
  sometimes indicates the doubling of the Name (by gematria), or the doubling 
  of the double; wherever it says, &quot;the weight of the Name,&quot; it indicates 
  the gematria of the Name times six, because a word of three letters is a &quot;house&quot; 
  that builds six &quot;houses&quot; through permutation (v. Sefer Yetzirah 4:12).]</p>

<p>Demav - the sixty-fifth Name [DM&quot;B = 46].<br>
  The secret of the Name is G-d [Elohey, ALH&quot;Y = 46] of the World, &quot;The 
  ancient G-d [ALH&quot;Y = 46] is a refuge&quot; [Deuteronomy 33:27]. The permutation 
  of the double is &quot;with the King&quot; [bemelekh, BML&quot;K = 92], and 
  its secret is the Fear [pachad, PCh&quot;D = 92] of G-d. The permutation of 
  half of DM&quot;B [= 46], its secret is ChY&quot;H [chayah = 23], which is known 
  to be the grade of the Name of Israel.<br>
  The way of the Name is ThM&quot;Th [= 840], &quot;It is a gift [matat, MTh&quot;Th 
  = 840] of G-d&quot; [Ecclesiastes 3:13], and its secret is &quot;You let them 
  drink [ThShQ&quot;M = 840] at Your refreshing stream&quot; [Psalms 36:9] - understand.<br>

  I had planned a day of vengeance [NQ&quot;M = 190]&quot; [Isaiah 63:4]. Moshe 
  our father, peace be upon him, also spoke this Name, &quot;Avenge [neqom, NQ&quot;M 
  = 190] the Israelite people on the Midianites&quot; [Numbers 31:2]. The beginning 
  letters of the verse are NN&quot;B YM&quot;H A&quot;Th A&quot;A' - the explanation: 
  NN&quot;B [= 102], its secret is &quot;our G-d&quot; [Eloheynu, ALHYN&quot;V 
  = 102]; YM&quot;H [= 55], its secret is &quot;the sea&quot; [hayam, HY&quot;M

  reached.<br>
  The vitality of the Name is YV&quot;V [= 22], whose secret is &quot;Let us delight

  with fury [A&quot;P = 81]&quot; [Habbakuk 3:12].<br>
  Under its dominion are three officers, called chiefs: Orniel, Yuriel, A'rtashiel.</p>

<p>Reah - the sixty-ninth Name [RA&quot;H = 206]. Its angel is ShRNYAL.<br>

  over all the treasuries, and over the treasuries of hail [BR&quot;D = 206] from 
  which the hailstones were generated that hung and stood above Joshua son of 
  Nun [v. Joshua 10:11]. Again, its secret is &quot;plague&quot; [dever, DB&quot;R 
  = 206], for from its spirit and from its knowledge came the very terrible plague 
  upon Egypt, and it is written, &quot;Pestilence [dever, DB&quot;R = 206] marches 
  before Him&quot; [Habbakuk 3:5], in the time to come.<br>
  The vitality of the Name is the Name YL&quot;A [= 41], whose secret is YVH&quot;K

  The permutation of the Name is 216 [RY&quot;V] bundles of sheaves [ALMY&quot;N 
  HALMY&quot;N = 267]; 216 [RY&quot;V] is the light of Chesed, and Grace [Rachamim, 
  i.e. Tifereth] is the bundles of sheaves, whose secret is &quot;fine gold&quot; 
  [paz, P&quot;Z = 87], whose secret is &quot;The L-rd is my strength [azi, A'Z&quot;Y 
  = 87] and my song&quot; [Exodus 15:2]. All is Grace and Mercy because of the

  safe, for he knows My Name [ShM&quot;Y = 350]&quot; [Psalms 91:14], and it is 
  said, &quot;Thus they shall link My Name [ShM&quot;Y = 350] with the people 
  [benei, BN&quot;Y = ben yod, B&quot;N Y' = 52 + 10] of Israel, and I will bless 
  them&quot; [Numbers 6:27]. The beginning letters [of the word ShM&quot;Y] are 
  Shmua'l, Metatron, Yehoel.<br>
  The weight of the Name is ShY&quot;B [= 312], and its secret is &quot;Renew

  [cf. Exodus 4:22, et. al.], and it is the source of prophecy, &quot;So [K&quot;H

<p>Mum - the seventy-second Name [MV&quot;M = 86]. Its angel is A'ZRYHV, and again 
  it has three angels, TzRNYAL, DLYAL, MLKhYAL.<br>

  bless us&quot; [Psalms 67:2], etc.; &quot;G-d [ALHY&quot;M = 86] is our refuge 
  and stronghold&quot; [Psalms 46:2], etc. In the section Bereshith [Genesis 1], 
  you will find 32 Elohims, to allude to the Beth [B' = 2] of &quot;in the beginning&quot; 
  [Genesis 1:1] and the Lamed [L' = 30] of &quot;before all Israel&quot; [Deuteronomy

  MV&quot;M [= 86], and it is said, &quot;I am the L-RD, I have not changed&quot; 
  [Malachi 3:6].<br>
  If you calculate the final Mem [= 600, Th&quot;R], the secret of the Name is 
  &quot;exalted&quot; [tarum, ThRV&quot;M = 646], and his horn will be exalted 
  [ThRV&quot;M = 646] in Your salvation, and its secret is (&quot;and Your crown&quot;

<p>From The Alpha and the Omega - Introduction <br>
  by Jim A. Cornwell, Copyright &copy; 1995, all rights reserved<br>
  The Names of God<br>
  Revelation 19:12 &quot;His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were 
  many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.&quot; 
</p>
<p> So strong is the power of the spoken word, that the mighty four-letter name 
  of God, the Tetragrammaton -- IHVH is never pronounced by devout Hebrews. The 
  name is usually substituted for by another four-letter name, ADNI, which is 
  pronounced Adonai and means Lord. The true pronunciation of IHVH is known to 
  very few, as it is believed to be a great secret, and &quot;He who can rightly 
  pronounce it, causeth heaven and earth to tremble, for it is the name which 
  rusheth through the universe.&quot; IHVH is commonly spelled out as Jehovah. 
</p>
<p> The intrinsic meaning of the Tetragrammaton -- IHVH -- is &quot;to be,&quot; 
  and it is a symbol of existence. It also represents the four cardinal points, 
  the four elements, (fire, air, water, and earth), and the four worlds of the 
  Kabbalists. </p>
<p> The Name may be transposed in twelve different ways, all of which mean &quot;to 
  be.&quot; The twelve transpositions are known as the &quot;twelve banners of 
  the mighty name,&quot; and are said to represent the twelve signs of the Zodiac. 
  The twelve simple letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. </p>
<p></p>
<p> God also has three other four-letter names:<br>
  AHIH (existence), ADNI (Lord), and ALGA this one is a Notarikon version (Atoh 
  Gebor Leolahm Adonai) which means (Thou art mighty forever, O Lord). The similarities 
  between IHVH (Jehovah) and AHIH (Eheih) are very marked. The letter He (archetype 
  of universal life) is the second and fourth character in both names. AHIH (Eheih) 
  is the unmanifested cosmic principle, God before the Creation, while IHVH is 
  the manifested cosmic principle, the Creation itself. </p>
<p> Another powerful name of God, is the Schemhamphoras, or the Divided Name, 
  which is hidden in the Book of Exodus, chapter 14, verses 19, 20, and 21. Each 
  verse is composed of seventy-two letters (in the original Hebrew). If one writes 
  these three verses' one above the other, the first from right to left, the second 
  from left to right, and the third from right to left, one would get seventy-two 
  columns of three-letter names of God. The seventy-two names are divided into 
  four columns of eighteen names each. Each of the four columns falls under the 
  aegis of one of the letters of the Tetragrammaton, IHVH. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> The following are a list of the Hebrew names for the above: these could also 
  be the names of seventy-two angels of Jacob&#146;s ladder, or the seventy-two
