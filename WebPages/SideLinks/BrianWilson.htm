<p align="center">What the Flag Means To Me<br>

<p align="left">I was probably seven years old before it really sunk in that everybody 
  in my town was not celebrating my birthday on July 4. It was an exciting day 
  with parades, picnics, fireworks and, in my case, special birthday parties and 
  gifts. I lived much of my young life with the extra boost of having been born 
  on the day that our earliest political framers signed the Declaration of Independence, 
  an historical act of defiance against monarchial colonial rule from distant 
  England. I remember proudly carrying the U.S. American flag in one of the July 
  4th parades in my small, agricultural town in upstate New York. And for years 
  I felt goosebumps looking at Old Glory waving in the breeze during the playing 
  of the national anthem or as it passed by in a parade. How lucky I was to have 
  been born in the greatest country in the history of the world, and blessed by 
  God to boot. Such a blessing, such a deal! </p>
<p>It wasn't until many years later, while reading an issue of the armed forces 
  newspaper Stars and Stripes in Vietnam, that I began thinking and feeling differently 
  about the flag and what it represents. There was a story about an arrest for 
  flag burning somewhere in the United States. I had recently experienced the 
  horror of seeing numerous bodies of young women and children that were burned 
  alive in a small Delta village devastated by napalm. I imagined that since the 
  pilots had &quot;successfully&quot; hit their targets, they were feeling good 
  and probably had received glowing reports that would bode well in their military 
  record for promotions. I wondered why it was okay to burn innocent human beings 
  10,000 miles from my home town, but not okay to burn a piece of cloth that was 
  symbolic of the country that had horribly napalmed those villagers. Something 
  was terribly wrong with the Cold War rhetoric of fighting communism that made 
  me question what our nation stood for. There was a grand lie, an American myth, 
  that was being fraudulently preserved under the cloak of our flag. </p>
<p>It took me years to process this clear cognitive dissonance between the rhetoric 
  of my cultural teachings and the reality of my own personal experiences. I had 
  to accept that, either there was serious distortion in how I was interpreting 
  my personal realities, or the cultural rhetoric was terribly distorted. Hmm. 
  A dilemma! If I accepted the former, I could relax and feel good about being 
  an &quot;American.&quot; If I accepted the latter, I would experience a serious 
  identity crisis, perhaps a nervous breakdown. But no matter how hard I tried, 
  I could not ignore what my own conscience was continually telling me. </p>
<p>I began a serious reflection that included careful study of U.S. and world 
  history. When I was a teenager living near Seneca Indian reservations in western 
  New York State I occasionally heard Seneca acquaintances utter &quot;jokes&quot; 
  about how the &quot;White man speaks with forked tongue.&quot; We thought it 
  funny at the time. But then I discovered how my country really was founded. 
  There were hundreds of nations comprised of millions of human beings--yes, human 
  beings--living throughout the land before our European ancestors arrived here 
  in the 1600s. The U.S. government signed over 400 treaties with various Indigenous 
  nations and violated every one of them. And over time these original peoples 
  were systematically eliminated in what amounted to the first genuine American 
  holocaust. </p>
<p>When I reread the Declaration of Independence I noted words I hadn't been aware 
  of before: &quot;He [the King of Great Britain] has excited domestic insurrections 
  amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, 
  the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished 
  destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.&quot; Honest history reveals 
  that the very land upon which our founding fathers began this new experiment 
  in freedom had been taken by violence and deceit, ironically using the same 
  diabolical methods the framers accused of those already living here. It became 
  obvious after extensive reading that my European ancestors did not believe that 
  Indigenous Americans were human beings worthy of respect, but despicable, non-human 
  creatures, worthy only of extermination. The pre-Columbus population of Indigenous 
  in the Western Hemisphere is estimated to have been at least 100 million (8-12 
  million north of the Rio Grande). By 1900 this population had been reduced to 
  about 5 percent of its former size. An Indigenous friend of mine, a Seneca man 
  who had served the U.S. military in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, and then 
  after retiring, discovered his ancestral roots as a native American, once remarked 
  to me: &quot;I call the American flag 'Old Gory,' the red representing the blood, 
  and the white, the bones, of my murdered ancestors.&quot; </p>
<p>When adding to our first holocaust the damage done to African cultures through 
  forcefully seizing human beings to be slaves in order to build our early agricultural 
  and industrial base, and the carnage from nearly 300 U.S. overt military and 
  thousands of covert interventions in the Twentieth Century to acquire access 
  to markets and resources on our selfish terms, we see there are actually three 
  holocausts that have enabled the &quot;glorious American civilization&quot; 
  to be what it is today. It is now estimated that Africa lost 50 million of its 
  population to the slave trade, at least two-thirds of whom were killed resisting 
  capture or died during the horrors of transit; an estimated 20 to 30 million 
  people in the Third World have been killed as a result of U.S. interventions. 
  Note that when other peoples all over the globe have attempted to emulate the 
  spirit of our Declaration of Independence (a proclamation of self-determination), 
  such as Vietnam explicitly did in 1945, our government not only has turned a 
  deaf ear, but has done everything in its power short of dropping Atomic bombs 
  to destroy their efforts to obtain independence. This is the foundation upon 
  which we have built &quot;America.&quot; Quite the karma! </p>
<p>The founding of our Republic was conducted in secrecy by an upper class who 
  insisted on a strong national government that could assure a successful but 
  forceful clearing of western lands, enabling the safe settlement and economic 
  development of previously inhabited Indigenous territory. Our Founding Fathers 
  did not represent the common people. Some historians believe that if the Constitution 
  itself had been subjected to a genuine vote of all the people it would have 
  been resoundly defeated. Subsequently, what evolved is a political system run 
  by plutocrats who perpetuate an economic system that protects the interests 
  of those who finance their campaigns (a form of bribery). The U.S. government 
  is a democracy in name only. Never have we had a government that seriously addresses 
  the plight of the people, whether it be workers, minorities, women, the poor, 
  etc. Whatever has been achieved in terms of rights and benefits for these constituencies, 
  i.e., the people, has been struggled for against substantial repression, and 
  the constant threat the gains will be subsequently lost. Intense pressures are 
  applied by the selfish oligarchy which seeks ever increased profits, rarely, 
  if ever, considering the expense to the health of the majority of people, their 
  local cultures, and the ecology. </p>
<p>What the West calls capitalism is nothing like what Adam Smith had in mind 
  with his views of decentralized networks of small entrepreneurs working in harmony 
  with the needs and forces of others in their own communities. What we have is 
  a savage system of centrally institutionalized greed that is unable to generalize 
  an equitable way of life for the majority of people here in the U.S., or in 
  the rest of the world. It requires incredible exploitation of human and other 
  natural resources all over the globe with the forcible protection of military 
  and paramilitary forces financed or sanctioned by governments. It thrives on 
  its own sinister version of welfare where the public financially guarantees--through 
  tax loopholes, subsidies, contracts, and outright bailouts--the profitable success 
  of the major corporations and financial institutions, especially, but not exclusively, 
  in the military-industrial complex. Additionally, our monopoly capitalism defines 
  efficiency by totally ignoring the true costs of its production and distribution. 
  It conveniently forgets the huge ecological and human exhaustion costs (both 
  being our true wealth). If these costs were included, the system would be finished 
  in a second. The reality, upon honest examination, is that the economic system 
  we call capitalism, now neoliberal, global capitalism, is cruelly based on a 
  very fraudulent set of assumptions that justify massive exploitation. The reality, 
  upon honest examination, is that our political system was founded, and has been 
  maintained to this very day by substantive plutocracy, not democracy. </p>
<p>So when I see the flag and think of the Declaration of Independence, instead 
  of the United States of America, I see the United Corporations of America; I 
  see the blood and bones of people all over the globe who have been dehumanized, 
  then exterminated by its imperialism; and I see a symbol that represents a monstrous 
  lie maintained by excessive, deadly force. It makes me feel sick, and ashamed. 
  And I know that my opinions being expressed here will not be popular, even among 
  some of my closest friends. But I cannot ignore the reality as I now understand 
  it. I believe we are living one of the most incredible lies in history, covered 
  over by one of the most successful campaigns of public rhetoric, ignoring empirical 
  reality. It is truly amazing! I hope that one day we will end our willful ignorance 
  and be able to see our transgressions, and beg, on our knees, for forgiveness, 
  and then wail as we begin to feel the incredible pain and anguish we have caused 
  the world as well as our own bodies, minds, souls, and culture.<br>
