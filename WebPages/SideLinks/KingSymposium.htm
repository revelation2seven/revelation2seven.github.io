  <p><font size="+1">Dr. Calvin O. Butts disarmed me, and gave me a lesson about 
    judging too soon (in this instance the insincerities and apostasies of the 
    American liberal establishment). During the introduction, watching Reverend 
    Butts so-pridefully-it-seemed accepting these accolades, images and words 
    kept spinning through my mind. Just as the most noted Jewish intellectuals 
    were still playing the Holocaust card and ever exploiting the idea of anti-Semitism 
    (<i>ever learning, ever writing, ever lecturing, ever receiving honors and 
    rewards, but never coming to the knowledge of the truth</i>), using them to 
    justify not only their own privileged places at the top of the political, 
    religious and academic order of things, but the very existence of the Zionist 
    state itself, so here was the creme of the Black intelligentsia still capitalizing 
    on <i>the Dream</i>, with his <i>Eyes </i>still<i> on the Prize</i>--the prize 
    he (and so few others) has so obviously already won, the American Prize...</font></p>

    because they were not...</font></i><font size="+1">(Luke 2:16-18).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And then, building upon these texts, Reverend Butts (waxing 
  comical at first--warming to his subject--but eloquently serious in the end), 
  went on to preach the most direct and meaningful sermon I have heard from any 
  pulpit concerning the events of September 11, 2001. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The congregation was in his hands as he spoke of a cameo appearance 
  he was to make in the Ric Burns PBS documentary on New York City, but of being 
  initially <i>insulted </i>when he heard Burns say that New York City <i>is a 
  city that greed built</i>. &quot;Greed? That was my city he was talking about. 
  I grew up there. Who wants their home town, no matter how big or small it is, 
  badmouthed?...Well I wanted to see myself in that documentary--I have a little 
  vain streak in me you know--but I turned it off.&quot; (Laughter). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">&quot;The more I thought about it, however&quot;...(a rhetorical 
  way of getting the congregation to think about what he was about to say), &quot;I 
  mean, those towers! How did they get built?&quot; Throughout his sermon he repeated 
  the words: &quot;I see New York City as a metaphor for America, a microcosm 
  of the entire nation.&quot; He spoke of the &quot;rat race&quot; in and out 
  of the city each day, millions of people pouring in and out of the city every 
  working day in the singular pursuit of money--money and things...&quot;money, 
  money, money...and the material things and pleasures that money can buy.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">&quot;On the Plain of Shinar they built One Tower,&quot; he 
  said, &quot;but here in America they built Two Towers...not to God's glory but 
  to their own. Two Towers, mind you, so that they--the rich and powerful men 
  of this nation--could make a name for <i>themselves</i>.&quot; </font><font size="+1">Calvin 
  Butts referred to those towers as two immense Phallic symbols reaching into 
  the heavens, symbols of man's exaltation of &quot;self&quot; and ultimate defiance 
  of God.</font></p>

  how much energy and resources have to be brought together in one place, how 
  much determination and resolve it required to accomplish such a feat?...How? 
  They were of one language. They spoke the same language...THE LANGUAGE OF 'GREED'...THE 
  LANGUAGE OF 'ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">&quot;There was once J. P. Morgan, and that was

    <b>Corporate Mergers Skyrocket<br>
    by Michael Renner<br>
    Vital Signs<br>
    Worldwatch Institute<br>
    2000</b></p>
  <p><b>The trend toward corporate consolidation gained significant momentum IN 
    1999, WHEN THE VALUE OF WORLDWIDE MERGERS REACHED A NEW RECORD of $3.4 trillion 
    (in 1998 dollars). This was an astonishing 40-percent increase from the previous 
    record of $2.5 trillion--established only in 1998. Since 1980, the annual 
    value of mergers has risen 100-fold, reaching a cumulative $15 trillion. In 
    1999, more than 32,000 deals were announced, triple the number of 10 years 
    earlier and more than 30 times as many as in 1981. In a sign of globalization 
    gathering pace, the dollar value of mergers across national boundaries rose 
    even more strongly than that of all mergers, almost doubling to $1.1 trillion 
    in 1999. While cross-border mergers were typically below 20 percent of the 
    value of all mergers in the early 1980s, today they represent 33 percent. 
    The number of cross-border deals valued at more than $1 billion rose from 
    35 in 1997 to 89 in 1998.</b></p>
  <p><b>Mergers are held to increase shareholder value and boost corporate efficiency. 
    But evidence suggests that these expectations are not always fulfilled. From 
    a broader vantage point, there is concern that mergers and a proliferation 
    of strategic partnerships among corporations are leading to a greater degree 
    of market concentration in many industries, giving a few producers an undue 
    amount of influence on the market. Market power often also translates into 
    political influence. </b></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg296.gif" width="500" height="619"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>LARGE CORPORATIONS HAVE ENORMOUS INFLUENCE ON HOW BILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORK 
    AND LIVE. In recent years, for instance, concern has risen about the push 
    by biotech firms to manipulate the genetic makeup of food and plants, about 
    media giants' control over the way we learn about global events, about highly 
    mobile companies weakening labor's bargaining position, about civic culture 
    coming under the sway of corporate advertisements and sponsorships, and about 
    industry lobbyists influencing the outcome of elections and legislation. ULTIMATELY, 
    CONSOLIDATION TRENDS may </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(there 
    is no &quot;may&quot; about it)</font><b> THREATEN DEMOCRATIC NORMS, LABOR 
    STANDARDS, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ENVIRIONMENTAL QUALITY. </b></p>
  <p><b>THE CURRENT MERGER FRENZY is such that yesterday's record-shattering deal 
    looks almost quaint today. In 1998, the biggest announced acquisition--EXXON's 
    purchase of MOBIL--was valued at $86 billion.&quot; In 1999, THE TELEPHONE 
    GIANT MCI WORLDCOM proposed to buy its rival SPRINT for $108 billion. Early 
    2000 saw the announcement of the two largest combinations ever--between AMERICA 
    ONLINE and TIME-WARNER for $165 billion, and between Britain's Vodafone Airtouch 
    and Germany's Mannesmann for $183 billion. The merger record of 1999 is on 
    track to be surpassed in 2000: the total value of announced deals just 11 
    weeks into the year is $864 billion--closing in on the total for 1995. </b></p>
  <p><b>Recent deals have established NEW BEHEMOTHS in such diverse parts of the 
    economy as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals oil, automobiles, and paper. 
    In 1999, one third of the worldwide merger value was concentrated in just 
    three sectors. The telecommunications industry, with $569 billion, was by 
    far the leader, followed by commercial banking ($377 billion) and radio and 
    television broadcasting ($246 billion). Among cross-border deals, telecommunications, 
    too, is the leader, followed by the metals, oil and gas, and chemical industries. 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Liberalization and privatization of telecommunications assets in many 
    countries have triggered AN ENDLESS SERIES OF TAKEOVERS. For example, if the 
    announced merger between MCI Worldcom and Sprint is approved, it will be the 
    culmination of 18 successive mergers over the past two decades, 11 of which 
    were MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR COMBINATIONS. </b></p>
  <p><b>The media industry is being thoroughly reshaped by the growing integration 
    of entertainment, news, publishing, and communications companies and by the 
    rapid rise of the Internet and digital communications. JUST NINE CORPORATE 
    GIANTS NOW DOMINATE THE WORLD MEDIA MARKET.</b></p>
  <p><b>Companies in Western Europe and North America are by far the most active 
    in acquiring firms elsewhere; firms from all other regions of the world, including 
    even Japan, are comparatively small players. Developing-country enterprises 
    play a minuscule role as buyers, although they have been important takeover 
    targets during the 1990s. </b></p>
  <p><b>Thomson Financial Securities Data reports that $487 billion worth of mergers, 
    or 14 percent of the total in 1999, involved so-called hostile takeovers--offers 
    that had initially been rejected by the target company. At more than four 
    times the value of hostile deals during the previous peak year, 1988, this 
    marked yet another record for 1999. CORPORATE RAIDING HAD BEEN RARE OUTSIDE 
    THE UNITED STATES, but is now spreading elsewhere: more than one third of 
    the dollar volume of all European mergers in 1999 involved hostile acquisitions. 
    Mergers in the 1980s were largely financed through 'leveraged buy-outs'--borrowed 
    money--and acquired firms were often cannibalized. Today, mergers involve 
    stock swaps rather than cash transactions. BLOATED STOCK MARKET VALUES HAVE 
    MADE DEALS OF PREVIOUSLY UNIMAGINED SIZE POSSIBLE. </b></p>
  <p><b>But the current cascade of mergers is also sustained by the broad trend 
    toward privatization of state-owned companies and public infrastructure, deregulation, 
    and the liberalization of trade, investments, and capital markets. IN AN AGE 
    OF GLOBALIZATION, THE SIZE AND GEOGRAPHICAL REACH OF A FIRM ARE SEEN AS EVER 
    MORE CRUCIAL TO SUCCESS. Increasingly, firms either achieve this objective 
    by observing others, or they get swallowed up by competitors.</b></p>
  <p><b>Cross-border mergers have been the main driving force of foreign direct 
    investment (FDI) in recent years. This means that a considerable portion of 
    private capital flows goes simply to changing ownership of existing factories 
    and other businesses. While some acquisitions imply a long-term investment 
    commitment, others may be little more than a prelude to asset-stripping--retaining 
    the most valuable parts of a company and closing or selling off other parts. 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The tidal wave of cross-border mergers implies that transnational corporations 
    (TNCs), PARTICULARLY THE LARGEST ONES, WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THEIR ALREADY 
    STRONG ROLE IN WORLD TRADE. Intra-firm trade--that is, the flow of raw materials, 
    components, finished goods, and services from a subsidiary of a corporation 
    in one country to another subsidiary in a second country--now accounts for 
    roughly a third of world trade. The proportion rises to two thirds if what 
    the World Investment Report 1999 calls &quot;arm's-length trade associated 
    with TNCs&quot; is included. </b></p>
  <p><b>Through mergers and other FDI flows, transnational corporations can supply 
    domestic markets in numerous countries through a growing web of local factories 
    and offices. At $11 trillion in 1998, sales of foreign affiliates of transnationals 
    easily surpassed total world exports of $6.7 trillion. During the past decade, 
    these sales have grown more strongly than either total world output or world 
    trade. </b></p>

  <p align="center"><b>By CARLOTTA GALL</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>ITAWI, Afghanistan, Dec. 7, 2003&#151; Their embroidered 
    caps, shredded with shrapnel, lay in the dust beside half a dozen children's 
    rubber galoshes and caked pools of blood. Nine children died here Saturday 
    morning in a United States air strike, and were still lying in the dust when 
    American soldiers flew in by helicopter to investigate the consequences three 
    hours later, villagers and U.S. soldiers at the scene said today. </b><b>A 
    young man of 25 was also killed, they said, while the intended target, a Taliban 
    suspect, appeared to have gotten away.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The boys were playing marbles,&quot; said one man, thrusting forward 
    a gnarled hand with three chipped glass marbles he had picked up the from 
    the dust. Seven boys, ages 8 to 12, were playing marbles in front of a house, 
    and two girls ages 9 and 10 were fetching water from the stream alongside 
    when the planes struck at 10:45 a.m.</b></p>
  <p><b>Their rockets made 30 to 40 small craters in the ground around where the 
    children died. The young man, their uncle, rushed toward the stream after 
    the first plane struck and was cut down beside them, his mother said. Shocked 
    and angry, villagers were mourning their children in this small hamlet some 
    300 kilometers south of Kabul in southeastern Afghanistan this afternoon, 
    the men gathered in the open-air mosque and the women weeping inside the houses.</b></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation and weeping, 
    and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, 
    because they are not...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew 2:18).</font></p>
  <p><b>As the men showed journalists and a government delegation around the scene 
    of the attack, they wondered aloud why the Americans attacked so indiscriminately 
    when searching for just one man and why innocent civilians had to die when 
    the man was not even in the village.</b></p>
  <p><b>The attack, which does not seem to have netted the suspected Taliban member 
    it was aiming at, raises questions as to the effectiveness of using air power 
    to catch fugitive Taliban and Al Qaeda sheltering in villages. President Hamid 
    Karzai of Afghanistan said he was &quot;profoundly shocked&quot; at the deaths 
    of nine children and said he had sent a delegation to investigate and offer 
    help to the families, a presidential spokesman said. In an interview with 
    the BBC he said future operations should be better coordinated with the Afghan 
    government so it should never happen again.</b></p>
  <p><b>Villagers and local officials echoed his sentiments. &quot;They bombed 
    this place and said we were giving sanctuary to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, 
    but there are no Taliban or Al Qaeda here,&quot; said Abdul Majid Farooqi, 
    the school principal and local mullah. &quot;We all support the government.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>American officials have said the attack was aimed at a member of the Taliban, 
    Mullah Wazir, who is believed to be behind a number of attacks on aid workers 
    in the region and construction engineers working on the major United States 
    project to rebuild the Kabul-Kandahar road. The United States ambassador to 
    Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said at a news conference today in Kabul THAT 
    MULLAH WAZIR WAS A KNOWN &quot;FINANCIER, ORGANIZER AND FACILITATOR OF ATTACKS 
    ON AID WORKERS AND WORKERS ON THE HIGHWAYS.&quot;... </b></p>
  <p><b>Villagers said Mullah Wazir did indeed live in the village but that he 
    had left two weeks ago with his whole family after an earlier air strike when 
    planes fired into the field. American soldiers pointed out Mullah Wazir's 
    house, which they had searched, but was otherwise untouched by the bombardment. 
    The children had been killed just 10 yards in front of the house by the stream.</b></p>
  <p><b>Hundreds of civilians have been killed in American air strikes in the 
    two years since the United States launched its campaign against the Taliban 
    and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After several disastrous raids last year when 
    planes bombed officials loyal to the Karzai government and in one incident 
    killed some 48 civilians in a raid on a wedding party in July last year, the 
    United States military had appeared to restrict its air assaults to more precise 
    attacks only when groups of militants were engaged by coalition troops.</b></p>
  <p><b>Nevertheless, Saturday's attack was at least the fourth this year in which 
    civilians have been killed or injured. Eleven members of one family were killed 
    in April in Paktika in eastern Afghanistan when American forces called in 
    air strikes on a group of militants escaping toward the Pakistani border and 
    a bomb landed on a house. Eight people, including women and children, were 
    killed in a village in the northern province of Nuristan on Oct. 30 when American 
    planes bombarded their village at night. The military acknowledged the April 
    bombing but has not confirmed responsibility for the Nuristan bombing.</b></p>
  <p><b>This time American soldiers were sent into Pitawi within three hours of 
    the air strike to assess the scene, Capt. Jorge Cordeiro, the company commander, 
    said in an interview at the scene. Standing amid fruit trees in an orchard 
    slightly away from the village, he spoke as a Chinook helicopter covered by 
    an Apache came in to land. &quot;We came in to secure the site and do an assessment 
    and allow for another team to come in and do the investigation,&quot; he said.</b></p>
  <p><b>The investigation team came in today and had left by midafternoon, he 
    said. The rest of the company were ready to pull out too, he said, after his 
    men had exploded a number of mines and bullets found in the village. The soldiers 
    had also detained four armed men but said they thought they would be released 
    since it appeared they had come from a nearby village to find out what had 
    happened and assist the villagers.</b></p>
  <p><b>There was no further official statement from the military pending the 
    results of the investigation, but Mr. Khalilzad and Afghan interior minister 
    Ahmed Ali Jalali both said today that Mullah Wazir had been killed. Yet on 
    the ground in the village it did not appear to be the case. </b></p>
  <p><b>Captain Cordeiro confirmed that they had found nine children killed and 
    one adult, who could have been the suspect targeted, he said. But he admitted 
    that they had not talked to villagers or actually identified the dead man.</b></p>
  <p><b>Villagers, including the man's mother, said the dead man was Abdul Muhammad, 
    25, who had just returned from Iran 10 days ago, where he had been working 
    for three years digging wells. She had finally arranged his wedding and he 
    had returned for his engagement party, which was just five days away. </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;I was so pleased to have my son back. And now he is dead,&quot; 
    said his mother, Guldana, standing outside her simple home. She had lost not 
    only her son but her two granddaughters, Bibi Toara, 10, and Bibi Tamama, 
    9, who were fetching water by the stream and were killed instantly.</b></p>
  <p><b>Two brothers in the village, Sarwar Khan and Hamidullah, lost three children 
    between them, they said. &quot;The Americans are all the time making these 
    mistakes,&quot; said Mr. Khan, who lost his two sons, Faizullah, 8, and Obeidullah, 
    10. &quot;What kind of Al Qaeda are they? Look at their little shoes and hats. 
    Are they terrorists?&quot;</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>WE MAY HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING SINCE KING'S VIETNAM SERMON</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>By William Rasberry</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>WASHINGTON__&quot;Every man knows enough Bible to fit his own pistol,&quot; 
    my late father used to say: Or, I might amend, enough King. Dad's observation 
    dates to the time when debaters would turn to the Scriptures for support of 
    their point of view--whatever it happened to be--on the issue of the day. 
    My amendment acknowledges that I may be doing something similar when I use 
    the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous 1967 &quot;Declaration of Independence 
    from the War in Vietnam&quot; as a commentary on America's presence in Iraq.</b></p>
  <p><b>King, remember, was known until that 1967 sermon at New York's Riverside 
    Church primarily as a civil rights leader. His Nobel Peace Prize, awarded 
    three years earlier, was largely in recognition of his nonviolent advocacy 
    on behalf of black and poor Americans. And he was roundly criticized by those, 
    black and white, conservative and liberal, who thought he was overstepping 
    his boundaries and jeapordizing the cause of civil rights.</b></p>
  <p><b>King himself thought, as many of us do now, that it was the war that put 
    the interests of the poor in jeapordy. Listen:</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><i>A few years ago there was a shining moment...It seemed as if there 
      was a real promise of hope for the poor--both black and white--through the 
      Poverty Program. Then came the buildup in Vietnam, and I watched the program 
      broken and eviscerated as if some idle political plaything of a society 
      gone mad on war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary 
      funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as Vietnam continued 
      to draw men and skills and money like some DEMONIC destructive suction tube.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Even the harshest critics of the war in Iraq acknowledge that Saddam Hussein 
    was a tyrant and a brute. But they also believe that our government made military 
    action against him seem unavoidable when it might have been avoided. King 
    saw the same thing--can it really be?--37 years ago when, as he put it, &quot;America 
    has spoken of peace and built up its forces...speaking of aggression as it 
    drops thousands of bombs on a poor, weak, nation more than 8,000 miles from 
    its shores.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>King--even with a sympathetic audience--found it necessary to distinguish 
    between opposition to the war and opposition to our troops:</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><i>I should make it clear that while I have tried here to give a voice 
      to the voiceless in Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who 
      are called enemy, I am as deeply concerned about our own troops there as 
      anything else. For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to is 
      not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies 
      face each other and seek to destroy. We are adding cynacism to the process 
      of death, for our troops must know after a short period there that none 
      of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Some critics of America's behavior in Iraq have expressed the fear that 
    we may, however inadvertently, be fomenting a latter-day holy war. King quoted 
    a letter from a Vietnamese Buddhist who complained that the Americans were 
    &quot;forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies...It is curious 
    that the Americans, who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military 
    vistory, do not realize that in the process they are incurring deep psychological 
    and political defeat. The image of America will never be the image of revolution, 
    freedom and democracy, but the image of violence and militarism.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>And finally, King's sermon has a word for those who think it silly, weak 
    and maybe even unpatriotic to wonder why so many people in certain parts of 
    the world hate <i>US</i> so.</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><i>How can they trust us when now we charge them with violence...while 
      we pour new new weapons of death into their land?...Here is the true meaning 
      and value of compassion and nonviolence--when it helps us to see the enemy's 
      point of view, to hear his questions, to know of his assessment or ourselves. 
      For from his view we may indeed see the basic weakness of our own condition, 
      and if we are mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of 
      the brothers who are called the opposition.</i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>IF I AM MORE HOPEFUL NOW THAN KING WAS THEN, THERE'S GOOD REASON. HE SPOKE

    <b>WAR PARTY PUTS SYRIA IN ITS SIGHTS</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>by Jim Lobe</b></p>
  <p><b>January 25, 2004 </b></p>
  <p><b>Retired Gen. Anthony Zinni began warning that ousting Saddam Hussein, 
    let alone invading Iraq, risked destabilizing the entire Middle East back 
    in 1998, when he led U.S. Central Command and testified against the Iraq Liberation 
    Act that made &quot;regime change&quot; official US policy. And just six months 
    before the actual invasion last March, in October 2002, he told the annual 
    Fletcher Conference on National Security Strategy, &quot;we are about to do 
    something that will ignite a fuse in this region that we will rue the day 
    we ever started.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>While President George W. Bush tried hard to project a sense of confidence 
    and control concerning Iraq and the larger Middle East in his State of the 
    Union Address on Tuesday, a careful look at the news this week suggested that 
    Zinni's fears were not unfounded. Talk of possible civil war in Iraq finally 
    reached the front pages of US newspapers, while reports that at least some 
    elements of the administration are pushing for military action against Hezbollah 
    in Lebanon and targets in Syria surfaced for the first time since last summer.</b></p>
  <p><b>At the same time, by omitting any reference to the Israeli-Palestinian 
    conflict in his speech, Bush indicated he has no intention of seriously pressing 
    either party toward a cease-fire, let alone peace talks designed to meet the 
    goal of the &quot;roadmap&quot;: securing Palestinian statehood by next year. 
    In other words, the outlook for the region between the eastern Mediterranean 
    and Iran 10 months after US troops launched their drive from Kuwait to Iraq 
    is for more &#150; possibly a lot more &#150; turbulence.</b></p>
  <p><b>Long before this week, demands by Iraqi Kurds for virtually total autonomy, 
    including the retention of their own &quot;pesh merga&quot; force, in a new, 
    federal Iraq have been drawing grim warnings from neighboring Turkey, Iran 
    and Syria &#150; which all have large and restive Kurdish populations. But 
    last week's rejection &#150; by Iraq's most powerful Shiite cleric, Ayatollah 
    Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani &#150; of a US plan to transfer sovereignty to 
    a transitional government that will not be directly elected by the Iraqi people, 
    has brought home the message that whatever progress Washington is making in 
    suppressing the insurgency in the &quot;Sunni Triangle&quot; of central Iraq 
    could very quickly be overwhelmed by the lack of a credible political strategy.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;CIA officers in Iraq are warning that the country may be on a path 
    to civil war,&quot; was the lead sentence in a front-page article in the Philadelphia 
    InquirerThursday. The article, written by veteran Knight-Ridder reporters 
    who have consistently led the mainstream media in uncovering secrets the Bush 
    administration would rather not have exposed, quoted senior US officials as 
    saying that failure to satisfy demands for direct elections could spark an 
    uprising by much of the heretofore friendly Shi'a population, who make up 
    60 percent or more of Iraq's 24 million people.</b></p>
  <p><b>That message was underscored by the mobilization of hundreds of thousands 
    of Shiites in protest demonstrations over the past week &#150; a display of 
    discipline and organization that clearly surprised the administration. If 
    the Shi'a turn against the U.S.-led coalition, &quot;this would be like losing 
    the Buddhists in Vietnam,&quot; Anthony Cordesman, a Mideast expert at the 
    conservative Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) here, told 
    the Financial Times Friday, referring to the US war against the Asian country 
    in the 1960s and '70s. &quot;It would mean losing the war.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>However unattractive that option seems, holding the direct elections Sistani 
    is demanding &#150; which almost certainly would bring a Shi'a-dominated government 
    to power &#150; is also considered distinctly dangerous. &quot;We can't simply 
    walk away and let the Shi'a dictate the shape of the new government,&quot; 
    warned John Hamre, deputy defense secretary under Bush's predecessor Bill 
    Clinton, earlier this week, &quot;because that will likely unleash a civil 
    war in Iraq.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Hamre, who as CSIS' president led an independent task force to Iraq last 
    August to review the situation at Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld's behest, 
    described the administration as &quot;caught in a box.&quot; A box with more 
    than a few sharp edges, too. Sistani and his followers have made clear that 
    they, as well as the Sunnis, strongly oppose a federal system that would give 
    Kurds the autonomy they seek, particularly if the northerners were to claim 
    oil-rich Kirkuk as theirs. Deadly clashes between the pesh merga and Turkomen 
    and Arab residents in Kirkuk and parts of the northern Sunni Triangle have 
    been a constant, albeit under-reported, feature of the landscape for months, 
    but they might only be a warm-up to a much bigger struggle, unless the administration 
    prevails on the Kurds to stand down. The fact that Washington has permitted 
    the pesh merga to retain its arms has not helped matters.</b></p>
  <p><b>Meanwhile, tensions between Shi'as and Sunnis, who have dominated Iraqi 
    governments since independence, have mounted steadily since Dec. 9, when three 
    Sunnis were killed in an explosion at a Baghdad mosque. While Washington says 
    it agrees with Sistani that direct elections are best, it insists there is 
    not enough time to hold them before the scheduled Jun. 30 turnover, a date 
    that was decided more out of concern for Bush's reelection campaign than by 
    a commitment to build viable democratic institutions in Iraq.</b></p>
  <p><b>If the complicated &quot;caucus&quot; system that Washington proposed 
    in November will not work, the administration appears poised to back the creation 
    of an enlarged Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) as the transitional government, 
    although there is no agreement on how its members would be chosen. Washington 
    hopes that Sistani, who has indicated he will abide by the recommendations 
    of U.N. experts as to how to proceed, will be willing to deal. In this context, 
    the administration appears increasingly frantic about involving the United 
    Nations, which plans to send a team to Iraq to assess the situation next week. 
    While it hopes the world body can devise an agreement that will keep all parties 
    calm and its transition timetable on track, Washington also clearly sees it 
    as a convenient scapegoat if things go bad.</b></p>
  <p><b>Not content with the mounting signs of civil war in Iraq, however, the 
    Pentagon, presumably with the help of Vice President Dick Cheney's office, 
    was reported this week by Jane's Intelligence Digest to be drawing up plans 
    for carrying out raids on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and Syria, in what 
    would be a notable expansion of Bush's &quot;war on terror.&quot; Some of 
    the same personnel who worked in the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans (OSP), 
    which reviewed intelligence for evidence allegedly linking Saddam to the al-Qaeda 
    terrorist group and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs before the 
    Iraq invasion, have reportedly been working on a similar effort regarding 
    Syria. David Warmer, a neo-conservative who has long advocated destabilizing 
    Damascus through Lebanon and Iraq, joined Cheney's staff as his Mideast adviser 
    last September.</b></p>
  <p><b>An administration ally, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, 
    also suggested this week that Iraq's alleged WMD stockpiles were transported 
    to Syria before the war. Most observers here believe the administration is 
    unlikely to authorize such operations before the November presidential elections, 
    if only because it would fuel voter concerns and Democratic charges that the 
    president's conduct of the &quot;war on terror&quot; has been reckless and 
    far too costly in blood, treasure and alliances.</b></p>
  <p><b>They suggest the reports are being deliberately circulated to intimidate 
    Syria's Assad regime into complying with a series of US demands, including 
    cutting off aid to Hezbollah and Palestinian groups. Jane's noted, however, 
    that US attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon could well destabilize that country 
    only a decade after its last civil war.<br>
