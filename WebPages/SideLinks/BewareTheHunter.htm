    a fortification, which was hardly a matter for wonder, since it was built 
    originally as a blockhouse when Indians were bad in Tennessee. It had since 
    acquired a sheathing of white painted clapboards to cover its log walls, and 
    a shake roof. But these improvements failed to add measurably to the symmetry 
    or congruity of the place.</p>
  <p>Yet it was a home, a well-loved home, where people lived, and went about 
    their daily tasks...And though there were in Tennessee many finer houses, 
    this home was the most notable in the state, because it was the dwelling of

  <p>On Dec.7, 1993, a deranged man named Colin Ferguson opened fire on a Long 
    Island Railroad train as it approached the Merillon Avenue Station, killing 
    six commuters and wounding 19 others in a random, bloody rampage. Among the 
    dead was Dennis McCarthy of Mineola and among those gravely wounded was his 
    son Kevin.</p>
  <p>Ferguson had traveled to California to purchase his weapons, and equipped 
    it with an assault-style magazine and Black Talon bullets, which explode on 
    impact and shred human tissue. Their manufacturer has since pulled them from 
    the market <i>(the whole head is sick)</i>...</p>
  <p>Carolyn McCarthy, widow of Dennis and mother of Kevin, channeled her grief 
    and her rage into political activism, becoming first, a gun control advocate, 
    and now a member of the U.S. Congress who is a leading proponent of gun control. 
  </p>
  <p>She is, according to politicians of both parties <i>(the whole head is sick)</i>, 
    so lacking in partisanship and so unwavering in her commitment to doing what

<p><font size="+1"> There is violence in America because violence is rooted in 
  the American state of mind. (Peace and righteousness strive to be, but violence 
  and injustice rule). As the Mind thinks, the Body acts. The body (in this case 
  the people) behaves as the Mind (in this case the leaders of the nation) thinks. 
  When there is violence and criminal behavior among those at the top <i>(spiritual 
  wickedness in high places)</i>, it will just as certainly manifest itself everywhere 
  below, among the people. It is natural karma--the Law of Nature itself. America 
  is founded in violence, in the insane use of guns and munitions (in outright 
  rebellion against the teachings of Christ). And it has sustained itself through 
  two centuries of crime and violence against both man and nature--pillage, rape, 
  genocide, slavery, oppression and injustice, not only against its own peoples--in 
  the name of Christ-- but against peoples everywhere throughout the earth <i>(the 
  whole head is sick)</i>. America is now reaping as a nation what it has sown 
  as a nation. It is the law of Nature, the law to which the natural mind is subject. 
  Only through grace and repentence are the laws suspended. (In a recent book 
  entitled <i>The Unfinished Presidency </i>the author says that Jimmy Carter 
  is the only one of the recent American presidents that </font><font size="+1"> 
  is not criminally insane. But even he, despite all his lofty religious rhetoric, 
  is an American first. And true to the American ideal he is also a warmaker of 
  the highest order. <i>The whole head is sick.</i></font></p>
<p align="center">THE WARRIOR CULTURE</p>
<p align="center">Barbara Ehrenreich</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>In what we like to think of as &quot;primitive&quot; warrior cultures, the 
    passage to manhood requires the blooding of a spear, the taking of a scalp 
    or head. Among the Massai of eastern Africa, the North American Plains Indians 
    and dozens of other pretechnological peoples, a man could not marry until 
    he had demonstrated his capacity to kill in battle. Leadership too in a warrior 
    culture is typically contingent on military prowess and wrapped in the mystique 
    of death...It was the duty of the Aztec kings to nourish the gods with the 
    heart of human captives.</p>
  <p>All warrior peoples have fought for the same high-sounding reasons: honor, 
    glory or revenge. The nature of their real and perhaps not conscious motivations 
    is the subject of much debate. Some anthropologists postulate a murderous 
    instinct, almost unique among living species, in human males. Others discern 
    a materialistic motive behind every fray: a need for slaves; grazing land 
    or even human flesh to eat. Still others point to the similarities between 
    war and other male pastimes--the hunt and outdoor sports--and suggests that 
    it is boredom, ultimately, that stirs men to fight.</p>
  <p>But in a warrior culture it hardly matters which motive is most basic. Aggressive 
    behavior is rewarded whether or not it is innate to the human psyche. Shortage 
    of resources are habitually taken as occasions for armed offensives, rather 
    than for hard thought and innovation. And war, to a warrior people, is of 
    course the highest adventure, the surest antidote to malaise, the endlessly 
    repeated theme of legend, song, religious myth and personal quest for meaning. 
    It is how men die and what they find to live for.</p>
  <p>&quot;You must understand that America is a warrior nation,&quot; Senator 
    Patrick Moynihan told a group of Arab leaders...one month into the Middle 
    East crisis. He said this proudly, and he may, without thinking through the 
    ugly implications, have told the truth. In many ways, in outlook and behavior, 
    the U.S. has begun to act like a primitive warrior culture.</p>
  <p>We seem to believe that leadership is expressed, in no small part, by a willingness 
    to cause the death of others. After the U.S. invasion of Panama, President 
    Bush exulted that no man could call him &quot;timid;&quot; he was at last 
    a &quot;macho man.&quot; The press, in even more primal language, hailed him 
    for succeeding in an &quot;initiation rite&quot; by demonstrating his &quot;willingness 
    to shed blood.&quot;</p>
  <p>For lesser offices too we apply the standards of a warrior culture. Female 
    candidates are routinely advised to overcome the handicap of their gender 
    by talking &quot;tough.&quot; Thus, for example, Dianne Feinstein has embraced 
    capital punishment, while Colorado senatorial candidate Josie Heath has found 
    it necessary to announce that though she is the mother of an 18-year-old son, 
    she is prepared to vote for war. Male candidates...are finding their military 
    records under scrutiny. No one expects them, as elected officials...to pick 
    up a spear or a sling and fight. But they must state, at least their willingness, 
    to have another human being killed.</p>
  <p>More tellingly, we are unnerved by peace, and seem to find it boring. When 
    the cold war ended we found no reason to celebrate. Instead we heated up the 
    &quot;war on drugs.&quot; What should have been a public-health campaign, 
    focused on the persistent shame of poverty, became a new occasion for martial 
    rhetoric and muscle flexing. Months later, when the Berlin Wall fell and communism 
    collapsed throughout Europe, we Americans did not dance in the streets. What 
    we did, according to the networks, was change the channel to avoid the news. 
    NONVIOLENT REVOLUTIONS DO NOT UPLIFT US, and the loss of mortal enemies only 
    seem to leave us empty and bereft. </p>
  <p>Our collective fantasies center on mayhem, cruelty and violent death. Loving 
    images of the human body--especially of bodies seeking pleasure or expressing 
    love--inspire us with the urge to censor. Our preference is for warrior themes: 
    the lone fighting man, bandoliers across his naked chest, MOWING DOWN LESSER 
    MEN IN BURSTS OF AUTOMATIC WEAPON FIRE. Only a real war seems to revive our 
    interest in real events. With the Iraqi crisis, the networks report that ratings 
    for news shows rose again--even higher than they were for Panama.</p>
  <p>As in any primitive warrior culture, our warrior elite takes pride of place. 
    Social crises multiply numbingly--homelessness, illiteracy, epidemic disease--and 
    our leaders tell us solemnly that nothing can be done. There is no money...Meanwhile, 
    nearly a third of the federal budget flows, even in moments of peace, to the 
    warriors and their weaponmakers. When those priorities are questioned, some 
    new &quot;crisis&quot; dutifully arises to serve as another occasion for armed 
    and often unilateral intervention. </p>
  <p>Now with Operation Desert Shield, our leaders are reduced to begging foreign 
    powers for the means to support our warrior class...It has not penetrate our 
    imagination that in a world where the powerful, industrialized nation-states 
    are at last at peace, there might be other ways to face down a pint-size Third 
    World warrior state than with massive force of arms. Nor have we begun to 
    see what an anachronism we are in danger of becoming: a warrior nation in 
    a world that pines for peace, a high-tech state with the values of a warrior 
    band...Intoxicated by their own drumbeats and war songs, fascinated by the 
    glint of steel and the prospect of blood, they will go forth, time and again, 
    to war.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Time</font>.</p>

    no coward. But he represented the Past. His influence was incompatible with 
    progress, and his death marks an era in the civilization of the Sioux. In 
    the language of General Miles, 'His tragic fate was but the ending of a tragic 
    life. Since the days of Pontiac, Tecumseh, and Red Jacket no Indian has had 
    the power of drawing to him so large a following of his race and molding and 
    wielding it against the authority of the United States, or of inspiring it 
    with greater animosity against the white race and civilization.&quot;</p>
  <p>On the morning of December 29, 1890, preparations were made to DISARM the 
    Indians preparatory to taking them to the agency and thence to the railroad...Shortly 
    after 8 oclock in the morning the warriors were ordered to come out of their 
    tipis and deliver their arms. They came forward and seated themselves on the 
    ground in front of the troops. They were then ordered to go by themselves 
    into their tipis and bring out and surrender their guns. The first twenty 
    went and returned...with only two guns. It seemed evident that they were unwilling 
    to give them up...The (subsequent) search (by the soldiers) had consumed considerable 
    time and created a good deal of excitement among the women and children , 
    as the soldiers found it necessary in the process to overturn the beds and 
    other furniture of the tipis and in some instances drove out the residents. 
    All of this had its effect on their husbands and brothers, already wrought 
    up to a high nervous tension and not knowing what might come next. While the 
    soldiers had been looking for the guns Yellow Bird, a medicine man, had been 
    walking about among the warriors, blowing on an eagle bone whistle, and urging 
    them to resistance, telling them that the soldiers would become weak and powerless, 
    and that the bullets would bounce off the sacred 'ghost shirts' which nearly 
    every one of the Indians wore...</p>
  <p>From the number of sticks set up by the Indians to mark where the dead fell, 
    as seen by the author a year later, this one volley must have killed nearly 
    half the warriors. The survivors sprung to their feet, throwing their blankets 
    from their shoulders as they rose...Although many of the warriors had no guns, 
    nearly all had revolvers and knives in their belts...The very lack of guns 
    made the fight more bloody, as it brought the combatants to close quarters.</p>
  <p>At the first volley the Hotchkiss guns trained on the camp opened fire and 
    sent a storm of shells and bullets among the women and children, who had gathered 
    in front of the tipis to watch the unusual spectacle of military display. 
    The guns poured in 2-pound explosive shells at the rate of nearly fifty per 
    minute, mowing down everything alive. The terrible effect may be judged by 
    the fact that one woman survivor, Blue Whirlwind...received fourteen wounds, 
    while each of her two little boys was also wounded by her side. In a few minutes 
    200 Indian men, women, and children, with 60 soldiers, were lying dead and 
    wounded on the ground, the tipis had been torn down by the shells and some 
    of them were burning above the helpless wounded, and the surviving handful 
    of Indians were flying in wild panic to the shelter of the ravine, pursued 
    by hundreds of maddened soldiers and followed by a raking fire from the Hotchkiss 
    guns, which had been moved into position to sweep the ravine.</p>
  <p>There can be no question that the pursuit was simply a massacre, where fleeing 
    women, with infants in their arms, were shot down after resistance had ceased 
    and when almost every warrior was stretched dead or dying on the ground. On 
    this point such a careful writer as Herbert Welsh says: 'From the fact that 
    so many women and children were killed, and that their bodies were found far 
    from the scene of action, and as though they were shot down while flying, 
    it would look as though blind rage had been at work.&quot;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">

<p align="center">By William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;Another year has passed on our American journey. THE SEASONS HAVE COMPLETED 
    ANOTHER CYCLE, AND IT IS HARVEST TIME IN AMERICA. Once again, millions of 
    us will gather with family and friends to give thanks to God for the many 
    blessings that He has bestowed upon us.</p>
  <p>This Thanksgiving Day, as every day, we are grateful for the gift of freedom, 
    for the vision made real by our Nation's founders and preserved by the courage, 
    vigilance, and sacrifice of generations of Americans. We are thankful for 
    the bounty and beauty of this great land, which has welcomed so many to its 
    shores across the years. We cherish the love of our families and friends. 
    We value the opportunity to provide for our children's future with the fruits 
    of our honest labor. And like the Pilgrims who celebrated Thanksgiving 300 
    years ago, we thank God for bringing us safely to the threshold of a new world, 
    full of exhilarating challenge and promise<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>In this new world, our children are growing up free from the shadows of the 
    Cold War and the threat of nuclear holocaust. Nations once held captive by 
    Communism are learning the lessons of liberty and democracy. A revolution 
    in technology has brought the world closer together and holds the prospect 
    of greater knowledge and prosperity for people across the globe.</p>
  <p>More than three centuries of change and growth separate us from the Pilgrims 
    and their Native American friends who sat down together for their Thanksgiving 
    meal <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(read the true history of these 
    events)</font>. But the example and experience of those early Americans still 
    hold great meaning for us today. They remind us that God's love strengthens 
    and sustains us, both as individuals AND AS A NATION. They remind us that 
    everyone has something to contribute, and that we are richer when we learn 
    to share. They teach us a simple but powerful lesson that each new generation 
    of Americans must learn and pass on: We need one another. Like the Pilgrims, 
    if we are to flourish in our new world, we must do so not as isolated individuals, 
    but as members of a family, one America, sharing our gifts and leaving no 
    one behind.&quot;</p>

<p align="center">SALVADOR ATROCITY UNDENIABLE NOW</p>
<p align="center">by Anthony Lewis</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Once in a rare while a writer examines a debated episode of recent history 
    with such thoroughness and integrity that the truth can no longer be in doubt. 
    Mark Danner did just that in a long article that took up last week's issue 
    of The New Yorker.</p>
  <p>Danner's subject was the massacre in December 1981 in the Salvadoran village 
    of El Mozote. Over the years politicians and journalists have differed bitterly 
    over what happened there--who did the killing, indeed whether there was a 
    massacre at all. The argument is now over.</p>
  <p>After the Danner report, no rational person can doubt that Salvadoran government 
    forces carried out a massacre. They killed hundreds of people in El Mozote 
    and other hamlets nearby: men, women, children, infants. They killed with 
    savagery that is hard even to read about.</p>
  <p>Chepe Mozote was 7 years old at the time, one of a group of children taken 
    by the soldiers to a playing field near the school. He told Danner: </p>
  <p>&quot;I didn't really understand what was happening until I saw a soldier 
    take a kid he had been carrying--maybe 3 years old--throw him in the air and 
    stab him with a bayonet. They slit some of the kid's throats, and many they 
    hanged from the tree...The soldiers kept telling us, 'You are guerrillas and 
    this is justice. This is justice.'&quot;...</p>
  <p>THE KILLERS WERE FROM THE U.S. TRAINED ATLACATL BATTALION. (At the School 
    of the Americas in Georgia). Their commanders, making a drive through territory 
    where rebel forces had been, decided to kill everyone on the theory that the 
    local population had nurtured the rebels. In fact, El Mozote was a stronghold 
    of evangelical Christians, who were FIERCELY anti-communist...</p>
  <p>Reagan administration officials denounced the massacre reports as false. 
    The Wall Street Journal attacked the reporters as &quot;credulous&quot; victims 
    of communist propaganda...</p>
  <p>Drawing on newly released documents and his own follow-up interviews, Danner 
    traces how the U.S. government's misleading denials of the massacre were created.</p>
  <p>After the newspaper stories, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador sent two men 
    to investigate the alleged massacre...They got within a few miles of El Mozote, 
    but the Salvadoran government forces taking them would go no further.</p>
  <p>Both men were convinced, from talks with refugees nearby, that something 
    terrible had happened...But they had no firsthand evidence, and that was what 
    the embassy cable to Washington said: &quot;No evidence could be found to 
    confirm that government forces systematically massacred civilians.&quot; The 
    Reagan administration used that line to deny the massacre stories. Its interest 
    was not in truth but in getting congress to continue military aid to El Salvador 
    <i>(the whole head is sick)...</i></p>
  <p>Some of the Americans who have denied the massacre have come to regret their 
    actions and said so. Other politicians and editors have been unrepentant. 
    I hope they will read Danner's report. THEY MIGHT TRY TO READ ALOUD, TO THEIR 
    FAMILIES, THE PASSAGES ABOUT THE KILLING OF THE CHILDREN OF EL MOZOTE.</p>

<p align="center">VIOLENT CULTURE</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>It was an almost unimaginable crime, allegedly committed by unimaginably 
    young boys: Arkansas middle-school students were flushed from their school 
    by a false fire alarm, and then mercilessly picked off, one by one, by a 13 
    year-old and his 11 year-old cousin, dressed in camouflage fatigues and crouching 
    in the woods. Now four of their classmates, all girls, are dead, along with 
    a vibrant and beloved TEACHER who used her body to keep the bullets from hitting 
    yet another child.</p>
  <p>&quot;THERE'S NO EXPLANATION IN MY OPINION WHY AN 11 YEAR-OLD OR A 13 YEAR-OLD 
    WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS,&quot; was the reaction of the local sherrif...It's 
    an understandable reaction at first, perhaps, but to accept that there is 
    &quot;no explanation&quot; is to despair at ever finding an answer, much less 
    ever doing something about the rising tide of violence in this country...</p>
  <p>WE SIMPLY MUST START HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE CREATED HERE, 
    A CULTURE SATURATED WITH CONFLICT, WORSHIPFUL OF WEAPONRY OF ALL KINDS, where 
    little things become big issues to be settled in big ways. THOSE BOYS DIDN'T 
    DRESS UP IN CAMOUFLAGE AND ARM THEMSELVES TO THE TEETH BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT

<p align="center"><font size="+2">WHEN CHILDREN KILL</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Last weekend another child shot up another group of teachers and schoolmates, 
    this time at a middle-school dance in Edinboro, Pa. Suddenly a troubling coincidence 
    looks like a terrifying pattern. Three other times this school year, students 
    have ambushed and murdered peers and teachers; five dead in Arkansas last 
    month, three in Kentucky in December, two in Mississippi in October.</p>
  <p>Plainly, the nation is missing some important thing. We know that access 
    to firearms is a component of these calamities. CHILDREN EQUIPPED WITH IMMATURE 
    EMOTIONS AND ADULT WEAPONS are a common denominator in each case. We also 
    know that the killers give off signals--threats to kill; warning to friends 
    to stay away; ASSERTIONS THAT PERCEIVED INJUSTICES SOON WOULD BE VIOLENTLY 
    RESOLVED.</p>
  <p>But guns are everywhere in rural and suburban America, and they always have 
    been. And immature youngsters are bound to bark and bluff. The same utterances 
    a decade ago--&quot;I wish you were dead&quot;; &quot;I'm going to kill you,&quot;--reliably 
    meant nothing.</p>
  <p>SO WHAT'S CHANGED? Maybe there's an unknown Darkness in some children, A 
    RECESSED PSYCHOSIS triggered by an intense and sometimes lurid coverage of 
    such events. (What events?) It's easy to accuse the psycho-posing Marilyn 
    Mansons and leering Jerry Springers of misdirecting young minds incapable 
    of compromise.</p>
  <p>SURE, GUNS PLAY A ROLE <i>(the whole head is sick).</i> We need child-access 
    laws <i>(the whole head is sick)</i>, and we need them enforced <i>(the whole 
    head is sick)</i>. And children must be taught to take every threat seriously. 
    But in the pooling light of another bloody ambush <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(this 
    article was written before Columbine)</font>, such pragmatism feels inadequate. 
    When children take the lives of others to validate their own, you know that 
    some awful threshold was crossed long before any trigger was pulled. So we 
    have to wonder; what did we fail to teach those children? AND WHAT DID THEY 
    FAIL TO LEARN?</p>

  <p>MOSES LAKE,Wash...Well before the school shootings in Oregon and the South 
    prompted A SEARCH TO THE DEPTHS OF THE NATIONAL SOUL, a 14 year-old honor 
    student...walked into his algebra class in this hard little farm town and 
    shot his teacher in the back and two students in the chest.</p>
  <p>Guns and violent videos were always around the boy's house. HE LEARNED HOW 
    TO FIRE WEAPONS FROM HIS FATHER. And he picked up a pose from the Oliver Stone 
    movie &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; telling a friend it would be &quot;pretty 
    cool&quot; to go on a killing spree just like the two lead characters in the

    a dying boy who was choking on his own blood...</p>
  <p>A sign soon appeared on a nearby school, bearing a single word: WHY? Of late, 
    that question has been asked around the nation, following a spate of multiple-victim 
    school shootings over the last nine months...People wonder whether something 
    aberrant and terrifying--like a lethal virus, some have called it--is in the 
    bloodstream...</p>
  <p>From this case and interviews with police officers, prosecutors, psychologists 
    and parents of the attackers--as well as the boys own words--several patterns 
    emerge...</p>
  <p>The killers were able to easily acquire high-powered guns, and in many cases 
    their parents helped the children get them, either directly or through negligence. 
    Guns with rapid-fire capability, usually semi-automatic rifles that can spray 
    a burst of bullets in a matter of seconds, were used in the incidents with 
    the most victims...</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>WASHINGTON, May 27_ The Central Intelligence Agency, plotting to overthrow 
    the Guatemalan Government in the early 1950s, drew up a &quot;disposal list&quot; 
    of at least 58 key leaders, and it trained assassins to kill them, newly declassified 
    documents show.</p>
  <p>The coup, code-named Operation Success, toppled the freely elected President 
    of Guatemala, Jacobo Arbenz Guzman, and installed the first of a series of 
    right-wing leaders friendly to the United States.</p>
  <p>The assassination plans were never carried out, according to an official 
    C.I.A. history of the coup. &quot;Until the day that Arbenz resigned in June 
    1954 the option of assassination was still being considered,&quot; the history 
    concludes...</p>
  <p>The 1954 coup was the first chapter in the C.I.A.'s long and continuing liaison 
    with the Guatemalan military. Those ties deepened over the decades during 
    a scorched-earth campaign against a small Communist insurgency. The civil 
    war in Guatemala touched off in part by the coup, ended only five months ago. 
    More than 100,000 civilians were killed.</p>

    trained at the school were far too often involved in atrocities. He is now

<blockquote> 
  <p>To build support for his Kosovo policy, President Bill Clinton has played 
    seemingly every historical-rhetorical card: World War I, World War II, the 
    Cold War, Vietnam--even the struggle against hate crimes and discrimination 
    against gays and lesbians. But Clinton's orgy of analogy only proves, as Alexander 
    Pope wrote nearly three centuries ago, &quot;a little learning is a dangerous 
    thing&quot;--and so drink deep, the poet advised, or drink not at all from 
    the spring of wisdom.</p>
  <p>Clinton's arguments show that he has learned the contradictory lessons of 
    the last century of statecraft and that he agrees with all of them. The most 
    poignant of these historical references is World War I, which was triggered 
    by an assassination in the Balkan city of Sarajevo, just 100 miles from Kosovo.</p>
  <p>ONE BY ONE IN THE SUMMER OF 1914, THE GREAT POWERS OF EUROPE WERE PPULLED 
    BY THEIR ALLIANCES INTO THECAULDRON OF CONFLICT...</p>
  <p>Serbia is no strategic threat to America. But that doesn't mean that Milosovic 
    is completely without retaliatory capacity; it was Serb terror that precipitated 
    World War I and, since enemies tend to have long memories, an act of vengeance 
    <i>(For vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord...</i>Deut.32:35-42; Heb.10:30,31) 
    could come in a year, a decade, or a century.</p>
  <p>Americans have gotten used to push-button conflicts in which we suffer virtually 
    no casualties. But our power, however well-intentioned and well-aimed, feels 
    far different to those who have been on the receiving end of a cruise missile 
    or who think they may be next. IF CLINTON UNDERSTOOD HISTORY AS WELL AS HE 
    CLAIMS TO, HE WOULD BE MORE COGNIZANT OF THE COST TO A PROUD POWER WHEN THE

    middle-school students.</p>
  <p>What happened in Jonesboro would be horrific enough if it were a freak event.

    have done it as much as angry at the world in which such a thing can happen....What 
    kind of world is that?&quot; (he says).</p>
  <p>It's a world where children are raised in a gun-crazy society. We firmly

<blockquote> 
  <p>Dinner was almost ready when the killing occurred. The father wandered into 
    the living room of his home in Leawood, Kan., one evening last September. 
    His ten-year-old son, and a 12-year-old friend were sitting in front of a 
    large-screen television set. They were playing a video game they had rented 
    called Goldeneye 007, one of the top-selling titles of 1998. (Don't forget 
    Mortal Combat). </p>
  <p>Standing behind the boys, he saw the video, rated T (Teen) for ages 13 and 
    older, depicted the shooter's point of view, with his large gun jutting into 
    the bottom of the TV frame. After a few minutes the friend cornered an unarmed 
    opponent and held the gun to his head at point-blank range. &quot;You can't 
    get away!&quot; the boy said with a maniacal (demonic) sneer, taunting the 
    character on the screen, &quot;You're mine!&quot;</p>
  <p>The boy pushed the button and shot the character in the face. Blood splattered 
    on the lab coat of the character as he whirled and fell...</p>
  <p>Chilled by the child's obvious glee, the father ordered the boys to turn 
    the game off. &quot;This game is disgusting,&quot;`he said sternly...&quot;I'm 
    not going to invite somebody into my house to teach kids to kill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">MURDER AND MAYHEM</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Video games have become a pervasive form of entertainment in the 1990s. Today 
    an estimated 69 percent of American families own or rent video and computer 
    games. Most are harmless entertainment (?), but in far too many of the most 
    popular ones, kids are acting out realistical violent experiences on their 
    TV and computer screens. They hare severing heads and snapping spines in Mortal 
    Kombat IV. They are paying a go-go dancer to flash her breasts and then blowing 
    her away in Duke Nukem 3D. They are scorching the high school band with a 
    flamethrower until they burn to death in Postal.</p>
  <p>&quot;These are not games any more,&quot; says Rick Dyer, president of the 
    San Diego based Virtual Image Productions and an outspoken critic of titles 
    with violent and sexual content. &quot;THESE ARE LEARNING MACHINES. We are 
    teaching kids in the most incredible manner what it's like to pull the trigger. 
    The focus is on the thrill, enjoyment and reward. What they are not learning 
    is the real-life consequences...</p>
  <p>Makers of the more violent games are pushing the outer limits of savagery 
    and depravity. One of the most hotly anticipated videos is the sequel to CARMAGEDDON...In 
    CARPOCALYPSE NOW, your victims not only squish under your tires and splatter 
    blood on the windshield, they also get on their knees and beg for mercy, or 
    commit suicide. If you like, you can dismember them...</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">POTENTIAL FOR HARM</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>When it comes to the effects of video games on children, there's a double 
    standard in the industry: While publishers trumpet educational games in helping 
    develop kid's learning skills, they discount that violent games can have baser 
    influences on behavior and attitude. &quot;There has been no evidence to show 
    that video games increase violence in children,&quot; says Pat Becker of Electronic 
    Arts, the industry's largest publisher. (And this, because this industry as 
    well as the American people at large believe that the level of violence that 
    already exists, and particularly state-sponsored violence in almost all of 
    its forms, is normal social behavior, and therefore pretends to see no abnormal, 
    or appreciable rise in what to them is actually standard behavior)...</p>
  <p>&quot;With video games kids don't just observe an aggressor rewarded; they 
    experience the direct reward,&quot; says Stanford communications professor 
    Donald Roberts. &quot;Engaging in these activities rather than watching them 
    increases the potential for the negative effects to take hold.&quot;</p>

    a child plays a point-and-shoot video game, he is learning the exact same 
    conditioned reflex skills as a soldier or police officer in training.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The media are probably more powerful than we realize,&quot; says...David 
    Walsh. &quot;And if parents are (spiritually) responsible for caring for their 
    children, then our definition of &quot;caring&quot; has to keep pace with

<p align="center">FIRST IT'S ABOUT KILLING</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>The military exists to kill people in large numbers. Its press agents prefer 
    to say, &quot;No, it exists to prevent such mass killings.&quot; It does so, 
    they say, by being ready and willing to kill in large numbers.</p>
  <p>And so, this being the land of the free, and the home of the press agent, 
    instead of naming it the War Department, we prettify reality by calling it 
    the Defense Department, while referring to death as &quot;body count.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mushmouth talk of this sort produces slogans like &quot;Peace is Our Business&quot; 
    for B-52 crews whose actual business is to kill multitudes by dropping nuclear 
    bombs at official command.</p>
  <p>Historically, our military killing work has been inflicted exclusively on 
    men. Men who hated it were forced to do it anyhow.</p>
  <p>Such men must always constitute a great majority, since (1) most men instinctively 
    shrink from killing people, and (2) most men fear the prospect of being killed 
    or maimed, which are high probability risks of the job. Commanders sensibly 
    pack their armies with males young enough to think themselves immortal.</p>
  <p>Until recently few women have shown much zest for this ghastly toil. Now, 
    however, they clamor for official license to kill and be killed, just like 
    all those wretched men...</p>

  <p>Many factors may contribute to the new attitude toward the military. For

  <p>The play opened with a slideshow of the 1960s, with images of John Kennedy, 
    Martin Luther King Jr. and pro-war protests. The sounds of the times, including 
    Simon and Garfunkel's &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; and &quot;Bridge Over 
    Troubled Waters,&quot; played while the images flashed before the audience.</p>
  <p>Allison Krause, Jeff Miller, Bill Schroeder and Sandra Scheuer came on stage, 
    talking about the problems of the period, as if spirits visiting present day. 
  </p>
  <p>The play told of the events of the weekend and the actual shooting on May 
    4. Many hints also were given about the conspiracy of the Ohio and federal 
    governments against the protesters. The dance and oral performance described 
    the emotions and reactions of the mothers of the slain students. The words 
    spoken were from actual documents written by the mothers.</p>

<p align="center">Kent State Staff Reporters</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Once again, the eyes of the nation are on Kent State University as it observed 
    another milestone anniversary of the events that earned it a lasting place 
    in American history.</p>
  <p>Thirty years have passed since the volley of gunfire (from the rifles of 
    the Army National Guard) that claimed the lives of Allison Krause, Jeffrey 
    Miller, William Schroeder and Sandra Scheuer and wounded nine other KSU students 
    on a sunny afternoon on May 4, 1970. And, more than a generation later, questions 
    remain about what happened at Kent State.</p>
  <p>In the 30 years since that day, the shootings have been acknowledged as a 
    turning point in the protests over the Vietnam War that ripped this nation 
    apart. What happened at Kent State &quot;brought the war home&quot; to many 
    Americans and drove home the need to bring that long and bloody misadventure 
    to a close...</p>
  <p>What happened on May 4, 1970 was a tragedy, the result of a series of events 
    which spiraled out of control to a bloody conclusion. The historic distinction 
    that Kent State bears as a result is not a welcome one, but it is one the 
    university as an institution, and its students, as individuals, have had to 
    grapple with for three decades...</p>
  <p>Like the people of Oklahoma City and Littleton, Colorado, the Kent community 
    appears fated to relive a terrible moment of its history on a regular basis 
    in the national spotlight. The media spotlight will end today, at least for 
    a while, but nothing can erase May 4. 1970 from Kent's history.</p>

<p><font size="+1">For many the highlight of these observances was the Dance Performance 
  on the 3rd of May, when several members of the student dance troupe appeared 
  among those of us milling and conversing about the campus grounds, in a choreographed 
  display of military close-order and rifle fire drill. The performers then led 
  the observers to the parking lot where the four students were slain that fateful 
  day, and where the entire dance team was waiting. The next stage of the performance 
  was a heart-stirring reenactment of the chaos, the panic, the defiance of that 
  day, and the ensuing grief everyone felt as the dancers spiraled around the 
  places where each of the students fell. Then the crowd of observers were led 
  by the dancers hand-in-hand across Blanket Hill where the demonstrations began 
  on the 4th, and down onto the commons where the soldiers of the national guard 
  were assembled that morning. The performance continued and ended there. Tears 
  of deep emotion and stunned silence were evident everywhere as the dance came 
  to its conclusion about a half hour later. Four students were left lifeless 
  on the field, as the rest of the performers walked away, in every direction, 
  off the field, and back onto the campus, back, they would have us all understand, 
  to their own private lives and personal careers--back into the same system that 
  had just slaughtered their own fellow students. Each, of course, was left free 
  to interpret it all for themselves. To many of us it was clear. The dancers 
  were portraying the spirit of forgetfulness that has gripped America since those 
  days.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>Thursday, May 4th, marks the 49th annual National Day of Prayer. The theme

    faithful in prayer.&quot; </p>
  <p>As America embraces the new century, prayer is our greatest hope--not just 
    one special day a year, but every day of our lives. God is moving in a powerful 
    way and you can play a significant role through your participation in praying 
    for OUR nation and its leaders.</p>
  <p>Your prayers have the power to transform your neighborhood, city, state, 
    and yes, YOUR country. How can you begin to do this? Exercise your CONSTITUTIONAL 
    right to pray publicly. From its inception, this nation was founded on the 
    timeless principle of freedom. It's a precious privilege and a gift, but if 
    we do not exercise our rights we may lose them... <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tri-State

  <p align="center">MOTHER'S DAY RALLIES FOR GUN CONTROL WILL MOBILIZE A NATIONAL 
    ACTIVIST NETWORK, ORGANIZERS HOPE</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">By Wendy Koch</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Mary Leigh Blek had never been active in politics. She was a stay-at-home 
    mom who organized PTA events and lived in a gated community in Orange County, 
    California. But that was before--before June June 29, 1994, the day her 21-year-old 
    son Matthew was murdered with a cheap handgun in New York City, the day, she 
    says, &quot;pure joy&quot; was taken from her life.</p>
  <p>&quot;I realized I was not immune to gun violence,&quot; says Blek, a Republican 
    who is the volunteer president of the board of directors for the Bell Campaign, 
    a national gun-control group. She'll take her message to Washington on Mother's 
    Day, May 14, when she'll join other parents for what is being billed as the 
    Million Mom March...</p>
  <p>The rallies might not succeed in prodding Congress to pass new gun laws this 
    year, and critics are skeptical of a lasting impact. &quot;Marches in Washington 
    are many,&quot; says the National Rifle Association's chief lobbyist, James 
    Jay Baker, who doubts it will change the dynamics on Capitol Hill...</p>

<p align="center"><a href="TheHolyChild.htm"><b>MYSTICAL POWER OF MOM</b></a></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;If this Congress doesn't act, we'll elect a new one,&quot; says Donna 
    Dees-Thomases, a New Jersey mother and part-time publicist who founded the 
    march. Dees-Thomases got the idea for the march in August after watching TV 
    news coverage of a shooting at a Los Angeles day camp that looked like one 
    her two daughters attend. The image haunted her: &quot;I couldn't stop thinking 
    about those kids.&quot; She applied for a march permit, hoping to harness 
    what she called the &quot;mystical power of mom.&quot;...</p>
  <p>&quot;My feeling is these big demonstrations are kind of tiresome,&quot; 
    says Phyllis Schlafly, a social conservative known for battling the Equal 
    Rights Amendment during the 1970s. &quot;You get the impression they are there 
    for the media. They show up, the cameras are there, and then they're gone.&quot;...</p>
  <p>Regardless, scholars say the results of any mass demonstrations might not 
    be known until years later. Even then, they say, it is difficult to point 
    to the protest as the reason for change, legislative or otherwise.</p>
  <p>The Vietnam Moratorium Rally of Nov. 15, 1969, for instance--with a crowd 
    of 600,000, perhaps the largest protest in the capital's history--might never 
    have grown so large had it not been for a far more more modest demonstration 
    four years before...</p>
  <p>And although Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech might 
    have made the civil-rights march of 1963 the most memorable in the capital's 
    history...the more modest marches in the South, particularly in Selma, did 
    more to prompt passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act...</p>
  <p>&quot;We're going to keep the momentum up,&quot; promises Steve Young, one 
    of the march organizers. We are encouraging all the million moms to keep active 
    back in their hometowns and states.&quot; Young is certain the impact of the 
    march will extend beyond Sunday. How can he be sure? &quot;I went to D.C. 
    in the spring of 71 to protest the war in Vietnam,&quot; he recounts...&quot;That 
    march was basically the turning point,&quot; he says. &quot;That's the kind 
    of energy the Million Mom March has.&quot; (SHOW THEM THE KING THAT THEY HAVE 
    CHOSEN).</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>The stage is set for a controversial re-enactment of the deadly 1993 siege 
    of Waco at the Branch Davidian compound--complete with tanks, submachine gun 
    fire and exploding grenades.</p>
  <p>The federal judge presiding over a wrongful-death suit filed by relatives 
    of cult members killed at the end of a 51-day standoff with federal agents 
    has ordered the re-enactment at Fort Hood, Texas.</p>
  <p>Seventy-four followers of David Koresh died in a raging blaze at the complex. 
    (Including wives and children).</p>
  <p>The lawsuit charges that the government caused the fire by blasting the building 
    with incendiary tear gas for nearly six hours, then shooting and ramming it 
    with tanks.</p>
  <p>The suit also charges that the government used excessive force, prevented 
    cult members from escaping the burning compound by shooting at it and was 
    negligent for not having plans to fight the blaze.</p>
  <p>According to a plan approved by the U.S. Attorney General, the gassing was 
    supposed to continue for 48 hours, with the tanks then moving in if no one 
    surrendered.</p>
  <p>In the re-enactment, men in camouflage and painted faces will run alongside 
    of the tanks; eight gunmen will fire submachine guns and pistols, and grenades 
    will explode in a field filled with shattered glass... according to court 
    documents.</p>
  <p>The FBI has insisted it did not shoot at the compound--that heat flashes 
    seen on infrared footage of the event were caused by sunlight hitting debris, 
    not gunfire--and that the re-enactment will prove it.</p>
  <p>But the plaintiffs argue the FBI is trying to stack the deck. The agency 
    is now asking to be allowed an 8-by-10-foot tent covered with a reflective 
    &quot;space blanket&quot; to guarantee flashes from sources other than gunfire.</p>
  <p>&quot;It is clear that the government and their experts are so desperate 
    to create a flash during the demonstrations from something other than gunfire, 
    that they are willing to sacrifice credibility and scientific accuracy in 
    the process,&quot; said Houston lawyer Michael Caddell, who represents some 
    of the victims.</p>
  <p>&quot;It is clear to everyone that there was nothing like a 6-foot-high tent 
    covered with space blankets at the site on April 19, 1993,&quot; Cadell said.</p>
  <p>The FBI declined to comment on any aspects of the case. </p>
  <p>Another sore point is that the re-enactment will be supervised and filmed 
    by Vector Data Systems, a British subsidiary of a U.S. firm that has approximately 
    $300 million in federal contracts...</p>
  <p>The new footage will be compared with the FBI's film, (the film that incriminates 
    the FBI). </p>
  <p>&quot;If there are flashes on the tape from gunfire, then we've got a huge 
    problem,&quot; Caddell said. &quot;Then we have seven years of FBI agents 
    lying about whether they fired on April 19.&quot; </p>
  <p>The trial is set for May.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Needless to say, the initial test 
    concluded there was no government rifle fire at the WACO compound that day. 
    The problem here is that even if the government is telling the truth in this 
    case, we do not believe it. We do not believe it because we know that it is 
    both capable and willing in all other cases to lie. The government is the 
    author of incessant lies and constant cover ups...John 8:43.44).</font></p>

  <p>DENVER, Aug.14 _ Moments before a Federal judge imposed the DEATH SENTENCE 
    that a jury had decreed for the Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy J. McVeigh 
    today broke the silence he had maintained throughout his trial.</p>
  <p>But his remarks were exceptionally brief--only four sentences--and their 
    meaning was obscure to many in the courtroom.</p>
  <p>Mr. McVeigh, wearing prison khakis and a military haircut, clasped his hands 
    behind him and, standing at a lectern, said in the controlled voice of a student 
    giving a recitation:</p>
  <p>&quot;I wish to use the words of Justice Brandeis dissenting in Olmstead 
    to speak for me. He wrote: 'Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent 
    teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.' 
    That's all I have.&quot;...</p>
  <p>In the larger passage from which the quotation was taken, Justice Brandeis 
    warned that the Government may not commit crimes to enforce the law and may 
    expect &quot;terrible retribution&quot; if it does.</p>
