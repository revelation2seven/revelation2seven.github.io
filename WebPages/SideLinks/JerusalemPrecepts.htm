<div align="center"><b>THE MESSAGES OF JERUSALEM</b></div>
<p align="center"><b>based on a sicha by </b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Harav Aharon Lichtenstein</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Gemara (Bava Kama 82b) lists ten rituals which were not performed in Jerusalem, 
  including the &quot;egla arufa&quot; (decapitated heifer), <b>declaration of 
  an &quot;ir ha-nidachat&quot; (idolatrous city)</b>, etc. The reason for this 
  unique status was that <b>Jerusalem, unlike all other portions of Eretz Yisrael, 
  was not given to any of the tribes</b>. </p>
<p>The most obvious reason for this state of affairs was in order to avoid jealousy 
  among the tribes - to prevent them from arguing over the privilege of having 
  Jerusalem in their portion (like the stones which, according to the Midrash, 
  fought for the honor of having Yaakov lay his head upon them to rest). However, 
  it would seem that if this had been the only problem, then a different solution 
  could have been found - for instance, by giving each tribe a small portion of 
  Jerusalem. <b>Hence, it appears that a deeper reason is involved, rather than 
  the merely pragmatic wish to avoid conflict.</b></p>
<p><b>We may say that the law defining Jerusalem's special status is comprised 
  of three separate components:</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p>1. The Gemara (Yoma 12a) teaches that houses may not be rented out in Jerusalem 
  because &quot;it (Jerusalem) is not theirs.&quot; In other words, the halakha 
  that Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes means, in practical terms, that 
  <b>Jerusalem does not belong to us. Jerusalem is not the private property or 
  personal acquisition of any person in Israel</b>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac4.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Exodus 23:20-23; 24:9,10...(KJV).</b></p>
<p>2. By virtue of the fact that Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes, it 
  is the city of Klal Yisrael - it is given to all the tribes collectively. When 
  the Torah describes the tribes - in the blessings bestowed by both Yaakov and 
  Moshe - it emphasizes the special character of each tribe. <b>The idea of the 
  uniqueness of each tribe also finds expression in the stones of the breastplate, 
  with each of the twelve different stones representing a separate tribe</b>. 
  The fact that Jerusalem was not given to any one specific tribe <b>lends it 
  a dimension of completeness and unity</b>. The unity of Jerusalem is a result 
  not of a negation and nullification of differences <b>but rather of a complex 
  combination of the different tribes</b>. In the closing verses of Sefer Yechezkel 
  the gates surrounding Jerusalem are named - one for each tribe.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">12 Tribes X 12 Signs X 1,000 (the number 10 X 10 X10 -- the 
    Cube of the mystery of the Tree of Life) = 144,000...(Revelation, chapter 
    7; Revelation 21:10-27...KJV).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>All of the tribes together contribute to the make-up of the city and together 
  create her completion</b>. Sefer Yechezkel concludes with the words, <b>&quot;And 
  the name of the city from that day [shall be], 'God is there.'&quot;</b> Rashi 
  explains <b>that this refers to the ancient name dating from the days of Malkhitzedek: 
  Shalem</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Hebrews 5:10-14; 7:1-28)</font>. 
  <b>This name expresses the wholeness and perfection of the city</b> which stems 
  from its not having been divided among the tribes.</p>
<p>3. Yoma (ibid.) also teaches that Jerusalem can never have the status of an 
  &quot;ir nidachat&quot; because the Torah, in teaching this law, uses the word 
  &quot;arekha&quot; (your cities) - and Jerusalem is not included in this collective 
  term since it was not given to any of the tribes. Although Jerusalem belongs 
  to Klal Yisrael, it is nevertheless not altogether and completely theirs: it 
  has a special status and is not part of &quot;arekha&quot; - the collection 
  of cities. <b>Jerusalem is God's city, the dwelling place of the Shekhina: &quot;This 
  is My resting place for ever and ever.&quot;</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">But unto to the place which the Lord your God shall choose 
    out of all your tribes to put His Name there, even unto His habitation shall 
    ye seek, and thither thou shalt come...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 
    12:5).</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>Read <i>The Mystical Shape of the Godhead</i>, by Gershom 
  Scholem. </b></p>
<p>We are used to the everyday reality of Jerusalem as a national capital, a cultural 
  center, a city reflecting the political reality - in short, a city which belongs 
  to us. Nevertheless, we need to examine closely the halakha which teaches that 
  Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes, <b>and no matter how much it may 
  seem to be in our possession, we need to perceive it as God's city</b>.</p>
<p>The three characteristics described above convey a three-fold message:</p>
<p>a. <b>The fact that Jerusalem belongs to no individual issues to us a call 
  to elevate ourselves above the egoism symbolized by private acquisitiveness</b>. 
  We need to rise above the prevailing idea that &quot;What is mine, is mine; 
  and what is yours, is yours&quot; - which, as we remember, is termed in Avot 
  as &quot;the philosophy of Sodom.&quot; <b>Thus, one aspect of Jerusalem is 
  elevation above considerations of promoting our own personal interests - both 
  material and spiritual</b>.</p>
<p>b. We need to rise above tribal differences, sectarianism. Lest any particular 
  group wish to claim exclusive rights to Jerusalem, we need to declare in response: 
  Jerusalem was not given to any of the tribes. <b>We need to rise above spiritual 
  imperialism which comes to impose one model only. Each stone of the breastplate 
  emphasizes a different aspect, a different tribe, and only a breastplate with 
  all twelve stones in place is fit for use. All twelve gates surrounding the 
  city collectively provide a fortified wall - a complete city!</b></p>
<p>c.<b> It is true that the royalty - the government - is located in Jerusalem; 
  Jerusalem is the heart of the nation</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Psalm 
  48)</font>. But at the same time, Jerusalem was not given over completely to 
  mortal rule. We live in the earthly Jerusalem (Yerushalayim shel mata), <b>but 
  we need to remember that this physical city faces the parallel heavenly Jerusalem 
  (Yerushalayim shel ma'ala). We need to rise above the human and national plane 
  and reach for the plane of Divine service; we must attempt to recognize the 
  Divine Presence in the city.</b></p>
<p><b>To our sorrow, today we are far from receiving the messages which Jerusalem 
  transmits. It is true that even the most distant Jew feels something in his 
  heart at the mere mention of the name &quot;Jerusalem,&quot; but this is not 
  sufficient. The feeling of unity and completeness, of elevation above egoism 
  driven by a value system based on kindness and uprightness, is lacking in the 
  public consciousness. In such a reality, we - the occupants of the Beit Midrash, 
  who are capable of absorbing these messages and realizing them - are obligated 
  to rise above egoism, sectarianism and divisiveness, and to attain a level of 
  sanctity, thereby spreading the message of Jerusalem further afield.</b></p>
<p><b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, will return in mercy to Jerusalem when we return 
  to Jerusalem in our hearts and souls.</b></p>

  <p><font size="+1">(Just as the Mysteries of Jerusalem were hidden from the 
    eyes of Judaism, so are the meanings of God's Oneness hidden from the eyes 
    of Islam...Islam knows that God is One--for this is God's revelation to Islam.

    that the most orthodox of Islamic believers are not yet fully aware of the 
    multiple ways in which this Oneness is manifested everywhere else in the world).</font></p>

<p><b>His Oneness</b></p>
<p><b>He is one in being without partner, unique without peer, ultimate without 
  opposite, alone without equal. He is one, preeternal, beginninglessly uncreate, 
  everlastingly abiding, unceasingly existent, eternally limitless, the ever self-subsisting 
  through whom all else subsists, ever enduring, without end. He is, was, and 
  ever will be possessed of all attributes of majesty, unannihilated by dissolution 
  or separation through the passage of eons or terminus of interims. He is the 
  First and Last, the Outward and Inward, and He has knowledge of everything...</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">The Creator (Ain Sof) is ONE-ABOVE. <i>His</i> mirror image 
    in the phenomenal world (E =mc2) is another. Together They are ONE. They have 
    brought forth in the earth generations of sons and daughters. All together 
    they are ONE. (Brahman is Atman. <i>I and my Father are One)</i>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>His </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Their)</font><b> Transcendence</b></p>
<p><b>He is not a body with a form, or a luminary, quantitative substance, not 
  resembling bodies in quantifiability or divisibility, or in being a substance 
  or qualified by substance, or being an accident or qualified by accidents. He 
  does not resemble anything that exists, nor anything that exists resemble Him</b>. 
  <b>There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him, nor is He like unto anything. 
  He is not delimited by magnitude, contained by places, encompassed by directions, 
  or bounded by heavens or earth</b>. He is 'ascendant over the Throne' (mustawin, 
  Koran 20:5) in the way He says and the meaning He intends, 'ascendant' in a 
  manner transcending contact, settledness, position, indwelling, or movement. 
  The Throne does not bear Him up, but is borne up by the subtlety of His infinite 
  power, <b>as are the angels who carry it</b>, and all are powerless in His grasp. 
  <b>He is above the Throne, the heavens, and all else to the farthest reaches 
  of the stars, with an aboveness that does not increase His nearness to the Throne 
  or the heavens</b>, or His distance from the earth and what lies beneath it. 
  <b>He is as exalted in degree above the Throne and the heavens as He is above 
  the earth and its depths, though He is near to everything in existence, nearer 
  to a servant than his own jugular vein, and is witness to everything</b>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">The Infinite Creator, the Indescribable Mind beyond the Mind 
    of the Universe itself (beyond the lower world of the Ten Sefirot) is all 
    that Imam al-Ghazali says He is. But Imam al-Ghazali cannot describe Him. 
    He defies and transcends such descriptions. Pinpoint God and God will appear 
    in another place. As Light appears as both waves and particles, so God dwells 
    in the realm of <i>Paradox</i>. He is here and there. He is nowhere and everywhere. 
    Nor is He a <i>He</i>. He is beyond gender (but perhaps He is a <i>He; </i>we 
    will never know). Nevertheless, inside of this universe (on this side of Genesis 
    1:1), They have form and quantitative substance. Inside of this universe everything 
    is a part of Them (They are ONE). Inside of this universe They are like everything, 
    and everything is likened to Them. They are in everything. They are all that 
    exists, and everything else is a shimmering extension of Their own Invisible 
    Presence. They dwell in the space of Nothingness that separates this fourth-dimensional 
    world from the parallel world that exists side-by-side and beyond our own

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(So al-Gahzali is both right and 
  wrong, and both perfect and imperfect in his own perceptions, when he says):</font><b> 
  His nearness no more resembles the nearness of objects to one another than His 
  entity resembles the entities of objects. He does not indwell in anything, nor 
  anything indwell in Him. He is as exalted above containment in space as He is 
  above confinement in time. He was, before creating time and space, and is now 
  even as He was</b>. <b>He is distinguished from His creation by His attributes. 
  There is nothing in His entity other than Him, nor is His entity in what is 
  other than Him. He is beyond change and motion: events neither occur within 
  Him nor changes befall Him. He remains in His attributes of majesty exalted 
  above change, and in the attributes of His perfection beyond needing any increase 
  in perfection.</b> <b>The existence of His entity is known by human reason, 
  and in the afterlife is beheld by the eyesight of the righteous as a beatitude 
  and favor, to consummate their perfect joy with the sight of His Noble Countenance.</b></p>
<p><b>His Life and Almighty Power </b></p>
<p><b>He Most High is living, almighty, overmastering, triumphant, unaffected 
  by inability or weakness; unsusceptible to drowsiness, sleep, annihilation, 
  or death; possessed of absolute sovereignty and might, of irresistible power 
  and force. His is the majesty and sway, the creation and command. The heavens 
  are enfolded in His right hand and all beings are powerless in His grasp. He 
  alone creates, begins, gives existence, and originates. He creates all beings 
  and their acts, ordains their sustenance and terms. Nothing possible is out 
  of His grasp, the disposal of no matter is beyond His power. The number of things 
  He can do is limitless, the amount He knows is infinite.</b></p>
<p><b>His Knowledge</b> </p>
<p><b>He knows all things knowable, encompassing all that takes place from the 
  depths of the earth to the highest heaven. He knows without an atom's weight 
  in the earth or heavens escaping His knowledge. He knows the creeping of a black 
  ant across a great stone on a lightless night, and the motion in the air of 
  a particle of dust on a windy day. He knows the concealed and the yet more hidden, 
  the buried recesses of hearts, the movement of thought, and the opacities of 
  the inmost soul; with preeternal, beginningless knowledge that He has always 
  possessed from the limitless reaches of past eternity, not with awareness originating 
  within Him through being imparted or conveyed.</b></p>
<p><b>His Will</b></p>
<p><b>He Most High wills all that exists and directs all events. Nothing occurs 
  in the physical or spiritual world, be it meager or much, little or great, good 
  or evil, of benefit or detriment, faith or unbelief, knowledge or ignorance, 
  triumph or ruin, increase or decrease, obedience or sin; save through His ordinance, 
  apportionment, wisdom, and decision. What He wills is, and what He does not 
  will is not. Neither sidelong glance nor passing thought is beyond His design. 
  He originates all and returns it, does what He wills, and none can repulse His 
  command. There is no rescinding His destiny, no flight for a servant from disobeying 
  Him except through divinely given success therein and mercy, and no strength 
  to obey Him save through His choice and decree. If all mankind, jinn, angels, 
  and devils combined their efforts to move or to still a single particle of the 
  universe without His will and choice, they would be unable to. His will, like 
  His other attributes, exists in His entity and He ever possesses it. He has 
  willed from preeternity the existence of all things at the times He has chosen. 
  They occur at the times which He has destined from beginingless eternity, occurring 
  neither before nor after, but taking place in accordance with His knowledge 
  and will, without substitution or alteration. He directs events without successive 
  thoughts or waiting for time to elapse, which is why nothing diverts Him from 
  anything else</b>.</p>
<p><b>His Hearing and Sight</b></p>
<p><b>He Most High is all-hearing and all-seeing. He hears and sees, no sound 
  however slight eluding His hearing, and no sight however minute escaping His 
  vision. Distance does not obscure His hearing nor darkness hinder His vision. 
  He sees without pupil or eyelids, and hears without ear canal or ears, just 
  as He knows without a heart, seizes without limb, and creates without implement. 
  His attributes no more resemble the attributes of His creatures than His entity 
  resembles the entity of His creatures.</b></p>
<p><b>His Speech</b></p>
<p><b>He Most High speaks, commands, forbids, promises, and warns with beginninglessly 
  eternal speech that is an attribute of His entity, not resembling the speech 
  of creatures in being a sound generated by the passage of air or impact of bodies 
  nor in letters articulated by compressing the lips or moving the tongue. The 
  Koran, Torah, Evangel, and Psalms are His Books, revealed to His messengers 
  (upon whom be peace). The Koran is recited with tongues, written in books, and 
  memorized in hearts despite being beginninglessly eternal, an attribute of the 
  entity of Allah Most High, unsubject to disseverance and separation by conveyance 
  to hearts or pages. Moses (Allah bless him and give him peace) heard the speech 
  of Allah without sound or letter, just as the righteous see the entity of Allah 
  Most High in the afterlife without substance or accident.</b></p>
<p><b>Since Allah possesses all of the above attributes, He is living, knowing, 
  omnipotent, willing, hearing, seeing, and speaking by virtue of His life, power, 
  knowledge, will, hearing, sight, and speech, not merely by virtue of His entity.</b></p>
<p><b>His Acts</b></p>
<p><b>Everything besides Him Glorious and Exalted exists through His action, proceeding 
  from His justice in the best, fullest, most perfect and equitable way. He is 
  wise in His acts and just in His decrees. His justice is not comparable to the 
  justice of His servants, since injustice may only be imagined from a servant 
  through his disposal of what belongs to another, while this is inconceivable 
  from Allah Most High, since nothing belongs to anyone besides Him that He should 
  unjustly dispose of it. </b></p>
<p><b>Everything besides Him, be it human, jinn, angel, devil, heaven, earth, 
  animal, vegetable, mineral, substance, accident, intelligible, or sensory, is 
  contingent, and was brought into existence through His power after not being, 
  created by Him after it was nothing. He alone existed in preeternity, and nothing 
  else. He then originated creation, that His omnipotence might be manifest, His 
  prior decree effected and His eternal word realized; not from needing or requiring 
  anything in creation. Our origination, beginning, and responsibility are of 
  Allah's generosity, not because of their being obligatory for Him, and His blessings 
  and benefaction exist because of His favor, not because of being due from Him. 
  Everything that exists is indebted to Him for His generosity and goodness, His 
  blessings and benevolence; for He is well able to pour all manner of torments 
  upon His servants and try them with every variety of suffering and illness, 
  and were He to do so, it would be just on His part and not wicked or unfair. 
  He Mighty and Majestic rewards His servants, the believers, for their acts of 
  obedience because of His generosity and in fulfillment of His word, not because 
  of their deserving it or His owing it to them. He is not obliged to anyone to 
  do anything, nor is injustice on His part conceivable, for He does not owe any 
  rights to anyone. The obligation of men and jinn to perform acts of obedience 
  is established by His having informed them of it upon the tongues of the prophets 
  (upon whom be peace), and not by unaided human reason. He sent the prophets 
  and manifested the truth of their messages by unmistakable, inimitable miracles. 
  They have communicated His commands, prohibitions, promises, and warnings, and 
  it is obligatory for mankind and jinn to believe in what they have conveyed.

<p align="center"><b>THE NEW JERUSALEM</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg737a.gif" width="258" height="482"></p>
<p>[The following excerpt is taken from Making Today Count for Eternity by Kent 
  Crockett, Multnomah Publishers, 2001, pages </p>
<p><b>After the new earth is created, the new Jerusalem will be transferred from 
  heaven to earth. &quot;And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out 
  of heaven from God...&quot; (Rev. 21:2). The new Jerusalem, the capital of the 
  new earth</b>, is described as a cube of fifteen hundred miles long, wide and 
  high, or about half the area of the United States. Because the city is fifteen 
  hundred miles high, some people believe it will be structured in stories, one 
  layer upon another. The heavenly city is called by several names:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>The new Jerusalem (Rev. 3:12, 21:2) <br>
    The holy city (Rev. 21:2, 22:19) <br>
    The Jerusalem above (Gal. 4:26) <br>
    The city whose architect and builder is God (Heb. 11:10) <br>
    The city which God has prepared (Heb. 11:16) <br>
    The heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22) <br>
    The city of the living God (Heb. 12:22) <br>
    The city which is to come (Heb. 13:14) <br>
    My Father&#146;s house (John 14:1-3)</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Thousands of years ago, Abraham &quot;was looking for the city which has 
  foundations, whose architect and builder is God&quot; (Heb. 11:10). The writer 
  of Hebrews exhorts us, &quot;For here we do not have a lasting city, but we 
  are seeking the city which is to come&quot; (Heb. 13:14). God has prepared this 
  heavenly city for all who love him</b>. &quot;But as it is, they desire a better 
  country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called 
  their God; for He has prepared a city for them&quot; (Heb. 11:16). Jesus said 
  in his Father&#146;s house are many dwelling places, which he has prepared for 
  his followers (John 14:1-3). </p>
<p>Let&#146;s take a walk around the city, shall we? <b>The new Jerusalem is surrounded 
  by a wall with twelve gates, with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel written 
  on each gate. Revelation 21:21 tells us that each gate is a single pearl</b>. 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Matthew 13:45,46)</font>. </p>
<p>Notice the wall has twelve foundation stones, and on each stone are the names 
  of the twelve apostles. The Old Testament age is represented by names of the 
  twelve tribes on the gates, while the New Testament era is represented by names 
  of the twelve apostles on the foundation stones. <b>Both Old and New Testament 
  believers will dwell in the heavenly city</b>.</p>
<p><b>Brilliant light radiates out from the new Jerusalem because the glory of 
  God is its light source. The glow of the city illuminates the entire planet. 
  &quot;And the city has no need of the sun </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Christianity)</font><b> 
  or of the moon </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Judaism)</font><b> 
  to shine upon it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the 
  Lamb. And the nations shall walk by its light...&quot; (Rev. 21:23-24).</b> 
</p>
<p>The details about eternity are hazy at best, but let me tell you what I believe 
  will occur. The redeemed people from all periods of history will be the citizens 
  of the new earth. Although all of us will have a dwelling place in the new Jerusalem, 
  we will have responsibilities on the new earth outside the city. Evidently, 
  lots of traffic will go in and out of the city, to and from the new earth. I 
  believe that people will have assignments in different areas of the new earth, 
  which will be divided into nations. </p>
<p>There will not only be nations on the new earth, but also kings. &quot;The 
  kings of the earth will bring their glory into it&quot; (Rev. 21:24). Who are 
  these kings who enter into the city? Let&#146;s speculate a little further. 
  Kings are the highest authorities in countries, so these kings probably hold 
  the highest positions in the nations on the new earth. No doubt they represent 
  the most faithful servants of the Lord from this present earth. Jesus said, 
  <b>&quot;He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds until the end, to him I 
  will give authority over the nations&quot; (Rev. 2:26).</b> </p>
<p>In this future kingdom of God, some people will be selected to rule in these 
  high positions as kings. Didn&#146;t Jesus say that those who humble themselves 
  will be exalted (Luke 14:11)? Several times He told us the last will be first, 
  and that servants and slaves will be great in His kingdom. He also taught that 
  if we are faithful with a few things, He will put us in charge of many things 
  (Matt. 25:21). </p>
<p>Those who faithfully served God during their lives on earth will be promoted 
  to rule over nations, while others will be given authority over cities. Remember 
  the parable of the minas (&quot;pounds&quot; in KJV)? The faithful slaves were 
  rewarded by being placed in authority over cities. After the master received 
  a kingdom for himself, he put one slave in charge of ten cities and another 
  in charge of five cities. Could it be that Jesus actually meant literal cities--not 
  on this present earth, but on the new earth? Slaves in those days were never 
  put in charge of cities, so it&#146;s possible that he was referring to future 
  responsibilities in the kingdom of God. <b>I&#146;m not trying to form a doctrine 
  base on so few facts, but I find it fascinating to speculate how all the pieces 
  fit in this gigantic, eternal puzzle</b>.</p>
<p><b>When we work all this information into a composite sketch</b>, it might 
  look something like this: God will set up a government composed of different 
  ranks and positions. Nations will cover the earth, with kings in authority over 
  each one. <b>Jesus will be the &quot;King of kings&quot; and the &quot;Lord 
  of lords&quot; throughout eternity (Rev. 19:16)</b>. Positions throughout the 
  kingdom, from least to greatest, will be assigned according to how faithfully
