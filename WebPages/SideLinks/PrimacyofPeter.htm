  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><font size="+1">The Papal Encyclicals</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">That which the Prince of Shepherds and great 
      shepherd of the Sheep, Jesus Christ Our Lord, established in the person 
      of the Blessed Apostle Peter to secure the perpetual welfare and lasting 
      good of the Church, must, by the same institution, necessarily remain unceasingly 
      in the Church, which being founded upon the Rock, will stand firm until 
      the end of the world. For none can doubt, and it is known to all ages, that 
      the holy and Blessed Peter, the Prince and chief of the Apostles, the pillar 
      of faith and foundation of the Catholic Church, reeived the keys of the 
      kingdom from our Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour and Redeemer of mankind, 
      and lives, presides, and judges to this day, always in his successors the 
      Bishops of the Holy See in Rome, which was founded by him and consecrated 
      in his blood. Whence whoever succeeds to Peter in this see does by the institution 
      of Christ himself obtain the primacy of Peter over the whole Church. The 
      disposition made by Incarnate Truth <i>(dispositio veritatis)</i> therefore 
      remains, and Blessed Peter, abiding in the rock's strength which he received 
      <i>(in accepta fortitudine petrae perseverans)</i>, has not abandoned the 
      direction of the Church!...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">Hence we teach and declare that by the appointment 
      of Our Lord the Roman Church possesses a sovereignty of ordinary power over 
      all other churches, and that this power of jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff, 
      which is truly episcopal, is immediate; to which all, of whatsoever rite 
      and dignity, both pastors and faithful, both individually and collectively, 
      are bound, by their duty of hierarchical subordination and true obedience, 
      to submit, not only in amtters that belong to faith and morals, but also 
      in those that appertain to the discipline and government of the Church throughout 
      the world; so that the Church of Christ may be one flock under one supreme 
      pastor, through the preservation of unity, both of communion and of profession 
      of the same faith, with the Roman pontiff...</font> Dogmatic Canons and 
      Decrees, New York: The Devin-Adair Co; 1912, pp.247-49.</p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">And since, by the divine right of Apostolic 
      primacy, one Roman Pontiff is placed over the universal Church, We further 
      teach and declare that he is the supreme judge of the faithful, and that 
      in all causes the decision of which belongs to the Church recourse may be 
      had to his tribunal, but that none may reopen the judgment of the Apostolic 
      See, than whose authority there is no greater, nor can any lawfully review 
      its judgment.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">Therefore, faithfully adhering to the tradition 
      received from the beginning of the Christian faith, for the Glory of God 
      our Saviour, the exaltation of the Catholic religion, and the salvation 
      of the Christian people, with the approval of the sacred council, we teach 
      and define that it is a dogma divinely revealed: that the Roman pontiff, 
      when he speaks <i>ex cathedra, </i>(from the chair of St. Peter), that is, 
      when in discharge of the office of pastor and teacher of all Christians, 
      by virtue of his supreme Apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine regarding 
      faith or morals to be held by the universal Church, is, by the divine assistance 
      promised to him in Blessed Peter, possessed of that infallibility with which 
      the divine Redeemer willed that His church should be endowed in defining 
      doctrine regarding faith and morals; and that, therefore such definitions 
      of the Roman pontiff are of themselves, and not from the consent of the 
      Church, irreformable.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">Thus the pope is <i>infallible </i>only when 
      he defines a truth, or truths, that concern faith and morals. And this definition 
      is, in effect, a judgment; the pope distinguishes between a traditional 
      truth, implicitly or explicitly known, and a new error. And his definition, 
      in the judgment he thus makes, the pope always defines by negation: the 
      traditional phrase is, &quot;if anyone denies that (such and such) is the 
      truth...let him be anathema.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">And the truth defined is always part of the 
      tradition of the Church; it is to be found in the universal faith of one 
      particular period, past or present; it is contained in the historical development 
      of the Church. The pope, when defining, always does so in context, and always 
      sets forth the truth he defines in, and with, its whole background.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+1">Reasonings and Rationale</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">As to the authority of Papal encyclicals, 
      Monsignor Joseph Fenton writes in the <i>American Ecclesiastical Review</i>:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">It is quite probable that some of the teachings set forth 
        on the authority of the various papal encyclicals are infallible...</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Those who follow the papal pronouncements, especially 
        those of the last hundred years, will be impressed and astounded by the 
        many and wide fields of thought in which they seem at home. The reader 
        may even wonder how one man could amass such knoweledge on so many subjects. 
        Of course, it is well known that for all important pronouncements the 
        pope makes use of preparatory commissions of experts, whose findings, 
        and even formulations, are incorporated into papal documents.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Since it would be difficult to choose from among the 
        enormous bulk of papal documents accumulated during twenty centuries of 
        Church history those communications of a doctrinal and universal nature 
        having the form of an encyclical, and since such a choice would be arbitrary 
        and unprecedented, and might not be feasible, it has been thought preferable 
        for the purposes of t</font><font size="+1">his collection to give for 
        the period from the earliest time until 1740, a brief history of, and 
        examples from, what can be given the generic name of &quot;apostolic letters.&quot; 
        Only those have been included which were judgments--which influenced the 
        history of their times or of all time...</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Future historians and theologians will spend lifetimes in 
    the Library of the Past, restructuring the Nation-church's understanding of 
    history. With a perspective built around the unfolding revelations and spiritual 
    realities of our times, they will bring to light the true story of Christianity's 
    Dark side. It will include a full account of the Roman church's blatant apostasies, 
    its unholy marriage with the powers of this age, its own imperious rise to 
    power, its violations of the precepts of Christ which held that each soul 
    must <i>work out its own salvation</i>, (with a fear and trembling that issues 
    forth from one's own heart and not from the Office of the Inquisition), and 
    that none should make themselves <i>lords over God's people</i>, its violence 
    and murders in the name of Christ, and its deceptions--all of which has led 
    to the church's monumental inability to interpret the words of Peter or the 
    signs of our times:</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="+1">THE FALSE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font size="+1">Among the ways in which the Roman ecclesiasts fought 
        to free the Western church from political domination was to assert its 
        own sovereign territorial and political rights. One of the most ambitious 
        of such assertions was the so-called Donation of Constantine (eighth century), 
        a fraudulent document claiming papal succession to much of the old Roman 
        Empire:</font></i></p>
      <p><font size="+1">&quot;The Emperor Caesar Flavius Constantinus in Christ 
        Jesus...to the most Holy and blessed Father of fathers, Silvester, Bishop 
        of the Roman city and Pope; and to all his successors, the pontiffs, who 
        shall sit in the chair of blessed Peter to the end of time...Grace, peace, 
        love, joy, long-suffering, mercy...be with you all...For we wish you to 
        know...that we have forsaken the worship of idols...and have come to the 
        purest Christian faith...</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">To the holy apostles, my lords the most blessed Peter 
        and Paul, and through them also to blessed Silvester, our father, supreme 
        pontiff and univeral pope of the city of Rome, and to the pontiffs his 
        successors, who to the end of the world shall sit in the seat of blessed 
        Peter, we grant and by this present we convey our imperial Lateran palace, 
        which is superior to and excels all palaces in the whole world; and further 
        the diadem, which is the crown of our head; and the miter; as also the 
        super-humeral, that is, the stole which usually surrounds our imperial 
        neck, and the purple cloak and the scarlet tunic and all the imperial 
        robes...</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">And we decree that those most reverend men, the clergy 
        of various orders serving the same most holy Roman Church, shall have 
        that eminence, distinction, power, and precedence, with which our illustrious 
        senate is gloriously adorned; that is, they shall be made patricians and 
        consuls. And we ordain that they shall also be adorned with other imperial 
        dignities. Also we decree that the clergy of the sacred Roman Church shall 
        be adorned as are the imperial officers...</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">We convey to the oft-mentioned and most blessed Silvester, 
        universal pope, both our palace, as preferment, and likewise all provinces, 
        palaces and districts of the city of Rome and Italy and of the regions 
        of the West; and bequeathing them to the power and sway of him and the 
        pontiffs, his successors, we do determine and decree that the same be 
        placed at his disposal, and do lawfully grant it as a permanent possession 
        to the Holy Roman Church.&quot;</font></p>
