      CRY</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shabbat Yom Kippur</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm waiting for the magic 
    moment of 'Ne'illah,' once the moment when the temple gates closed on fast 
    days and still Yom Kippur's glorious finale. I remember how, as a kid, when 
    I had to water the lawn, I would pinch tight the rubber hose while moving 
    the sprinkler...As the 'Ne'hillah' darkness gathers, I think that maybe God 
    is similarly pinching off the Sunlight by slowly swinging shut the gates of 
    heaven. But even as night fills the synagogue, my Havdalah candle pierces 
    the darkness, and I remember that the High Holy Days season began with the 
    liturgical addition of Psalm 27: 'God is my light, whom shall I fear?' The 
    light that comes from knowing I am in God's presence cannot dim. It lights 
    the way to eternity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then there is the Shofar...Throughout 
    the preparatory month of Elul, it closed each morning service. Service preparations 
    at the Hebrew Union College where I teach is ringed round with rules about 
    who is assigned to do what, and how; but the blowing of the Shofar seems to 
    happen spontaneously. Maybe Shofar blowers are heaven-sent--who knows? They 
    show up from nowhere and discharge me to my chores...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rabbis likened the Shofar sound 
    to a Woman Crying Out in Labor. 'Hayom harat olam' we say, when we hear it 
    blown on Rosh Hashanah. 'This is the day of the world's birth.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes when the sound really 
    carries, I think it is the voice of God, whom I picture as our Mother giving 
    birth to the universe. My little backyard garden plot is slowly dying these 
    days, but the world is being reborn, spanking new, and me along with it--there's 
    the miracle! 'Mother,' I say--my first-found words of gratitude in my new 
    world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On second thought, it occurs to 
    me that 'hayom harat olam' means 'This is the day the world is conceived.' 
    Yes, that's it! The world is reborn on Rosh Hashanah. It is conceived then, 
    It remains in utero for a while, while we imagine its infinite possibilities. 
    What might we amount to if we really try? 'How many are your works, O God! 
    And I among them!' Count forward from the second day of Rosh Hashanah to Yom 
    Kippur, and you get exactly Nine days, a reminder of the pregnant hope gestating 
    in some Divine Womb and waiting to spill out only with Yom Kippur.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These Days of Repentance, I think, 
    have been days of labor: God's labor and my own. When Yom Kippur finally dawns, 
    GOD WILL GIVE BIRTH TO ANOTHER WORLD, looking very much like the one already 
    here, but don't let appearances fool you. The thing about a Baby world is 
    that it has yet to grow up; who knows what it can learn to do? On Yom Kippur 
    I sing with special gusto, 'Chadesh yameinu kakadem' 'O God, renew my days 
    as of old!' I work at confessing my sins from the world just ending, and I 
    prepare to be reconstituted anew...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the last and longest blast 
    is...a primal shout of triumph announcing actual birth: 'L'chaim! To life 
    renewed, vision restored, hope rekindled!'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is why I wait for 'Ne'illah:' 
    it is the Havdalah moment when a single candle lights up the dark, and the 
    birthing sound of 'tekiyah gedolah' rings in my ears.&quot; </font>Lawrence

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Unlike a recent debate on the Donahue Show on the topic of 
  sexuality, teenage pregnancy and the issue of sex education in the schools versus 
  the Conservative (and Bush administration)-backed alternative--celibacy-until-marriage, 
  where neither of the speakers wished to allow the other their point, or their 
  time to complete it, there was a very timely and more substantive discussion 
  this morning on the Freespeech Television channel. WBAI's Amy Goodman was the 
  moderator, and the topic was abortion. She interviewed two advocates, Elizabeth 
  Cavendish of the National Pro-Choice movement, and Olivia Gans of the National 
  Right-To-Life Association. Although Amy Goodman's sentiments are (we assume), 
  for political and philosophical reasons, those of the pro-choice movement's, 
  she led a generally balanced and pointed discussion and allowed Olivia Gans 
  to articulate (which she did) the positions of the Right-To-Life movement. But 
  why, we want to ask, can not the two sides come together? Why are the two hell-bent 
  as it is on carrying their separate points of view right into the middle of 
  the impending world crises...without recognizing the glaring fallacies and inconsistencies 
  that attend each of their positions, or, for that matter, the strength in each 
  others resonings where they exist? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Right to Choose? Of course, the right to be in charge of 
  one's own mind and body (the empire of one's very own existence), which naturally 
  includes all of one's own conscious decisions, and control over one's own sexual 
  desires and reproductive capabilities, without interference from the greater, 
  clearly-also immoral, largely male-dominated and imperiously conservative, self-righteous 
  order that has risen over us. We ask, who gave this political order the authority 
  to rule over others? When did they aquire it? And by what means? The God of 
  History would have us understand that it was by violence and bloodshed, by rebellion, 
  by killing and destroying--by means far removed from their own pretenses about 
  the sanctity of Life. And then we ask: the right to choose what? More death? 
  To be in league with it? With them? To add to the already-monstrous toll of 
  sacrificial victims in the earth? For the right to dishonor the Mother of Life 
  Herself, to demonstrate that the maternal environment into which the soul has 
  been conceived can be as hostile to the life of that soul as the American empire 
  is to the life and well-being of the entire planet? Even in the midst of personal 
  anguish and conflict the right to choose must be distinguished from the actual 
  choices we make, <i>For as the soul thinks, so is it</i>...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Forget about the technical and legal (the basically evil, wholly 
  materialistic and humanistic) arguments that seek to determine when a fetus 
  is a child and not some soulless mass of biological tissue. Every spiritually-conscious 
  person realizes that the very spark of life itself is Divine (the very thought 
  of Life is Divine), and that the merger of egg and sperm (moved by mystical 
  forces in themselves) only facilitates and provides the genetic instructions 
  for another Tree of Life to take root in the earth (a human Child), one whose 
  seed was already planted in the fertile and future soil of human consciousness 
  even before human conception began. Olivia Gans (of Right to Life) wonders why 
  Ms. Cavendish (Pro-Choice) is so impervious to these spiritual realities, and 
  so willfully (or perhaps just ignorantly) unmindful of the true meaning of Life--another 
  strident <i>feminist</i> trying to overthrow the rule of a Father God as she 
  is--that she so actively and callously militates and counsels against it...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/WondrousChild3.jpg" width="315" height="343"></p>
<p><font size="+1">On the other hand, Ms. Cavendish would have Olivia Gans see 
  that her garment is not <i>seamless</i>. In fact, that it is as bloodstained 
  as any abortion clinic doctor's. She would have Gans see that she is in bed 
  with hypocrites (with the antichrists of the earth themselves), with a political 
  and religious order whose lofty rhetoric does not conceal its own evil deeds; 
  one that is actively responsible for creating and perpetuating the social and 
  economic conditions in people's lives that lead them to fall aside and choose 
  death over life; one that speaks of the sanctity of life in the morning but 
  will unmercifully destroy it to further its own earthly ends at the end of day. 
  It is against abortion it says, but will afterwards subject the born child (not 
  its own of course) to the rigours of oppression, injustice and despair. It is 
  against abortion it says, but the integrity of this position collapses when 
  it comes to issues of capital punishment (the most unmerciful among them are 
  for it), after the born child has fallen into all of the social traps that have 
  been set before it. (Why is there crime below, in the streets and among the 
  people? For the very simple reason that there is crime above--grand theft and 
  murder abounds--as it is also written: <i>spiritual wickedness in high places</i>. 
  As the <i>Mind</i> thinks the <i>Body</i> acts. As the government is, so are 
  the people). It is against abortion it says, but has slaughtered millions in 
  its <i>religious</i> wars (not to fail to mention those countless numbers it 
  has tortured and maimed for their refusal to participate in such evil deeds). 
  It wants the child alive so that it can either convert it into one of themselves, 
  or use it as a pawn in its own defense, and more particularly now as it continues 
  to engage God in the age-ending wars that are now being visited upon the earth. 
  Those who say they are for life, but are in the end for war as well, are in 
  serious conflict (both spiritually and mentally), with their own natural minds--about 
  the mysteries of Life and Death--and remain critically unaware of how the God 
  of Life is now rising up in the affairs of the world to separate the children 
  of one from the children of the other: </font></p>

    can in fact be traced to remote Indian antiquity, that existence consists 
    not in linear progressive development--that is, in 'history' </font>(which 
    it does, also)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--but in constant 
    cyclical repetition of primordial and archetypal events. When major upheavals 
    occurred, it was promptly supposed that the cycle was nearing its end, that 
    the Great Year was at hand, and that cosmos was about to revert to chaos, 
    </font>(or vice-versa)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. The primordial 
    elements, restrained and regulated at the beginning of the world, would again 
    be unleashed; all things would dissolve in an overwhelming deluge </font>(war)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    or be burned in that everlasting fire which rages in the depths of the earth, 
    </font>(which rages in the depths of man's natural, unregenerated heart)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Then the cycle would begin again; a new world would be brought to birth.&quot;

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The hymns represent the most 
    original literary creation in the Dead Sea Scriptures...Especially noteworthy 
    is the prevalence in these hymns of the vocabulary which Evelyn Underhill 
    and others have recognized as the standard and characteristic idioms of mystical 
    experiences. There is the same harping on the wilderness of isolation; the 
    same reference to the 'ascent' to God and to the 'height of eternal things'; 
    the same metaphor (particularly in Hymn No. 5) of the New Birth and 'the travail 
    of the world'; the same intensive apprehension of Divine Providence, communion 
    and 'enlightenment'; and the same sense of nursing a precious secret against 
    the Day of Revelation...&quot; </font>The Dead Sea Scriptures, p.120<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
