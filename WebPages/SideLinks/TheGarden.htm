    <p align="left"><font size="+1">&quot;It would be a mistake to suppose that 
      the writers of the Scrolls...were inspired only by recollections of things 
      past or that they chose their way of life simply because they were unsettled 
      by political turbulence or disgusted by the venality of the Jerusalemitan 
      priests. They were swept by other winds. One of these was the widespread 
      and well-attested contemporary belief that the Great Cycle of the ages was 
      about to complete its revolution. This belief was based on a conception, 
      which can be traced to remote Indian antiquity, that existence consists 
      not in linear progressive development--that is, in history, <font size="3">(which 
      it does)</font>--but in a constant cyclic repetition of primordial and archetypal 
      events. When major upheavals occurred, it was promptly supposed that the 
      cycle was nearing its end, that the Great Year was at hand, and that cosmos 
      was about to revert to chaos. The primal elements, restrained and regulated 
      at the beginning of the world, would again be unleashed; all things would 
      dissolve in an overwhelming deluge (war) or be burned in that everlasting 
      fire which rages in the depths of the earth. Then the cycle would begin 
      again; a new world would be brought to birth.&quot; </font>The Dead Sea

      God loves knowledge. Wisdom and sound sense has He posted before Him. Prudence 
      and knowledge minister to Him. Patience attends on Him and abundant forgiveness, 
      so that He may (deliver) the repentant. But also with Him are might and 
      power and great wrath, along with flames of fire and all the angels of destruction--appointed 
      for them that turn aside from His way and treat His ordanances as a thing 
      to be shunned, to the end that they shall be left without remnant or survival.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">Never, from the very beginning of the world, 
      has God approved of such men. He has always known what their actions would 
      be, even before the foundations of them were laid. He has anathematized 
      whole generations on account of bloodshed, hiding His face from the land. 
      Their end has always been pre-determined. He has always known how long they 
      would endure, and the exact and precise extent of their continuance...all

      of the Menorah's origin should have become an object of research only in 
      more recent times, whereas attempts at interpretation have occurred at practically 
      all periods. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">In general it may be said that most scholars 
      now seem to suppose that the Menorah originated from a Sacred Tree, more 
      specifically the Tree of Life of mythology--a primal image which can be 
      glimpsed as early as the third millennium B.C. in the epic of <i>Gilgamesh 
      and the Land of the Living</i>, and which played a decisive role in the 
      Tree cult of the ancient world.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">Closely akin to this image and at times identical 
      with it was the presumably older myth of a cosmic tree or World Tree, usually 
      conceived at the center of the earth--sometimes on a Cosmic Mountain of 
      the Gods--with its roots in the Underworld (the realm of the Dead) and its 
      crown in Heaven (realm of the Gods). In short, a sort of imaginary <i>axis 
      mundi </i>or World Pillar whose boughs, as Carlyle said of <i>Yggdrasil</i>, 
      are 'Histories of Nations,' its every leaf 'a biography,' every fiber 'an 
      act or word.'...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="+1">In Mesoptamia this was elaborated with the 
      notion that the Divine Tree grew in the mythical Paradise at the source 
      of the Water of Life, where it was guarded and tended for the chief deity 
      by the primordial Man-King. In the ritual, the temple came to represent 
      the deity's 'heavenly dwelling,' the temple grove with the Sacred Tree the 
      legendary Paradise, and the sacral King as the deity's representative its 
      Gardener. <font size="3">(continued)</font>...</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="+1">&quot;No less interesting is the parallel 
      between the Temple as an image of the 'heavenly dwelling' and the sanctuary

      midst. According to all that I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle, 
      and of all its furniture, so shall ye make it,' a reference to heavenly 
      'patterns' also repeated, as we have seen, in the separate command concerning 
      the menorah...</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="+1">It may be added that Christian royal sceptres 
      have largely the same derivation, and the cross on the orb (also the earth's 
      astronomical sign) symbolizes nothing other than a Tree of Life growing 
      at the Center of the Earth. This identification of the cross with the Tree 
      of Life or Christ himself--the shoot from the stump of Jesse--becomes especially 
      popular in medieval literature. It presumably also lies behind the Christmas

    <p><b>Babylon was originally so settled. An ancient map shows it at the center 
      of a vast circular countryside bordered by a river, 'precisely as the Sumerians 
      envisioned Paradise.' Indeed the sacred city takes on the character of the 
      country surrounding it. Hebrew and Christian writers frequently used the 
      terms 'Jerusalem' and 'Paradise' interchangeably. Thus Baruch, in the Syriac 
      Apocalypse, has God complain of worldly Jerusalem. 'This building now built 
      in your midst is not that which is revealed with Me, that which was prepared 
      beforehand here from the time I took counsel to make Paradise, and showed

    <p><b>Since the earthly, temporal city is always corrupt, progress is thought

      geographical search for the 'center.' The many journey patterns of antiquity 
      and modern times represent...a search for paradise, which is in part regressive.

      whose waters opened a gateway to the promised land. The Babylonian exile

    <p><b>The passion play was a product of Roman domination heaped upon a heritage

    <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">THE 
      SACRED TREE</font></p>
    <p align="center"><b>Dedicated to the countless clans, tribes and nation of 
      indigenous peoples throughout Mother Earth whose sacred visions, dreams, 
      prayers, songs, wisdom, experience and kind guidance form the Foundation 
      and living reality of the Sacred Tree.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">For all 
      the people of the earth, the Creator has planted a Sacred Tree under which 
      they may gather, and there find healing, power, wisdom and security. The 
      roots of this Tree spread deep into the body of Mother Earth. Its branches 
      reach upward like hands praying to Father Sky. The fruits of this Tree are 
      the good things the Creator has given to His people: teachings that show 
      the path to love, compassion, generosity, patience, wisdom, justice, courage, 
      respect, humility and many other gifts.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The ancient 
      ones taught us that the life of the Tree is the life of the people. If the 
      people wander far away from the protective shadow of the Tree, if they forget 
      to seek the nourishment of its fruit, or if they should turn against the 
      Tree and attempt to destroy it, great sorrow will fall upon the people. 
      Many will become sick at heart. The people will lose their power. They will 
      cease to dream dreams and see visions. They will begin to quarrel among 
      themselves over worthless trifles. They will become unable to tell the truth 
      and to deal with each other honestly. They will forget how to survive in 
      their own land. Their lives will become filled with anger and gloom. Little 
      by little they will poison themselves and all they touch.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It was 
      foretold that these things would come to pass, but that the Tree would never 
      die. And as long as the Tree lives, the people live. It was also foretold 
      that the day would come when the people would awaken, as if from a long 
      drugged sleep; that they would begin, timidly at first but then with great 
      urgency, to search again for the Sacred Tree.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The knowledge 
      of its whereabouts, and of the fruits that adorn its branches have always 
      been carefully guarded and preserved within the minds and hearts of our 
      wise elders and leaders. These humble, loving and dedicated souls will guide 
      anyone who is honestly and sincerely seeking along the path leading to the 
      protecting shadow of the Sacred Tree.</font></p>

      Symbol of the Sacred Tree</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Sacred 
      Tree as a symbol of life-giving meaning is of vital importance to the indigenous 
      peoples of the earth. For countless generations it has provided meaning 
      and inspiration for many tribes and nations. The Sacred Tree is a symbol 
      around which lives, religions, beliefs and nations have been organized. 
      It is a symbol of profound depth, capable of providing enough meaning for 
      a lifetime of reflection.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Sacred 
      Tree represents life, cycles of time, the earth, and the universe. The meaning 
      of the Sacred Tree reflects the teachings of the Medicine Wheel. The center 
      of the Medicine Wheel is the symbolic center of creation and of the tribe. 
      This meaning is reflected in a song which is sung on behalf of the Sacred 
      Tree chosen for the Sun Dance.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Symbolically, the Sacred 
      Tree represents a gathering place for the many different tribes and peoples 
      of the world. The Sacred Tree provides a place of protection in the world, 
      a place of peace, contemplation, and centering. Like our mother's womb which 
      provided nourishment and protection during the earliest days of our life, 
      the Sacred Tree may be thought of as a womb of protection which gives birth 
      to our values and potentialities as unique human beings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The process of developing 
      our uniqueness through the teachings of the Sacred Tree gives rise to a 
      vision, not of what we are, but of what we can become. That vision becomes 
      the path toward our wholeness. Thus we see in the symbolic protection of 
      the Sacred Tree the beginning of our wholeness and the emergance of the 
      seed of our potential.&quot;</font></p>
