<p align="center">Presbyterians Divest Themselves From Israel<br>
  By Nathan Guttman <br>

<p>WASHINGTON - The Presbyterian Church's 216th General Assembly caught American 
  Jewish organizations off guard and by surprise. The Presbyterians have never 
  concealed their criticism of Israeli policies in the territories, but years 
  of dialogue between Jews and Presbyterians had created an impression of an understanding 
  between the communities.</p>
<p> Hence U.S. Jewish leaders were astonished to find that the Presbyterian Church 
  has adopted the most censorious decisions ever embraced by any Christian denomination 
  in the United States against Israel. The Presbyterian Church has three million 
  American members and is one of the strongest denominations in the country. This 
  time it did more than issue declarations condemning Israel's occupation of the 
  territories. In a precedent setting decision, it took practical steps to halt 
  investments in Israel, and to discourage contacts with companies that do business 
  in Israel. <br>
</p>
<p>Divestment decisions regarding Israel have in the past three years been reached 
  by academic and research bodies in the U.S., but these have mostly been small 
  institutions with limited economic clout. Their calls for divestment have had 
  a marginal economic impact. Now, for the first time, a significant religious 
  entity that controls large sums of money and commands the beliefs of millions 
  of followers has called for the imposition of economic sanctions on Israel. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>&quot;By reaching this decision we want to make sure that we are not investing 
  in activities of the kind we are trying to prevent. We see so much violence, 
  and we want to assure ourselves that we have nothing to do with it,&quot; said 
  Jay Rock, coordinator for Interfaith Relations at the Presbyterian church. Rock 
  said the new divestment policy is motivated by more than a desire to insulate 
  and detach Presbyterians from the violent Israeli-Palestinian dispute - his 
  church also has an affirmative desire to &quot;make our voice heard about the 
  direction of Israeli policy.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>The Presbyterian General Assembly convenes once every two years. The recent 
  meeting was held in Richmond, Virginia. As is customary, a human rights survey 
  was presented at the assembly and the report accused Israel of human rights 
  violations in the territories. The divestment proposal was forwarded by a Presbyterian 
  delegate from Florida. The assembly's Peacemaking Committee confirmed the proposal, 
  and brought it to the floor of the assembly plenum for a vote. The decision 
  to divest from Israel was passed by a resounding majority of 431 to 62. <br>

<p>Tracking Caterpillar <br>
</p>
<p>Israeli delegates were not invited to speak at the Presbyterian General Assembly. 
  Rev. Mitri Raheb, from Bethlehem, appeared before the delegates. This Bethlehem 
  cleric urged the Presbyterians to sever economic ties with Israel. He singled 
  out the tractor manufacturer Caterpillar, saying its products are used to raze 
  Palestinian houses on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Sources in the Presbyterian 
  Church said this week that they do not know whether their church has investments 
  in Caterpillar. The Presbyterian decision is economically significant. Well-informed 
  sources say the Presbyterian Church commands more than seven billion dollars 
  worth of financial instruments and pension funds. Most of this money is invested 
  in companies and now, in keeping with the divestment decision, Presbyterian 
  delegates will review each company's records to ascertain whether it has ties 
  with Israel. <br>
</p>
<p>According to the General Assembly decision, any company which earns more than 
  $1 million annually as a result of investments in Israel, or which invests more 
  than $1 million a year in Israel, will be entered on a blacklist prepared for 
  the church's leaders - the Presbyterians are likely to divest from any company 
  that appears on this list. <br>
</p>
<p>While the Presbyterian decision's likely economic impact is not negligible, 
  the American Jewish community is more concerned about the principle inherent 
  in the policy. &quot;This is a new phase of aggressive behavior in the expression 
  of their feelings toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,&quot; said Rabbi 
  Gary Bretton-Granatoor, Interfaith Director for the Anti-Defamation League. 
  <br>
  He said that while the ADL and other American Jewish organizations maintain 
  contacts with the Presbyterian church, the denomination's leaders did not inform 
  the American Jewish leadership about preparations for the divestment policy 
  - nor did the Presbyterians give the organized American Jewish community a chance 
  to respond to the developments at their General Assembly. <br>
</p>
<p>Along with ADL National Director Abraham Foxman, Rabbi Bretton-Granatoor sent 
  a strongly worded letter to the leader of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S., 
  Dr. Clifton Kirkpatrick, saying that they feel hurt by the General Assembly's 
  divestment decision. They criticized the Presbyterians for drawing a comparison 
  between the situation in Israel and former apartheid South Africa. The letter 
  also attacked a call by the Presbyterians for an end to construction of the 
  separation fence. <br>
</p>
<p>Despite the Presbyterian divestment decision in Richmond, many American Jewish 
  leaders point out that there has been productive cooperation with this church, 
  particularly in the realm of human rights. &quot;Up to 1967 they were Israel's 
  best friends, because they always support the underdog,&quot; says Bretton-Granatoor. 
  &quot;After that they started seeing Israel as a superpower.&quot; <br>
  Directed divestment <br>
</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the storm over the divestment decision, the Presbyterian 
  church plans to issue a clarifying statement soon, saying that it will not boycott 
  every company that has investments in Israel, or earns profits from business 
  with Israel. <br>
  The intention is to provide boycott exemptions to companies or entities which 
  deal in education, social welfare and construction in Israel. The Presbyterians 
  want to direct the divestment policy toward &quot;companies that might cause 
  damage and hurt the peace process,&quot; as Jay Rock phrases it. <br>
</p>
<p>In parallel, an effort will be made to mend breaches with the Jewish community. 
  Up to now, American Jewish professionals complain, Presbyterian replies to objections 
  about the new divestment policy have been evasive and unsatisfactory. <br>
  &quot;We need to engage and think together how these two communities, which 
  both want to bring peace to the region, can think together about ways to do 
  it,&quot; says Rock. He said: &quot;It's clear that tension exists right now, 
  but I hope that an opportunity for dialogue will emerge from this.&quot; Yet, 
  the thrust of statements made by Rock's counterpart, ADL Interfaith director 
  Bretton-Granatoor, casts doubt on this hope of future dialogue. &quot;It is 
  accepted that reasonable people will ask questions and be critical - but they 
  have proposed drastic measures and a blanket approach, without trying to balance 
  or consult with the other side,&quot; Bretton-Granatoor says. <br>
</p>
<p>Unlike other denominations in the U.S., the Presbyterian church does not have 
  a mass membership. Yet it is considered a highly influential church, largely 
  because its members include people with clout in spheres such as politics and 
  economics. <br>
  In recent years, the pro-Israel community in America has come to rely increasingly 
  on the support of the Evangelical church, which has a mass following of some 
  50 million believers and whose leaders are outspoken proponents of Israel's 
  right to occupy the territories, at least until the Second Coming. This &quot;Christian 
  Zionism&quot; approach was criticized at the Presbyterian General Assembly which 
  concluded that it has no clear theological foundation. <br>
</p>
<p>Will the Presbyterian decision encourage other denominations to adopt divestment 
  policies? American Jewish leaders do not seem concerned about such a falling 
  of dominoes. The Catholic Church, the largest Christian group in the U.S. and 
  the world, is currently drawing closer to Israel. Various Protestant denominations 
  in the U.S. periodically criticize Israeli policies in the territories but do 
  not seem to have divestment decisions on their agenda. </p>
<p>Another decision reached by the Presbyterian General Assembly has little to 
  do with Israel, but has incensed the American Jewish community. By a 260 to 
  233 vote, the assembly authorized continued funding and support for the Avodat 
  Yisrael church in Philadelphia, which tries to convert Jews to Christianity. 
  Jewish activists have in the past demanded that this missionary group, which 
  describes its purposes as &quot;messianic,&quot; desist from its activities 
  - they have objected that Avodat Yisrael uses duplicitous tactics - among other 
  things, allegedly posing as a Jewish institution. http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/454513.html<br>
