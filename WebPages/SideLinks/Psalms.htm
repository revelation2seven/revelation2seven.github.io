  <p><i>Blessed is the man that walketh NOT in the counsel of the ungodly, nor 
    standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the Seat of the scornful.</i></p>
  <p><i>BUT HIS DELIGHT IS IN THE LAW OF THE LORD; AND IN HIS LAW DOTH HE MEDITATE 
    NIGHT AND DAY.</i></p>
  <p><i>AND HE SHALL BE LIKE A TREE PLANTED BY THE RIVERS OF WATER, THAT BRINGETH 
    FORTH FRUIT IN HIS SEASON; his leaf shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth 
    shall prosper.</i></p>
  <p><i>The ungodly are not so...For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: 
    but the way of the ungodly shall perish...</i>(Psalm 1).</p>

    there is none that doeth good, no not one.</i></p>
  <p><i>Their throat is an open sepelchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; 
    the poison of asps is under their lips;</i></p>
