<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">The following excerpt is from the aggadic <i>Chapters of Rabbi 
  Eliezer the Great</i>, &quot;The Revelation on Sinai:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Rabbi Chanina said: In the 
    third month the day is double the night, and the Israelites slept until two 
    hours of the day, for sleep on the day of the feast of Azereth (Pentecost) 
    is pleasant, the night being short. And Moses went forth and came to the camp 
    of the Israelites, and he aroused them from their sleep, for behold, your 
    God desires to give the Torah to you. Already the bridegroom wished to lead 
    the bride and enter the bridal chamber. The hour has come for giving you the 
    Torah, as it is said, &quot;And Moses brought forth the people out of the 
    camp to meet God.' (Exodus 19:17).&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The translator of this work into English says: &quot;This is 
  one of the most interesting expressions in the whole of our book. The longest 
  day is twice as long as the shortest at latitude 49-degrees in northern Asia...Can 
  we locate the place where this fact applies in connection with these chapters? 
  Or is it merely a further instance of dependence of these Chapters on the Pseudepigrapha?&quot; 
  (p.322). Forty nine degrees, North latitude? It runs almost directly through 
  Vienna, Austria. (Again, we must recall that this Rabbi Eliezer was excommunicated 
  in his time from the Rabbinic circle, for going over to the Jewish Essenes, 
  for helping them, as it were, to transmit their mysteries and to <i>turn the 
  world upside down</i>. Acts 17:6).</font></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="+1">The point to be made here is that the Hebrew mysteries comprehend 
  the whole Earth (and that the Universal Hebrew race is comprised of all the 
  peoples of the earth who can find their way back to the Center of the Greater 
  Mystery through the structure and the dimensions of their own religious traditions), 
  It is also true that all any of us have understood of these mysteries up to 
  now has either been revealed to us, or concealed from us, by the Divine Mother 
  who is Holy Wisdom Herself. She has wrapped Herself in many different garments, 
  among them were those of Venus, the Goddess of Beauty, who is also (according 
  to all the hidden precepts of the Tree of Life) Jerusalem Herself--the Morning 
  and the Evening Star. Or we could reason that She was wrapped in the garments 
  of Venus by others, and even kidnapped or spirited away by the lower reasonings 
  of the Gentile mind. (We rather think that she went purposefully, and mysteriously, 
  hiding the reality of it all in what we have come to call &quot;Greek myths.&quot; 
  In all events we discover She is also one with Europa who was stolen away by 
  Zeus and brought to the Island of Crete. We discover in these legends not only 
  the story of Europa's abduction, but fittingly enough how the name of this Mt. 
  Ida...IuDeA...Judaea...found its way to Crete also. </font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/IuDeA.gif" width="600" height="446"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Zeus, falling in love with 
    Europa, sent Hermes to drive Agenor's cattle down to the seashore at Tyre 
    where she and her companions used to walk. He himself joined the herd, disguised 
    as a snow-white Bull... Europa was struck by his beauty, and, on finding him 
    gentle as a lamb, mastered her fear and began to play with him...In the end 
    she climbed upon his shoulders, and let him amble down with her to he edge 
    of the sea. Suddenly he swam away, while she looked back in terror at the 
    receding shore...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wading ashore near Cretan Gortyna, 
    Zeus became an eagle and ravished Europa in a willow thicket beside a spring; 
    or some say under an evergreen plane-tree. She bore him three sons.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zeus's rape of Europa recalls an 
    early Hellenic occupation of Crete...Hella bore the title &quot;Europa.&quot; 
    Her Corinthian and Cretan name was Hellotis, which suggests Helice (willow), 
    (Ezekiel 17:1-5). Helle and Helen are the same divine character. </font>The 
    Greek Myths, by Robert Graves, p.194<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The legend of Europa seems to have her being abducted from 
  that Phoenician port named Tyre (or Tyrus) on the Eastern Mediterranean shore, 
  but we will agree with those who placed the Phoenicians, thus the original Tyre, 
  out on the Atlantic Ocean. Strabo, speaking of those who he says &quot;confound 
  myth with history,&quot; says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And like them are the writers 
    who tell of the Sidonians on the Persian Gulf, or somewhere else on Oceanus, 
    and who place the wanderings of Menelaus, and likewise the Phoenicians out 
    on Oceanus. And not the least reason for not believing them is the fact that 
    they contradict one another. For some say even the Sidonians who are our neighbors 
    are colonists from the Sidonians out on Oceanus...but some hold that the Sidonians 
    out on Oceanus are colonists from our Phoenicia.&quot; </font>Strabo's Geography 
    I.2.35<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">A</font><font size="+1">nd agreeing, we say that these mysteries 
  found their way to Crete by way of ancient Britain (the island home of the earliest 
  Phoenicians, who were not only intricate to the creation of the Hebrew mysteries 
  to begin with [see 2 Chronicles, chapter 2], but which was also the original 
  Tyre of the Prophets...Ezekiel 26 to 28). And that they were carried there by 
  that merchant culture that had not only colonized the Mediterranean Sea, but 
  who--because of the great judgments, internecine warfare, and disbursals that 
  were befalling the inhabitants of Central Europe--somehow imagined themselves 
  to be the sole keepers of the Oracles of history (as modern day Britain and 
  America do today); thus creating in their wanderings in the literal sea (on 
  the Island of Crete) their own sense of the higher mysteries that were being 
  concealed directly above in the center of the figurative Sea, where the Great 
  Dragon lay hidden in the Center of Europe. Jill Purce, in her work entitled 
  <i>The Mystic Spiral</i>, says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The earliest known labyrinth 
    is that dating from the 19th century B.C. in Egypt; the most famous was in 
    Minoan Crete. These, and some of the earliest spiral rock engravings from 
    Paleolithic times, are reminders of man's increasing preoccupation with the 
    spiral order and his own spiral development.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the labyrinth creates and dissolves, 
    expands and contracts, so it reveals and conceals, It is cosmos to those who 
    know the way, and chaos to those who lose it. It is Ariadne's thread, whose 
    windings create the world and yet enables us to unravel it...</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I give unto you the end of the Golden String, Only wind it in a ball,</p>
    <p>It will lead you in at Heaven's Gate, Built in Jerusalem's Wall. <font size="2">William 
      Blake, Jerusalem</font>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point or centre, in those labyrinths 
    depicted in the pavement floors of many medieval cathedrals, is sometimes 
    a depiction of Theseus and the Minotaur. The symbolism is that of the original 
    Cretan --an initiatory hero test, the overcoming of death at the center, and 
    a subsequent return or rebirth into life. For, as it is necessary to be born 
    from the womb to see this world, only he who is born from himself sees the 
    other world. &quot;He who is not twice born will not ascend to the Kingdom 
    of Heaven.&quot; Other cathedral labyrinths depict the architect at the center, 
    sometimes symbolized in the person of Daedalus, the builder of the Cretan 
    maze. Since treading the maze was a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in miniature, 
    Daedalus also represents the Divine Architect. </font>The Mystic Spiral, p.29<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Since we are now going to 
    relate the final period of this famous city (Jerusalem) it seems proper to 
    give an account of its original. The tradition is, that the Jews ran away 
    from the Island of Crete, and settled themselves on the coast of Libya (Africa/Egypt) 
    and this at the time when Saturn was driven out of his kingdom by the power 
    of Jupiter (Zeus); and arguement for it is fetched from their name. The mountain 
    Ida is famous in Crete; and the neighboring inhabitants are named Idaei, which 
    with a barbarous argument, becomes the name of Judaei (Jews).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Others pretend their origin to 
    be more immanent, and that the Solymi, a people celebrated in Homer's poems 
    were the founders of this nation, and gave their own name Hierosolyma to the 
    city which they built there.&quot; </font>Tacitus, History of the Jews, Book 
    V.2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the Roman historian, Tacitus, has it correct--but greatly 
  confused--when he reports that the Jews originated from Crete, and that Judaea 
  lends its name to Mount Ida, a report which he does not believe. He cannot realize, 
  of course, that the story began in Central Europe, nor could he have realized 
  how the Jews (the Danaans) came up into this land in the first place, from Egypt, 
  or how they fell back out of it again centuries later...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mount Ida was not only a locality on the Island of Crete, it 
  is also a mountain in the range of the same name in Phrygia and Mysia in Asia 
  Minor. At the base of it was the Troad, whose capital was Troy. The mountain 
  described as &quot;Many Fountained&quot; (see John 4:9-14; 7:38), was the seat 
  of Zeus, and had a Grove of Trees sacred to him. It was from here, it is said, 
  that Zeus directed the Trojan War. What can the Iliad (and the Odyssey) be, 
  however, but another different attempt to interpret the Western World-mystery 
  by encompassing in poetic and mostly allegorical form the present and the future 
  in one epic narrative? It begins with the abduction of Helen (whom we have associated 
  with Europa). Who is she but Beauty (thus Wisdom), taken out of Europe, but 
  in this case to the East. A war ensues to get her back. It is still raging. 
  What could all of this be but the same events described in the Chronicles and 
  the Books of the Kings of Israel and Judah, when the mysteries of Israel departed 
  from Judah, leaving the City of David nearly forsaken and rejected? By this 
  time Israel is almost so inextricably entangled in the affairs of the nations 
  and peoples around it that we can no longer distinguish the Hebrew mysteries 
  from the Greek, or the children of Israel from the Trojans and Acheans--except, 
  as we have seen in the chapter devoted to Her, the children of Israel did not 
  depart alone...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mount Ida also had a seat upon it dedicated to the worship 
  of &quot;Cybele,&quot; the Idean Mother, or Mater Idea. She was the wife of 
  Chronus (Time) and mother of the Olympian gods. She was also called the Great 
  Mother. Paul leaves a clear allusion to his understanding of these things, and 
  to the fact that the world was divided between the higher and the lesser mysteries 
  in those times, when he speaks of the city of Jerusalem in Palestine and compares 
  it to the City Above which is in exile with Her children:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Which things are an allegory: for these are two covenants; 
    the one from mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Hagar.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth 
    to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the Mother 
    of us all...</font></i><font size="+1">(Galatians 4:24-26).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In other words, those who believe that that city in Palestine 
  is the Jerusalem of the Prophets (Isaiah 29), also believe that the Mount Sinai, 
  or Horeb, of Exodus, chapter 19, is also situated somewhere in that part of 
  the world between the land of Egypt and the land of Israel. Those who can see 
  how the City Above is situated in the center of the Oracle, in Europe, can also 
  realize how the words in Exodus 19 are being fulfilled in the events of the 
  20th century, and how the ability to see it does indeed separate the mind of 
  Egypt from the State of Mind (the Pure Land) promised to Israel in the fulness 
  of time. Those who can see it are set free from the events that are preparing 
  to fall now everywhere upon the Western world.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Iliad itself reveals how the original Mount IDA was situated 
  at a place deeper set than Asia Minor where it says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now when Morning, clad in 
    her robe of saffron, had begun to diffuse light over the earth Jove called 
    the gods in council on the topmost crest of serrated Olympus...If I see anyone 
    acting apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans, he shall be beaten inordinately 
    ere he come back again to Olympus. Or I will hurl him down into dark Tartarus 
    far under the deepest pit in the earth </font>(which means into the dark, 
    without understanding... Isaiah 24:15-21)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    where the gates are iron and the floors bronze, as far beneath Hades as heaven 
    is high above the earth, that you may learn how much mightier I am than you...</font></p>

    with hoofs of bronze and manes of glittering gold. He girded himself also 
    with gold </font>(the color of the Sun)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    about the body, seized his whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon 
    he lashed his horses and they flew nothing loth MIDWAY twixt earth and starry 
    heaven. After a while HE REACHED MANY FOUNTAINED IDA, mother of wild beasts, 
    and Gargarus, where are his grove and fragrant altar. There the father of 
    the gods and men stayed his horses, took them from the chariot, AND HID THEM 
    IN A THICK CLOUD </font>(see 2 Chronicles 1:14-17)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    and he took his seat all glorious upon the Topmost crests, looking down upon 
    the city of Troy and the ships of the Acheans.&quot; </font>The Iliad, Book

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Pseudo-Eupolemus' departure 
    from the biblical text to interpret 'Argarizim' as the Mountain of the Most 
    High makes sense if as a Samaritan he was trying to counter the claim that 
    the name Hierosolyma gave that city a special position as the site of the 
    famous temple. For the Samaritan shrine at Mt. Gerizim was not inferior since 
    its name denotes in Greek the Most High.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of primary significance for the 
    ancients, however, was the alleged allusions to Hierosolyma in Homer. The 
    Iliad records a certain people named Solymi who were said to be the enemies 
    of the Lycians. Speculations as to the identity of the Solymi gave rise to 
    many intriguing answers...Choerilus of Samos listed among the armies of Xerxes 
    that marched against Greece, the inhabitants of the Solymian hills, who he 
    said spoke a language related to Phoenician...Josephus following no doubt 
    a Hellenistic Jewish tradition, takes it for granted that Choerilus was alluding 
    to the fact that Homer referred to the Jews of Hierosolyma. This belief was 
    not limited to Jewish syncristic apologists. Lysimachus, an anti-Semitic writer 
    of Alexandria who flourished at the end of the first century B.C., was bothered 
    by the supposed link between Homer and Hierosolyma. He suggested that the 
    original name of Jerusalem was not Hierosolyma, but Hierosyla (a temple of 
    robbers). Nonetheless, the link between Homer and Hierosolyma was widely accepted 
    in antiquity, and is attested in Tacitus, a writer not specifically friendly 
    to the Jews.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Josephus argues, hierosolla does 
    not mean the same in the Jewish tongue as it does in the Greek. This irrefutable 
    argument loses its acuteness, however, by the fact that in his earlier works 
    Josephus used similar etymologies to glorify the name of the holy city. In 
    his first allusion to this issue, The Jewish War, V.438, records that after 
    Melchizedek, because he 'was the first who officiated as Priest of God and 
    the first to build a temple (hieron), the city previously called Solyma became 
    Hierosolyma.' In this passage Josephus does not explain the etymology of Solyma, 
    presumably because he took it for granted that the knowledgeable reader would 
    link it with the Homeric Solyma.&quot; </font>Ben Zion Wacholder, on Eupolemus<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The fact of the controversy itself, along with Homer's statement 
  that Neptune could see Ulysses from the mountains of the Solymi &quot;while 
  returning from the Ethiopians&quot;--which Josephus knows is a reference to 
  the Garden of Eden in the West--all serve to support our position of Jerusalem's 
  whereabouts in the North. And then the fact that the children of Israel, or 
  rather the central doctrines of Israel, have fallen back down out of Europe 
  into the East, and are embroiled in the (mostly allegorical) affairs of the 
  Trojan War, is supported by Strabo who puts the Solymi in Asia Minor. (The authors 
  of the Book of Acts will allude to this same location when they are referring 
  in their narratives to the lower Jerusalem):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And I think that since the 
    Solymi occupied the loftiest peaks of the Taurus Range, I mean the peaks about 
    Lycia as far as Pisidia, and since their country presented to people who lived 
    north of the Taurus Range, and particularly to those who lived about the Pontus, 
    the most conspicuous altitudes on the south--for this reason, on the strength 
    of a certain similarity of position, these people too were transferred to 
    the position out by Oceanus.&quot; </font>Strabo's Geography Book I.2.10<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Who were these European Jews? We do not want to tie them so 
  tightly to the Druid culture of the North so that we cannot distinguish the 
  important differences that existed between--the Druid cult of Caesar's time, 
  for instance, and the other classes of Jews that lived from one side of the 
  empire to the other. The differences were not unlike those that exist today 
  between the Orthodox of every Jewish and Christian persuasion on the one hand, 
  and the Liberal, Reformed, and Reconstructionist branches of Judaeo-Christianity 
  on the other. (Everything is happening again, just as it happened then). Caesar's 
  Druids are the result of 1,000 years of apostasy from the time the priest-kings 
  of D.V.D. ruled in Central Europe. And they are over 1,300 years removed from 
  the time Jethro, the arch-Druid ruled in MIDIAN (the MIDDLE region of the world). 
  And over 2,000 years removed from the time that the great Priestly archetype, 
  Melchizedek, ruled the thinking of the entire Hebrew universe. (See Hebrews 
  5 to 7). Nor do we want to disassociate them to the point that we cannot see 
  they were originally the same:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Such are the principle features 
    of the ancient Israelitish worship, and in every point they agree with the 
    Druidical. The same rites, the same ceremonies, the same feasts, the same 
    God, and in fine, the same religion. If the comparison were carried still 
    further, the identity would be even more striking...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not, however, in the more 
    modern times of Greece, when under the jurisdiction of the Roman governors, 
    that we are expected to find traces of Druidical or Israelitish worship, but 
    in the time of her Homers and Hesiods: then we discover the same religion 
    and the same rites were in use among the Greeks as among the Egyptians, Persians, 
    Arabians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Gauls, Estruscans, Hindus, Israelites, and 
    Druids.&quot; </font>Identity of the Religions Called Druidical and Hebrew, 
    London, 1829<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Jews of Europe were not strictly speaking comprised of 
  Celtic tribes (the original Canaanites), because the Celtic was a thoroughly 
  mixed up culture (and because then, as now, Judaism, or Israel, is not a bloodline, 
  or a distinct racial or cultural group, but rather a philosophy and a way of 
  life that has been adopted by peoples everywhere throughout the earth). Nevertheless, 
  among the tribes of Europe the Getae most reveal themselves to be &quot;Jews.&quot; 
  Their lives, however, were not being ordered according to the &quot;letter&quot; 
  of the Law, or history would have recognized them long ago, but according to 
  certain &quot;oral&quot; precepts, which caused them to more resemble pre-Christians 
  instead of Jews. Many of them were no doubt among those who returned to Eastern 
  and Central Europe in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, and were there when it 
  is said that Ezra opened the books...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And caused the people to understand the law...So they 
    read in the book of the Law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused 
    them to understand the reading...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then he said unto them, Go your way,</font></i><font size="+1"> 
    <i>EAT THE FAT</i>...</font>(a clear violation of the written Law...Ex.29:11-13; 
    Lev.7:22-25...proving that Ezra was instructing them in the liberating and 
    fulfilling measures of the Law, meanings that would be fulfilled later in 
    the mystery of Christ)<i><font size="+1">...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, 
    and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they understood the 
    words that were declared to them...</font></i><font size="+1">(Nehemiah 8:1, 
    5-12)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In fact it is surprising to read where Origen takes Celsus 
  to task on this point. Having a seemingly keen mind concerning the hidden structure 
  of the Scriptures (perhaps he could not perceive the hidden structure of history 
  as well) it seems he could have yielded in some subtle way. Perhaps he did and 
  it did not come through in the translation. Perhaps he is not merely saying 
  that Celsus does not understand, but that he &quot;really&quot; does not understand:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I must express my surprise 
    that Celsus should class the Odrysians, the Samothracians, and the Eleusinians, 
    and Hyperboreans among the most ancient and learned nations, and should not 
    deem the Jews worthy of a place among such, either for their learning or their 
    antiquity, although there are many treatises in circulation among the Egyptians, 
    the Phoenicians, and the Greeks which testify to their existence as an ancient 
    people, but which I have considered it unnecessary to quote. For anyone who 
    chooses may read what Flavius Josephus has recorded in his two books...where 
    he brings together a great collection of writers, who bear witness to the 
    antiquity of the Jewish people...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems then, to be not from a 
    love of the truth, but from a spirit of hatred, that Celsus makes these statements,

    with Judaism. Nay he styles the Galactophagi of Homer, the Druids of Gaul, 
    AND THE GETAE, most learned and ancient tribes, ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESEMBLANCE 
    BETWEEN THEIR TRADITIONS AND THE JEWS, although I do not know whether any 
    of their histories survive; but the Hebrews alone, as far as in him lies,

  importance here is that the Getae and the Jews share the same traditions. We

  were led away to Babylon by the marauding Scythians in the time of Jeremiah, 
  and that their priests were not only the same who opposed the early Church at 
  &quot;Jerusalem&quot; (Acts 7), but that they were among the same who inhabited 
  the whole world at that time, from Western Europe to the East:</font></p>

    MYSI who now live between the Lydians and the Phrygians and the Trojans. THESE

  <p>THE ISRAELITE NATIONS<br>
    COME TO EUROPE</p>
  <p>MAJOR MIGRATORY MOVEMENTS</p>
  <p> A brief summary of ethnic migrations pertinent to our study may help simplify 
    the overall picture&copy;:</p>
  <p>1. Movement by Sea<br>
  </p>
  <p>Most of the Israelites were exiled to the north. A portion however were transported 
    overseas in Phoenician and Philistine ships working for the Assyrians. The 
    transported Hebrews were taken to Spain, Gaul, and Britain. Proof for the 
    transportation of Israelites by Sea is obtainable from the Hebrew Bible, Biblical 
    commentaries, traditions, legends, archaeology, and historical writings. Those 
    taken to Spain moved northward into Gaul or crossed over to Britain and Ireland.</p>
  <p>2. Movement by Land Northward<br>
  </p>
  <p>Ca.740-720 BCE: The Assyrians moved masses of Northern Israelites (and other 
    Syrians and Phoenicians) to Northern Mesopotamia and to Hara in eastern Iran 
    where they became identified with Cimmerians, Scyths, and Goths.</p>
  <p>3. Cimmerians to Europe and Galatian-Gaul<br>
  </p>
  <p> Ca. 640 BCE: The first waves of Cimmerians via Turkey and the Anatolian 
    Bosporos were driven into the Europe whence they made their way west to Gaul 
    and Britain becoming identified as Celts and Galatians. The <br>
    Galatians were identifiable in Europe with both part of the Celts and Belgae 
    and with early groups in Germany. Even though the Cimmerian-descended Galatians 
    had migrated to Western Europe at an early date, Galatian expeditions back 
    from the west towards the east, resulted in Galatians being present also in 
    several eastern regions including parts of Scythia and the Galatian region 
    of Turkey. At the same time the Galatian center remained in Western Europe. 
    The Galatians were descended from Israelite Tribes (Reuben, half-Menasseh, 
    and Gad) that had once been located in the Land of Israel east of the Jordan 
    River. This area had been known as &quot;Gilead&quot; and &quot;Bashan&quot;. 
    The name of the Galatians was sometimes rendered as &quot;Galadi&quot; and 
    is derived from the Hebrew form of Gilead. Gilead is also the name of a son 
    of Machir from the Israelite Tribe of Menasseh whose descendants formed part 
    of the Galatians and related peoples.</p>
  <p> &uml; The Galatians had a tendency to merge with, or join in alliance to, 
    the Goths. The Goths came from Gad which Tribe had adjoined and confederated 
    with Machir from Menasseh in the Land of Israel.</p>
  <p>4. First Scythian Movements to Europe<br>
  </p>
  <p>Ca. 550 BCE: The movement of Scythians from the Middle East to north of the 
    Caucasus began in earnest with the penetration of Scythia. Offshoots from 
    this movement reached into Western Europe and Gaul but the only significant 
    presence established at this early stage was the one within the area of Poland 
    whence Scandinavia and the West were to be reached. Scythians west of the 
    Caspian Sea were dominated by the Royal Scythians. Those east of the Caspian 
    Sea became culturally differentiated from those to the west and so for convenience 
    sake are referred to as &quot;Sacae&quot; even though technically the term 
    &quot;Sacae&quot; could originally have referred to all Scythians.</p>
  <p>5. Royal Scythians Move Westward<br>
  </p>
  <p>Climate changes in Scythia caused &quot;Sarmatian&quot; groups to push the 
    Royal Scyths westward in the period 300-100 BCE. The Royal Scyths re-settled 
    at first in the area of Bulgaria, then after renewed pressure continued north, 
    ultimately to reach Scandinavia which was named &quot;Scatanavia&quot; (Land 
    of the Scyths) and &quot;Basilia&quot; (Pliny N.H. 27:35). The Royal Scythians 
    had been named &quot;Basiloi&quot;. This name came to mean &quot;monarchs&quot; 
    or &quot;royals&quot; in Greek but it was not originally a Greek word. The 
    area of Israel east of the Jordan known as &quot;Bashan&quot; had also been 
    called &quot;Basil&quot;.</p>
  <p>6. Royal Scythians To Scandinavia<br>
  </p>
  <p>The Huns emerging from Mongolia or further east from 200-160 BCE attacked 
    the Aseir (Wusun), Goths, and Sacae and caused these peoples to war amongst 
    themselves. These events were followed by a climate change which, after 120 
    BCE, caused the desolation of Chorasmia (east of the Caspian Sea) which previously 
    had been heavily populated. Goths and Sacae began to move westward and Scandinavia 
    was re-populated in the period 100 BCE 100 CE These movements caused a chain 
    reaction and immigrations into Scandinavia included Royal Scythians moving 
    northward from the Balkan area. The Baltic coast was also heavily settled 
    in this time, and from there more tribes were to move westward.</p>
  <p>7. The Belgae<br>
  </p>
  <p>After 200 BCE the Belgae from the East began occupying northern Gaul. They 
    were associated with, or accompanied by, a group ultimately hailing from the 
    Middle East and Syria and known linguistically as &quot;The Northwest Block.&quot;&copy;. 
    They arrived in Europe via Anatolia and the Crimean region of southwest Scythia. 
    Culturally these peoples were Galatian and Celtic. Groups of Belgae also occupied 
    parts of Britain and Ireland.</p>
  <p>8. Eastern Scythians Move West<br>
  </p>
  <p>Later, from eastern Scythia, in the decades 70-50 BCE, the Western Sienbi 
    and the Northern Hun group of Hugie, Dingling, and Gienkun moved westward. 
    The Northern Hun group in Scythia had encompassed several smaller tribes at 
    least some of whom were of Israelite origin. They began to re-appear from 
    50 BCE in the Rhine area of Western Europe and within a hundred years had 
    taken over the region. Archaeological evidence shows that in the time of Caesar 
    the area of &quot;Germany&quot; east of the Rhine had had a type of culture 
    (termed the &quot;La-Tene&quot; culture) similar to the Celtic type in northern 
    Gaul of the Belgae and Treveri. Within a hundred years (i.e. by 50 CE) this 
    culture had been completely destroyed and the region resettled by peoples 
    bearing previously unknown names such as the Chatti, Chasuarri, Angrivarri, 
    Ampsivarri, etc. The following examples of peoples who migrated from Scythia 
    to Europe have the name by which they were known in the west followed in brackets 
    by that which they had previously been called in Scythia: The Chauki (in Scythia 
    &quot;Cachage Scythae&quot;), the Tubantes (Tabiene), Bructeri (Bactria), 
    Chatti (Chatae Scythae), and the associated groups of Varni (Varini), Tigorini 
    (Taguri), Angiloi (Augali-Aegeli,), Jutes (Iatii), Sasons (Sasones) and Scoti, 
    Esci (Ascotacae), as well as Alans (Alans), Tectosaces (Tectosace Scythae), 
    As (Asi), and quite a few others listed in the following pages. The area of 
    Germany, like Scandinavia, received Tribes coming from Scythia and about to 
    continue westward into Gaul and Britain. [&quot;Gaul&quot; is a term generally 
    inclusive of modern France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Holland.].</p>
  <p>8. Suebi and Saxons Move Westward<br>
  </p>
  <p>From 150-350 CE continuous warfare instigated by the Huns in East Scythia 
    caused many more peoples to move westward amongst whom were the eastern branch 
    of Sienbi in ca. 170 CE [The western branch of Sienbi had previously gone 
    to Europe in about 60 BCE]. In Europe the Sienbi were generally referred to 
    as Suebi. This movement out of Scythia to the West caused the existing peoples 
    in Germany in the period 200-300 CE4 (and in some cases somewhat before that 
    time) to be replaced by bigger groups who absorbed them. The larger groups 
    included the Saxons, Franks, Alemani, and so on and the Suebi. The Suebi appear 
    to be the only major body remaining as an independent entity. They had acted 
    as precursors to the newer arrivals. They were to be closely associated with 
    the Saxons and Alamans who settled Alsace and Switzerland. Many of the peoples 
    arriving in the west came via Scandinavia or had had components in the Scandinavian 
    region. This explains why traditions attribute a Scandinavian origin to some 
    of these groups. The Scandinavians themselves believed that they came from 
    (or via) Scythia. The movements were of peoples coming from Scythia via Scandinavia 
    and the Baltic Coast, and in the south via the Balkans. These migrations could 
    be gradual. For instance, wooden chamber graves are noticeable in southern 
    Poland from before 200 BCE. These graves it has been suggested (by W.E. Filmer) 
    were modifications of former &quot;Royal-Scythian&quot; type and they are 
    connected with the movement of the Scythians to the north and west. After 
    100 BCE the same type of grave is evident on the north Baltic coast and a 
    hundred years later re-appears in Jutland (Denmark) where it continued for 
    several centuries. From Jutland emerged many of the invaders of England. The 
    movement westward could also be quite sudden. Events on the borders of China 
    or even deep within China sometimes had direct connection to movements in 
    the west. Peoples of nomadic disposition would traverse the distance. Chain 
    reactions of one group pushing forward another would also occur. It should 
    also be noted that by about 200 BCE several Scythian nations were already 
    dispersed with parts deep in Asia and other sections penetrating Europe. Suebi, 
    Goths, and Saxon groups were widely spread, as were others. Pockets of Alans6, 
    for instance, are discernible from the borders of China to the European Carpathians 
    and were eventually to be found in Brittany of Gaul on the Atlantic Coast.</p>
  <p>9. The Huns Push Saxons, Franks, and Others Westward In the years <br>
  </p>
  <p>350-450 CE the Huns moved en-masse out of &quot;Scythia&quot; (Eurasia) into 
    Europe forcing most of the peoples in Scythia to accompany them or else to 
    flee for their lives. As a result of the Hun invasions the Saxons, Franks, 
    and Alamans received a large augmentation of manpower with the addition of 
    new clans which (in the case of the Saxons) included those identified as Huns 
    proper. In response to Hun pressure these greatly increased bodies overran 
    the Western Roman Empire and settled Gaul and Britain. Goths, Vandals, Visigoths, 
    and others also conquered formerly Roman countries. In most cases however, 
    the conquerors were numerically insignificant when compared to the native 
    populations. The whole process of movement, on the whole, was to continue 
    till about 500 CE with an invasion by the &quot;Vikings&quot; some time later. 
    In this period the white peoples of the East, described by the Chinese, were 
    to disappear almost entirely and re-appear in Europe. Examination of events 
    in the east enhances understanding of the &quot;Great Migrations&quot; period. 
    It also adds an additional confirmatory dimension to the body of evidence 
    connecting the migrating peoples and their modern &quot;European&quot; descendants 
    with The Lost Tribes of Israel.</p>
  <p>10. The Danites and Nephtalites Move to Scandinavia<br>
  </p>
  <p>In the very far east of Scythia in what is now eastern Siberia and western 
    China a good portion of the Naphtalite horde had remained. In the 450-500 
    CE period the Naphtalites began to move west eventually entering Scandinavia 
    in the 500's and 600's CE. The Naphtalite horde included the Danes who re-settled 
    Denmark possibly via Sweden. The Naphtalites themselves settled mainly in 
    Norway. Sweden was populated by Goths and by Suiones descendants of Shuni 
    (pronounceable as &quot;Su-oni&quot;) son of Gad (Genesis 46;16).</p>
  <p>11. The Viking Invasions<br>
  </p>
  <p>The continued migrations to Scandinavia resulted in over-population, the 
    pushing outwards of coastal populations, and subsequent overseas colonization. 
    The Scandinavians overseas were known as the Vikings.</p>
  <p>12. The Normans<br>
  </p>
  <p>The Vikings settled in England, Ireland, Normandy (France), and elsewhere. 
    In Normandy the Vikings accepted French Culture and were called Normans. From 
    Normandy they invaded England in 1066.</p>
  <p>13. The Getae and Daci<br>
  </p>
  <p>A portion of the Cimmerian-host in its trip westward had remained in the 
    Balkans and became known as the Getae and Dacii. The Getae were a Gothic people 
    who had been culturally influenced by the neighboring Thracians. The Getae 
    and Dacae had an aversion to images, certain similarities to the Celtic druids, 
    and were Monotheists as well as <br>
    believing in an after-life. Most of the Getae and Daci in the period 100 BCE-100 
    CE moved to the north toward the Baltic and Scandinavia and eventually participated 
    in the Anglo-Saxon invasions of Britain. The Roman Imperialists exterminated 
    those who remained behind in &quot;Dacia&quot; of the Balkans. The Getae had 
    been linked with the Agathyrsi from whom emerged the Khazars and Picts.</p>
  <p>14. The Picts and Khazars<br>
  </p>
  <p>Some groups of Sacae-related Israelites including bands of Goths and Naphtali 
    remained in the Caucasus region and adjoining areas of Scythia. These were 
    eventually to amalgamate with the Agathyrsi and form the KHAZAR nation which 
    converted to Judaism. Some of their descendants are to be found today amongst 
    the modern Jews. The real core of the Khazar nation federation was centered 
    on the Akatziri or &quot;Agathyrsy&quot; as the Greeks called them. The Agathyrsi 
    had had at one stage a section on the Baltic coast and another in Pontus by 
    the Caucasus. At some time between 50 BCE-300 CE (more likely closer to the 
    latter date) the Agathyrsi sent a contingent across the sea to Scotland where 
    it became identified with the PICTS (Servius on Aenid 4.v.146). The Picts 
    were to act more as accomplices than as opponents to the Anglo-Saxon invasion. 
    The Picts were formidable warriors and seriously perturbed all who stood against 
    them. The Agathyrsi-Picts intermixed with peoples in Scotland who had been 
    there before them and are therefore mistakenly identified with them. The Agathyrsi 
    (Akatziri) in Europe were described by Jordanes (the Gothic historian) as 
    being an extremely brave people. The Khazars, who came from the Agathyrsi, 
    were to convert to Judaism and had their own belief in having once been part 
    of the Israelite <br>
    nation. </p>
  <p>The Khazars were centered in Southern Russia but a small colony also existed 
    in Sweden. The Khazars in Sweden had connections to the Anglo-Saxon colony 
    of Hedeby in North Germany before the Angles and Saxons moved to Britain12. 
    The Khazars and the Goths in early Medieval times were identified by Medieval 
    Chroniclers with the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. Similarly, the Historian Gildas 
    in Britain (500s CE) appears to have identified the Celtic inhabitants of 
    Britain as Israelites. The Anglo-Saxon Bede identified the English physically 
    with the people of Israel. The Franks and Visigoths in the 7th century had 
    similar notions13. Historically many of the peoples who came westward were 
    considered Gothic though the Goths-proper settled in Sweden. There exist traditions 
    placing Israelite Tribes in areas of Sacae and Gothic habitation and their 
    Tribal names correspond with those of Israelite entities. The parallelism 
    between the Scyths and Israel has also been shown. The Scyths, Goths, Cimmerians 
    and related groups of Scythia were all one people, from one original stock, 
    which was Israelite. From these nations emerged those of Western Europe. The 
    &quot;Barbarian&quot; nations who invaded Northwest Europe derived from forces 
    of the Scyths and Goths, who in turn had once been together with the Cimmerians. 
    The Cimmerians had previously gone west and become part of the &quot;Celtic&quot; 
    peoples whom the &quot;Barbarians&quot; were now conquering. The above list 
    traces all the invaders of West Europe back to the Cimmerians, Goths, and 
    Scythian Sacae. The Scythian origin of the &quot;Barbarian&quot; invaders 
    of northwest Europe strengthens the case for the nations in question having 
    significantly large Hebraic elements in their ancestral stock.</p>
  <p>SCANDINAVIA<br>
  </p>
  <p>Scandinavia was destined to serve as a place of settlement for many of the 
    Scythian peoples and as an area of transit for others on their way west. A 
    clarification of Scandinavia's history facilitates the explanation of Scandinavia's 
    role. Several distinct periods are observable:&uml; </p>
  <p>1. The Bronze Age, which ended about 500 BCE and culminated with the almost-complete 
    depopulation of Scandinavia. The founders of this civilization had come from 
    the Middle East, from Israel, and in part moved to Ireland and Britain. They 
    are recorded in Irish tradition as the People of Dana.<br>
  </p>
  <p>2. The era between 100 BCE and 100 CE in which Scandinavia was re-populated, 
    especially by Royal Scyths and Goths.<br>
  </p>
  <p>3. A century of disturbance (300's- 400's CE) in which Scandinavia was apparently 
    conquered and in which many Tribes left and headed further west.<br>
  </p>
  <p>4. The arrival of new peoples from east Scythia in the 500's and 600's CE 
    culminated in the 700's experiencing overpopulation and unsettlement which 
    led to the Viking oversea expeditions.&uml; Later arrivals in Scandinavia 
    provide plentiful evidence of having arrived from the &quot;Sacae&quot; areas 
    in east Scythia. This evidence consists of legends, art, customs, archaeological 
    findings, and demographic factors.</p>
  <p>EVIDENCE OF SCYTHIAN ORIGINS<br>
  </p>
  <p> It may be shown that the &quot;Barbarian&quot; newcomers emerged from Scythia 
    from several viewpoints: Demographically, Germany at that time could not have 
    supported the millions of people in the Barbarian forces. The archaeological 
    and historical evidence indicates that most of Germany was relatively unpopulated, 
    uncultivated, and not amenable to large groups of settled (non-nomadic) peoples. 
    The same applied for the rest of northern Europe. In east Scythia there had 
    existed settlements of numerous civilized peoples of so-called &quot;Nordic&quot; 
    appearance who disappeared shortly before the Barbarians were first recorded 
    in Western Europe The &quot;Barbarians&quot; who suddenly appeared in Western 
    Europe had traditions that they came from Scythia and their artistic styles 
    are actually identical to those known from the Scythian areas. They had similar 
    &quot;Shamanistic&quot; Scythian religious beliefs and customs, they wore 
    the same armour, and fought with the same tactics. The Scythian peoples were 
    destined to disappear from Scythia in the period between 300 BCE to ca. 600 
    CE. Just as the Scythians were leaving Scythia, they began to appear in the 
    west as &quot;Barbarians&quot; largely after passing through Scandinavia, 
    Pannonia (Hungary), and Germany. The similarities between the Scythians and 
    the &quot;Barbarians&quot; who invaded the West are acknowledged and discussed 
    by modern scholars. They however tend to assume that the &quot;Barbarians&quot; 
    came from Scandinavia and Germany and simply absorbed &quot;Scythian&quot; 
    influences through a process of cultural osmosis and also that some Scythian 
    or Sarmatian bodies had been confederated into the essentially &quot;European&quot; 
    Barbarian hosts. </p>
  <p>In 700 BCE Germany had beenpractically uninhabited. Later, a few isolated 
    peoples did settle in Germany but these are archaeologically and linguistically 
    indistinguishable from their Celtic, Thracian, or Illyrian neighbours20. Scandinavia 
    at one stage had supported a rich and advanced Bronze Age civilization which, 
    due to invasions and climatic change, virtually disappeared leaving the region 
    almost deserted until about 100 BCE21 when it was repopulated as described 
    by peoples emerging from Scythia. Neither Scandinavia nor Germany of that 
    time could have supported the masses of peoples who came to the west after 
    ca.200 BCE Neither are there any intermediate stages of significance, which 
    show any cultural osmosis from Scythia taking place. The Barbarian nations 
    (such as the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, Danes, Vandals, Goths, Alemans, Alans, 
    Vikings, etc.) already possessed their &quot;Scythian&quot; characteristics 
    when they first appeared. The Romans who encountered the &quot;Barbarians&quot; 
    on their borders, fought against them whilst at the same time enlisting them 
    in their armies, and wrote about them, had essentially correct information 
    concerning their origins. They considered the Goths to be Scyths and the Scyths 
    of Scythia to have become, under different names, the Barbarian nations22 
    of the west who were pushing against the Roman frontiers which they often 
    reached via Germany.</p>
  <p>Scandinavian and German archaeological findings show that in the period of 
    the Great Migrations described above especially that after 400 CE groups of 
    settlers and military elites from the Scythian area were to be found in Scandinavia 
    and throughout those areas of Germany23 that gave to the hosts participating 
    in the Anglo-Saxon invasions of Britain.</p>
  <p>It is now generally agreed that the Barbarians did not originally speak an 
    Indo-European language though at some stage they came to learn one &quot;badly&quot; 
    in a linguistic sense. In Germany, they conquered and/or adjoined Indo European 
    &quot;natives&quot; with whom they forbade intermarriage24 though they interacted 
    linguistically and culturally. After the Scythian Barbarians left &quot;Germany&quot;, 
    going to France, Holland, Britain, Switzerland, and elsewhere, the native 
    &quot;Germans&quot; re-asserted themselves. Meanwhile hordes of Slavonic and 
    other peoples swept into Germany in the 500's CE to fill the vacuum left by 
    the evacuating Scythian Israelites. These peoples were &quot;Germanized&quot; 
    through colonies of German natives settling amongst them, pressures by German 
    Rulers, and the policies of the Catholic Church. The process of Germanizing 
    the Slavonic peoples in Germany, including those of Bavaria, continued into 
    the twentieth century. The invaders of Britain after 400 CE were headed by 
    the Angles, Jutes, and Saxons. Parallelisms exist between Anglo-Saxon culture 
    and that of Scythia. Recent archaeological and related reappraisals of the 
    invaders of Britain in the period of Anglo-Saxon invasions reveal very little 
    connections with German culture which has led some modern authorities to begin 
    to doubt that they even came from Germany&copy;! The correct solution, seems 
    to be that they emerged mainly from Scythia and passed through Scandinavia 
    and/or Germany without sojourning for an appreciable time. It is doubtful 
    if they had serious contact with the &quot;native&quot; peoples before their 
    continuing on into Britain.</p>
  <p>Language<br>
  </p>
  <p>The Scythian-Gothic nations had emerged from Scythia. In east Scythia, -at 
    least in the area east of the Caspian Sea whence the Sacae (Anglo-Saxons) 
    were once centered, Aramaic was spoken. Aramaic is closely related to Hebrew. 
    Some of the Israelite Tribes had spoken Aramaic while others used a type of 
    Hebrew influenced by Aramaic, or Aramaic influenced by Hebrew. Aramaic was 
    one of the official languages of the Assyrian Empire. The Old Anglo-Saxon 
    English language is a composite dialect and contains many Hebrew words. Linguistically, 
    the west Barbarians may originally have spoken Hebrew or a related Semitic 
    dialect. There is nothing to obviate such a possibility since new languages 
    were sometimes learnt and old ones forgotten in historical experience. The 
    Normans, for instance, came from Scandinavia and settled en-masse in Normandy, 
    France, but within two generations they had forgotten their parent language 
    and knew only French! Terry Marvin BLODGETT in 1981 published a Ph.D. Thesis 
    (&quot;Phonological Similarities in Germanic and Hebrew&quot;, The University 
    of Utah, 1981) in which he proved that the original tongue of the northern 
    &quot;Barbarians&quot; was Hebrew. Blodgett, now Professor of Languages, Southern 
    Utah University, Cedar City, Utah, USA, showed how it is agreed that approximately 
    one-third of all Germanic vocabulary is of an unknown (non-Indo-European) 
    origin. &quot;Also the Germanic sound shifts and gemination are not to be 
    explained on the basis of Indo-European linguistics&quot;. These foreign non-Indo-European 
    elements can be attributed (says Blodgett) to Hebrew incursions recognizable 
    in the areas of phonology, morphology, and lexicology. &quot;English, Frisian, 
    Dutch, Flemish, High and Low German, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic, 
    as well as the extinct languages of Gothic, Old Norse, Old Saxon, and others 
    comprise one of the Indo-European groups of language commonly called Germanic. 
    On a broader scale, the Germanic branch of languages shares many features 
    in common with the Italic, Greek, Celtic, Slavonic, Indo-Iranian and other 
    Indo-European groups&quot;. Even so, the Germanic branch of these languages 
    has a non-&quot;Indo-European&quot; component comprising approximately one-third 
    of the total: It is this element that Blodgett identified as HEBREW!!! Blodgett 
    proved his case using terminology and a great many examples of a technical 
    nature. A crude but reliable enough explanation of the overall tendency of 
    Blodgett's work is as follows:</p>
  <p> At some early stage, there occurred a series of sound shifts in the Germanic 
    language or languages, the Indo European &quot;bhrator&quot; became &quot;brother&quot;, 
    &quot;peter&quot; became &quot;father&quot;, etc., e.g. &quot;p&quot; became 
    pronounced as &quot;f&quot;, &quot;t&quot; became &quot;th&quot;, &quot;k&quot; 
    became &quot;ch&quot;, b, d, and g also changed. Opinions concerning the date 
    of this Germanic Sound Shift give dates varying from 2000 BCE to 9 CE. On 
    the one side, John T. Waterman (&quot;A History of the German Language&quot;, 
    1966) says &quot;the general consensus of scholars is that the Germanic Sound 
    Shift began probably not much before the fifth century B.C., and that it was 
    essentially completed by the last pre-Christian century&quot;, i.e. from ca. 
    400 BCE to 100 BCE. Waterman bases his case on the fact that words in Germanic 
    borrowed from Greek in the 400s BCE also underwent the shift whereas words 
    taken from Latin in the first century BCE did not. On the other hand, Heinz 
    F. Wendt (&quot;Sprachen&quot;, 1977) believed that the shift had been essentially 
    completed by 500 B.C. Overall it seems to be accepted that the shift occurred 
    around 500 BCE give or take a century or two. All Germanic dialects took part 
    in the shift so it is assumed that the change took place whilst the parent 
    groups were still in the north, - in Scandinavia and Northern Germany. The 
    period of 500 BCE (for the said &quot;Sound Change&quot;) is the one most 
    authoritative opinion seems to converge on. Whether it occurred before 500 
    BCE or in the following era the most important point for us is recognition 
    of the fact that it did occur. A lot of reasons have been proposed to explain 
    this shift but the bottom line is that the Cause is generally ascribed to 
    ethnic factors implying racial mixture. &quot;S. Feist thinks that the northern 
    peoples were originally non-Indo-European, who learnt their Indo-European 
    from the broad-headed Alpine race.&quot; Waterman and others basically held 
    similar opinions. It is the northern areas of Scandinavia and Germany at that 
    time that were linguistically less Indo-European. We have shown above that 
    in the period under consideration newcomers from Scythia were in the area 
    and that In East Scythia Aramaic was used as the major language. The Scythians 
    in East Scythia must have used Hebrew as well as Aramaic. New works by Scandinavian 
    scholars such as Dr. Kjell Aartun and Orjan Svensson (of Blekinge in Sweden) 
    have proven that the first Runic inscriptions in Scandinavia were written 
    in dialects derived from Hebrew and Aramaic!! Early Nordic dialects as well 
    as early English ones still retained a large number of Hebrew and Aramaic 
    words and Hebrew characteristics. Remnants of these are still to be found 
    in the English language.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The Germanic Sound Shift can best be explained by the mass presence of former 
    Hebrew-speakers. The same changes that occurred in Germanic occur in Hebrew 
    according to fixed Grammatical and phonetic rules. Blodgett points out that 
    people who from birth made the said changes would naturally have tended to 
    speak as if the changes also held in a foreign language that they may have 
    been forced to use at short notice. Even sophisticated technical details concerning 
    rules of the Sound Shift in Hebrew were continued into Germanic. Additional 
    linguistic evidence confirms the presence of Hebrew speakers amongst the early 
    Northern Peoples. &quot;The Origin of Modern Culture Languages and their Derivation 
    from the Hebraica,&quot; by Professor Karl Rodosi, 1891, also adequately proves 
    that the so-called Germanic tongues must have been formed by peoples who originally 
    spoke Hebrew. The implications of these studies are applicable to West Europeans 
    but do not encompass most of the modern Germans. The case is similar to that 
    of the present inhabitants of Jamaica who now speak English though only a 
    portion of their ancestors came from Britain. An idea of the affinity between 
    English and Hebrew may be also obtained from Isaac Mozeson, &quot;The Word,&quot; 
    NY, 1989. Mozeson says (p.1), Hebrew vocabulary has as much affinity with 
    English as it has with Arabic. More English words can be clearly linked to 
    Biblical Hebrew than to Latin, Greek, or French&uml;.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Thus, the Israelites became the Cimmerians, Scyths, and Goths, and these 
    became the Barbarian invaders of Western Europe. Other proofs exist confirming 
    these conclusions. This evidence includes the retention of Israelite Tribal 
    and Clan names by the migrating bodies. It also involves the continued, or 
    renewed, employment of traditional Israelite Tribal symbols by modern nations 
    amongst whom there exists a definite presence of that very same tribe to whom 
    the traditional symbol belongs. In nearly every case the National symbols 
    correspond with the Israelite Tribal emblem of whatever Tribe became dominant 
    within the nation concerned! Nations in whom a specific Israelite Tribe settled 
    developed national characteristics that derived from the tribe.</p>

    in North America, Britain, and of British origin. This is what the Bible says 
    in accordance with the original Hebrew text and Rabbinical explanations.<br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The Bible says that in the Last days the Lost Ten Tribes will be at situated 
    at the ends of Continents. They compared to a bald-headed eagle (symbol of 
    the USA) and by a lion and unicorn which are the symbols of Britain. They 
    were to be in Isles of the Sea, in the best parts of the earth, mainly to 
    the north and west of the Land of Israel but also in Australia and similar 
    regions. They were to be associated with the Atlantic Ocean, to be seafarers, 
    the mightiest, most powerful, and richest nations in the world. They were 
    to be a civilizing influence in the world, and extremely numerous. They were 
    also to be largely unaware of their Israelite identity and to practice a non-Jewish 
    religion. Judah at first would not <br>

  <p><b>ZEBULON</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;And the sons of Zebulon; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel&quot; (Genesis 
    46;14). Some Main Points: We identify Zebulon as primarily the people of Holland. 
    In general Israelites settled in that area: A people named Sebulingoi were 
    recorded as being there and this name means &quot;People of Zebulon&quot; 
    and other names confirm that. It was prophesied that Zebulon would dwell on 
    the shores of the sea: <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>One third of Holland is below sea-level and another third would be subject 
    to periodic flooding by the sea if it was not for protection by the dykes. 
    Most of the country is therefore on the seashores and it is the only country 
    in the world about which this can be said. The symbol of Zebulon was a ship 
    and this was the traditional symbol of Holland. for more points read on:</b></p>
  <p><b> Moses (Deuteronomy 33;18) grouped the two brothers Issachar and Zebulon 
    together, saying, &quot;Rejoice, Zebulun in thy going out; and Issachar in 
    thy tents&quot;. From this verse it was understood that Issachar and Zebulon 
    had a symbiotic relationship, Issachar being involved in Religious and scientific 
    intellectual pursuits and Zebulon setting forth in ships to trade and, with 
    his earnings, contributing to the support of Issachar. Other Rabbinical opinions 
    say that it merely implies that Issachar was more inclined towards working 
    the land and less given to venture out. Groups of Zebulonite origin are often 
    found in association <br>
    with groups from Issachar. Zebulon is identifiable with Holland. </b></p>
  <p><b>The people of Alsace and Lorraine (in France) come from both Issachar 
    and Zebulon and their region forms a bridge from Switzerland to Belgium and 
    Holland. The symbol of Holland was a ship in popular tradition and a ship 
    was the symbol of the former Dutch Republic. Many of the Boer (Afrikaans) 
    population of the Republic of South Africa are of Dutch descent. A ship was 
    also the symbol of Zebulon. Zebulon, in Talmudic Literature, was pictured 
    as a merchant seafarer, which description fits the Dutch. Rotterdam in Holland 
    is the world's busiest port. Moses blessed Zebulon (Deuteronomy 33; 19): that 
    he should &quot;Suck of the abundance of the seas and of treasures hid in 
    the sands&quot;. </b></p>
  <p><b>Today both South Africa and Holland are on the seashores and a good portion 
    of the earlier diamond wealth of South Africa was found in the &quot;sands&quot;. 
    Another important element in the population of both Holland and South Africa 
    is a portion of Naphtali of whom it was said, (Deuteronomy 33; 23): &quot;Possess 
    thou the west and the south&quot;; - being the west of England (settled by 
    Vikings from Norway) as well as both Holland and Norway. The South meant both 
    South Africa and New Zealand. South Africa was settled by British and Dutch, 
    and New Zealand by British of a particular type. Shillem, son of Naphtali, 
    has been traced by archaeological similarities (supported by linguistics) 
    to the Vandals of Silesia [Germany-Poland] (Silingi-Silem, -Silen) and to 
    Vendsyssel of Jutland (Denmark) in the first century b.c.e. Previous to that 
    time, the cultural contacts of Vendsyssel were more to Zeeland in southern 
    Holland. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The Huns of Nephtali (in addition to settling in Norway) re-appeared as 
    recognizable groups among the Frisians who invaded England. The Frisians of 
    Holland in their character fit Zebulon though to some degree they are also 
    traceable to Menasseh (Peres) and Judah (Peretz) and the Nephtalite element 
    amongst them may have been important in early South African colonization. 
    Similarly, Zebulon, though dominant in Holland, is also represented by &quot;Halland&quot; 
    of the southwest coast of Sweden, and by Hallin in Norway which names come 
    from that of Elon, son of Zebulon, as does the name for Holland itself.</b></p>
  <p><b>Only The Dutch dwell &quot;on the shores of the Sea&quot; since the Dutch 
    descend from Zebulon!! Jacob prophesied (Genesis 49;13): &quot;Zebulon shall 
    dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his 
    border shall be unto Zidon&quot;. Zidon, at one stage, was conquered by the 
    Sakkara who were named after the Tribe of Issachar but whose forces in this 
    case probably comprised or at least included Zebulonites [1]. A Prophecies 
    concerning the tribes were applicable both within the Land of Israel and outside 
    of it. In both cases, some degree of literal significance is to be expected. 
    The expression concerning Zebulon, &quot;His border unto Zidon&quot; could 
    be fulfilled in a number of ways [2]. In the verse,</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Zebulon shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for 
    an haven of ships... &quot; (Genesis 49; 13): The expression, &quot;dwell 
    at the haven of the sea&quot; according to the HEBREW original (Hof-yamim) 
    may be preferably translated as &quot;dwell on the SHORES of the Sea&quot;. 
    The only nation in the world whose population is known for dwelling extensively 
    on reclaimed sea-land, literally, &quot;On the shores of the sea&quot;, is 
    Holland. The SABALINGOI went to Holland and their name means &quot;People 
    of -ZEBULON&quot;!!! Zebulon through the Alans and Alamans of Elon, son of 
    Zebulon, merged with the Suebi from Jashub (pronounceable as Ja-sueb, Num. 
    26;24) of Issachar in Alsace and in Switzerland i.e. they bordered &quot;Sidon&quot;, 
    as Switzerland was referred to. </b></p>
  <p><b>In early Scythian times the name Zebulon was recalled in ZABULISTAN which 
    was to the south and south-east of Hara in the Iranian area. The name of ZEBULON 
    is also found in the Sabalingoi recalled by Ptolemy in south Jutland and northern 
    Frisia in Holland. The name SABALINGOI in Hebrew means &quot;People (Goi) 
    - of - ZEBULON&quot; since in Northern dialects &quot;Sabalin&quot; and Zebulon 
    would have been alternate pronunciations of the same name: The &quot;Z&quot; 
    was replaced by &quot;S&quot;; and &quot;goi&quot; means people in Hebrew. 
    The Sabalingoi were to the north of the Sigulones (whose name in Hebrew means 
    &quot;Chosen Ones&quot;) and of the Saxons and in turn, to the north of the 
    Sabalingoi were the Chali sons of Jahleel [Yachlayl in Hebrew, and the Ya 
    would have been dropped] (Genesis 46; 14). Sered was a son of Zebulon as was 
    Jahleel and also Elon. The Suardinoi (from Sered) were identified (by Kaspar 
    Zeuss , &quot;Die Deutschen und Die Nachbarstamme,&quot; Germany 1835) as 
    inhabitants of Holland. From Jutland and Scandinavia there were several waves 
    of migration into the area of nearby Holland especially into Frisia so the 
    Sabalingoi and Chali moved to the Netherlands' region. Ptolemy may in fact 
    be interpreted as placing the Sabalingoi in northern Frisia and thus in Holland 
    . </b></p>
  <p><b>Pytheas (ca. 325 b.c.e.) is reported as describing Holland as peopled 
    by Skuthai (i.e. Scythians) meaning (probably) Frisians who, in the 300's 
    and 200's b.c.e., are claimed to have begun absorbing the native Celts. There 
    followed several centuries in which the population fluctuated greatly. In 
    about 200 c.e. the Franks invaded. Angles, Saxons, and JUTES from Jutland 
    overran the land in 450-500 c.e. Consequently, Frisians, together with others, 
    participated in the Anglo-Saxon invasions. After ca.600 c.e. Frankish influence 
    re-asserted itself. Roughly speaking, modern Holland has Frisians in the north, 
    Saxons in the east, and Franks in the south. It also has important continents 
    of French Huguenots, Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews, Malays, and Eurasians 
    of mixed blood. In other words, the population is of mixed origins like the 
    populations of most countries. This does not contradict the fact that a good 
    proportion of the people (if not most) are descended from Israel or that amongst 
    the Israelites a certain tribe has the ascendancy. Enough has been shown to 
    prove that often groups of divergent backgrounds converging on one spot, are 
    revealed as having originally the same tribal identity.<br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The Dutch speak Germanic dialects but Professor Theo Vennemann of Munich 
    and his school have shown that underlying these dialects in Holland there 
    may be discerned a linguistic substratum similar to that found amongst the 
    Insular Celts of Britain and ireland and which is Semitic in origin.</b></p>
  <p><b> The FRISIANS are a people now concentrated in Northern Holland but once 
    spread all along the coast from Scandinavia through Holland, Belgium, and 
    into France. The Angles and Saxons before they, together with other northern 
    peoples, invaded Britain in the 450s c.e. had sojourned (at least in part) 
    for about 200 years in Holland especially in Frisia. Some of the Jutes had 
    also been in Frisia. The Byzantine historian, Procopius (Gothic War vii; 20) 
    said that the Frisians were an important element amongst the invaders of Britain.</b></p>
  <p><b> The name of the Frisians is traceable to Peres son of Gilead of Menasseh 
    but the actual inhabitants of present-day Frisia and Holland are identifiable 
    on the whole more with Zebulon. In Biblical times, Tribes such as Zebulon, 
    Issachar, and Asher were closely associated with Menasseh and it would seem 
    that this linkage was repeated after their exile in areas of their re-settlement. 
    At all events the identity of the Frisians must be closely linked with that 
    of peoples who invaded and settled the British Isles.</b></p>
  <p><b>In the land east of the Caspian archaeologists have found the ruins of 
    an extensive civilization whose inhabitants spoke Aramaic. Some of the Israelite 
    Tribes had spoken Aramaic even before their exile and the language was used 
    as an official tongue in the Assyrian Empire and is believed to have been 
    the most commonly-used one. Phillip Lozinski (1953) believed that from this 
    region east of the Caspian came the &quot;Barbarian&quot; peoples whom he 
    suggests may have been at least partly Semitic. They invaded Europe beginning 
    from around the 200s c.e. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(They 
    invaded Central Europe in the time of Jeremiah the prophet)</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    </font>Additional evidence exists showing that the invaders must have come 
    from Scythia and the region east of the Caspian. These invasions and migratory 
    movements were often connected with activities of the Huns who themselves 
    were a mixture of various peoples. The Huns from this vicinity caused other 
    nations to flee westward. N.C. Lukman (Copenhagen, 1943) showed how in Nordic 
    Mythology the name Adel (meaning &quot;Noble&quot;) was often used as a euphemism 
    for Attila the Hun and for the Huns in general. In the Frisian legends King 
    Adel was the father of Friso, Bruno, and Saxo. Scientific Linguists have concluded 
    that the Northern &quot;Barbarians&quot; who entered Europe had the later 
    European aspects of their languages imposed upon them by an external force. 
    They originally spoke both Hebrew and Aramaic.</b></p>
  <p><b> The legends speak of these three brothers being descended from Shem and 
    having been in Jerusalem at the time of its destruction by the Babylonians: 
    &quot;In the time of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnessar (586 B.C.), 
    3 brothers - Friso, Bruno, and Saxo with [their] wives, children, and relatives 
    fled out of the country, encouraged to do so by announcements of the Prophets 
    concerning the fall of the town&quot;. In this legend Bruno represents the 
    Angles who according to Ptolemy had at one stage been centered on the region 
    of Brunswick in eastern Germany. They had also had a center in Angeln to the 
    south of Denmark or else they moved to Angeln prior to the invasion of England. 
    By placing Friso, Bruno, and Saxo in Jerusalem (which became representative 
    of all Israel) before its capture the legend in effect infers that the Frisians, 
    Saxons, and Brunswickian-Angles were therefore originally Israelites or Jews. 
    </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(As we said, Davidiy does not 
    see the whole picture yet)</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></b></p>
  <p><b> F. Koeslag points out that &quot;In legends...events of several eras 
    may be concentrated around famous historical figures - as you see with Charlemagne&quot;. 
    The legend may therefore be taken as reflecting a tradition that the three 
    brothers were related to the Jews which is consistent with their belonging 
    to the Lost Ten Tribes who had been exiled from their own lands in Israel 
    at least 140 years before the actual fall of Jerusalem. The legend contains 
    the recognition that the three brothers had left the Land of Israel (identified 
    as &quot;Jerusalem&quot; or the Land of the Jews) before Nebuchadnessar of 
    Babylon captured it. The northern Israelites had indeed been exiled prior 
    to the Babylonian onslaught. The Lost Ten Tribes had been re-settled in Assyria 
    and in lands ruled by Assyria. </b></p>
  <p><b>Another Frisian legend says that Albione and 32 sisters went from Assyria 
    by ship and landed in England which they called Albion. After they landed, 
    Brutus drove them out of the country and re-named it Britain in his own honour. 
    The Albioni crossed the Sea and landed in Frisia. This legend may also serve 
    as an indicator of Israelite origins since the exiled Israelites had indeed 
    been re-settled in &quot;Assyria&quot; (or in Assyrian-controlled areas) before 
    asserting their independence and moving elsewhere. </b></p>
  <p><b> The legends relate how while still in &quot;India&quot; Friso married 
    Hilla daughter of Agathocles king of Thrace. They were driven out of &quot;India&quot; 
    and sailed to Greece where Friso became a student of Plato (427-374 b.c.e) 
    and then joined the Army of Alexander the Great. Alexander from Macedonia 
    and Greece advanced into Asia Minor (modern Turkey) and from there continued 
    into Persia, Bactria, the area east of the Caspian Sea and northwest India. 
    In the east Alexander reformed his army and took into his Special Forces mainly 
    peoples belonging to the Sacae-Scythian Tribes. From the Sacae descend the 
    Anglo-Saxons and company. Le Petit also says that the brothers served under 
    Alexander. A strong early tradition existed in Europe that the Saxons had 
    been soldiers in Alexander's armies. This tradition was mentioned in the time 
    of Charlemagne King of the Franks (768-814 c.e.). </b></p>
  <p><b>Additional traditions and evidence connect the Anglo-Saxons with the ancient 
    Sacae-Scythians some of whom really had been in Alexander's forces. The legends 
    state that via Asia Minor the people of Friso, Bruno, and Saxo came on a very 
    large ship called &quot;di Mannigfuald&quot; (i.e. &quot;The Multitude&quot;) 
    to the west. Friso in 313 b.c.e. landed in Friesland (i.e. in Frisia) and 
    founded a settlement called &quot;Stavoren&quot;[6]A Bruno and Saxo (brothers 
    of Frisso) went eastward though Saxo (according to Le Petit) then returned 
    to the west. Bruno founded the city of Brunswick in which area of Germany 
    Ptolemy placed the Angloi thus identifying them with the people of Bruno. 
    The Angloi (Angles) also moved northward to the regions bordering Denmark 
    and from there they went to Britain some of them sojourning (like the Saxons) 
    in Frisia on the way.</b></p>
  <p><b>[1]A Even so Issachar was also linkeable with Sidon: The Tribe of Issachar 
    were destined to dominate Switzerland and a people named SEDUNI once dwelt 
    in Celtic Switzerland (ca. Sion) which, together with all Switzerland in medieval 
    times, was named &quot;Sidon&quot;.</b></p>
  <p><b>[2]G. &quot;Sidon&quot; (i.e. Zidon) could be represented in any one of 
    a number of ways. There were the people of &quot;Sidone&quot;, scattered groups 
    of whom seem to have usually accompanied Vandals from the Tribe of Asher which 
    tribe had encompassed the original Phoenician City of Sidon. Switzerland was 
    called &quot;SIDON&quot; in medieval times. The coast of northern Gaul (France 
    and Belgium) had been partly settled by groups of Phoenician culture and possibly 
    SIDONIANS were amongst them since Sidon and Tyre were the major Phoenician 
    cities also all Phoenecians were called &quot;SIDONIANS&quot;.</b></p>

<p><font size="+1">So we want to look deeper into these historical narratives, 
  and especially into the writings of Josephus (and the Gospels). They are a blend 
  of History and initiation. To see inside of these accounts the initiate must 
  pay close attention to the &quot;tenor&quot; of the narratives, to the catch-words 
  and phrases, studying them for their double usage, or for their epic application. 
  For instance, when Josephus is describing the wars that ensued after the death 
  of Alexander, between his successors the Antiochans and the Ptolemies (Antiquities 
  XI and onwards), dividing Israel and Judah between them, we immediately visualize 
  events confined to that land that lies between Syria and Egypt. But a great 
  part of these wars were fought in Europe. Antiochus Soter (Savior) did not only 
  engage the Gauls but so did his successors advance into Europe on other occasions--to 
  engage the forces of Egypt who, under their several Ptolemies, and who, &quot;with 
  their 15,000 ships,&quot; controlled not only Greece but the whole region around 
  Thrace and Macedonia. It was not only from Palestine that Jews were removed 
  into Egypt but from Europe as well. Josephus does not come right out and say 
  it because as we said before he is both revealing and concealing these things 
  at the same time...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the same way he allows his accounts of the Maccabees to 
  slip right out of Europe to the East via Samothrace (or <a href="../../UsedImages/dragon.gif">Samaria</a> 
  as the prophets knew the entire region) without raising a hint. Which is why 
  he is always saying tch, tch! to the other historians of his time. They simply 
  did not know how to record sacred history. Which, of course, is also why other 
  historians are always taking Josephus to task for not always having his facts 
  straight. When Josephus calls the Hasmonean, Alexander, &quot;a Thracian among 
  the Jews&quot; (Antiquities XIII.IV.2), Whiston does not realize that Josephus 
  really means it. Whiston says: &quot;This name Thracida which the Jews gave 
  to Alexander must denote 'as barbarous as a Thracian, or somewhat like it.'&quot; 
  He cannot realize that Josephus has followed the course of these events, along 
  with the movements of the Celto-Thracian-Jewish tribes themselves, as they moved 
  through all of these upheavals out of Europe into Asia-Minor, and subsequently 
  into Palestine. The entire East was speaking Greek, and it was all in motion.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Likewise, we must see that Josephus has already made the connection 
  between Jerusalem and Hierosolyma, the City Above. So he is free now everywhere 
  in his narratives (as were the authors of the Books of the Maccabees and the 
  Book of Acts) to refer to Jerusalem in its local sense; or in its regional sense--meaning 
  that wherever the people are, and wherever the precepts of the Torah are being 
  observed--there the City is. But also in its epic and universal sense as he 
  does when he describes the judgment which fell upon this City--which did not 
  only occur in those days at the hands of the Romans, but again in Europe in 
  the events of the 20th century, and as it is about to in America to end the 
  age itself. (Ezekiel 33):</font></p>

    lament the destruction of such a work as this was, since it was the most admirable 
    of all the works which we have seen or heard of, both FOR ITS CURIOUS STRUCTURE 
    and ITS MAGNITUDE, and also for the vast wealth bestowed upon it, as well 
    as for the glorious reputation it had for holiness; yet might such a one comfort 
    himself with this thought, that it was fate that decreed it to be so, which 
    is inevitable, both as to living creatures and as to works and places also...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A false prophet was the occasion 
    of these people's destruction, who had made a public proclamation in the city 
    that very day, that God commanded them to get up upon the temple, and that 
    there they should receive a miraculous sign of their deliverance. Now there 
    was a great number of these false prophets suborned by the tyrants to impose 
    upon the people </font>(as there are today)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    who denounced this to them, that they should wait for deliverance from God; 
    AND THIS WAS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM DESERTING </font>(see Ex.1:10)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    and that they might be buoyed up above fear and care for such hopes. </font>(See 
    Ezekiel 13)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Now a man that is in 
    adversity does easily comply with such promises; for when such a seducer makes 
    him believe that he shall be delivered from those miseries which oppress him, 
    then it is that the patient is full of hopes of such a deliverance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus were the miserable people 
    persuaded by these deceivers, and such as belied God Himself; WHILE THEY DID 
    NOT ATTEND, NOR GIVE CREDIT TO THE SIGNS THAT WERE SO EVIDENT, AND DID SO 
    PLAINLY TELL THEIR FUTURE DESOLATION. But like men infatuated, without either 
    eyes to see or minds to consider, did not regard the denunciation that God 
    made to them. Thus THERE WAS A STAR RESEMBLING A SWORD </font>(Haley's Comet)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    which stood over the city, and a comet that continued a whole year. Thus also, 
    before the Jews rebelled, and before these commotions which preceded the war,

    This light seemed to be a good sign to the unskillful, but was so interpreted 
    by the sacred scribes as to portend those events that followed immediately 
    upon it. At the same time a Heifer, as she was led by the High Priest to be 
    sacrificed, BROUGHT FORTH A LAMB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TEMPLE.</font></p>

  to Rome. He meets &quot;certain priests,&quot; and has arrived at, of all places, 
  Putoli. (Acts 28:13; Life 3). Among his other hints he says: &quot;I was now 
  about the 30th year of my life.&quot; (Life 14, 15). This is the figurative 
  time of Christian initiation. (See Luke 3:21-23). He uses the term &quot;Galileens&quot;

  of this tomb in 1952 had found it constructed within a Roman building, with

  Heylegenstatt (Place Where the Holy One Has Been Laid) and has a twelfth century

  Josephus was initiated) is stretched out across the Great Sea, from the East 
  as far as the Western ends of the Earth, so the writers of the Gospels employed 
  similar literary tactics when they applied to the Proctorship of Pontus Pilate 
  such things that must come to pass again in the West. G.R.S. Mead, in his <i>Did 
  Jesus live 100 B.C.</i> (p.423), says: &quot;The name Pontus Pilate came most 
  readily to hand in this connection in those days of name-play, for it bare close 
  resemblance to a mystical term which played an important part in the mystery 
  teachings.&quot; And then he mentions a colleague, C. W. Leadbeater, who also 
  associates the name with the &quot;sea-ward mysteries&quot; and the &quot;descent 
  of the soul into the underworld.&quot; The underworld is a euphemism for the 
  West, or the regions below the Navel of the Earth. In other words, just as Paul 
  said that they erred who said that <i>the Resurrection is past already</i> (2 
  Timothy 2:18), so the Crucifixion is not complete yet either. Christ is still 
  dying in every human death, and is still coming to life in every human birth

    &quot;the Pontus&quot; just as they spoke of Homer as &quot;the Poet.&quot; 
    Perhaps it was for that reason that Homer transferred to Oceanus things that 
    were true of the Pontus.&quot; </font>(or to the Pontus things that were true

<p><font size="+1">The Roman empire did not only extend from Palestine and Egypt 
  to Britain in those times, but northward to the Danube and that city, Vindebona, 
  as it was then known. It was a city thoroughly reduced and rejected (just as 
  it has been thoroughly tread under the feet of the Gentiles since that time--of 
  emperors and Popes, and Crusaders on their way to the &quot;holy land.&quot; 
  Perhaps the report of its importance and centrality to the life of Israel then, 
  was something like trying to convince Christians and Jews today that Salt Lake 
  City is the true center of Zion, and that the members of the Latter Day Church 
  of Jesus Christ are the true priests of Israel. No, I guess it was more like 
  trying to convince Christians and Jews today that Vienna, and the region thereabouts, 
  is the true center of Zion, and that it always has been. The world was in no 
  less a state of apostasy and confusion then as it is today. (Those who understood 
  it, and the reason it was being concealed from the world at large, became the 
  fathers and mothers of the early Church).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Those who call themselves Jews today are by and large indignant 
  at the way the term (<i>the Jews</i>) is used in the New Testament to describe 
  such apostates, and even to describe those who &quot;persecuted Christ.&quot; 
  And this indignation flows from a general belief, not merely that they are the 
  only true Jews but that they have always been, and that the Gospels must necessarily 
  be referring to them. Normative Judaism as we know it today springs from that 
  small group (or groups) of Jews who were set aside by God out of all other groups 
  of Jews that existed in the time of Christ. They were set aside--despite their 
  refusal, as well as inability to understand these matters (their zealous refusal 
  to see the Torah spiritualized out of existence, or to see it perverted as they 
  perceived it to be by the larger Jewish world that surrounded them, by the Greeks, 
  the Hasmoneans and the Saducees and the Zealots). And what of these Essenes? 
  We are already seeing how the lines of communication were opened between the 
  Essenes and these Pharisees, and how the one sect was secretly informing the 
  other. Realize that the Talmud, and therefore almost all of Judaism since the 
  time of Christ's, knows nothing of the events being described in the Gospels. 
  &quot;When did we do this?&quot; &quot;How did it happen?&quot; &quot;When did 
  it happen?&quot; &quot;Where did it happen?&quot; Finding itself accused of 
  it centuries later, after the Christian story of initiation began to circulate, 
  Judaism had to reach back into its own archives and come up with the Jeschu 
  stories to make sense of it, or to rationalize it to themselves, and (at their 
  own peril at times) to others. What we have in the Christian narratives is a 
  classic case of &quot;If the Shoes fits wear it.&quot; For just as the Gospels 
  imply a Universal Israel, and a Cosmic Christ (who is killed every day by Jews, 
  Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, agnostics, humanists...and all others 
  who partake in the rituals of warfare and execution), so are they also referring 
  to the Universal Jew, of which the whole world was filled in those times. There 
  were Jews in Egypt and Africa, Jews in the East, Jews in Europe, in Rome, in 
  Athens, in Britain, in India, in America, Jews everywhere. The Gospels are referring 
  to all--no matter how distant, or how obscurely--who made a claim to the God 
  of Israel, or even in the least wise to the doctrines and the teachings of Israel...which 
  are in turn partly comprised of the doctrines of all the other world-religions 
  combined.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And then this indignation flows from the fact that as the emerging 
  World-church (which had not grasped the hidden message of the Gospels either), 
  came to power, it began to harass and then eventually persecute those who still 
  called themselves Jews (just as it did, however, to the true Christians and 
  all those others over the centuries that it could not distinguish from each 
  other, other than the collective fact that they would not adhere to the teachings 
  and the authority of the now powerful and imperial World-church). As this World-church 
  began to encourage its followers (the mindless masses), to consider these Jews 
  &quot;Christ-killers&quot; it could not see--in its own loftiest sense of its 
  own Christian self--that it had become the &quot;Jews&quot; who were persecuting 
  and killing Christ.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Likewise the religious world today is divided, as the world 
  was then, into three basic levels of attachment to the affairs of the world. 
  We understand it in the words: <i>Take heed and beware of the leaven of the 
  Pharisees and Saducees </i>(Matthew 16:6-12), and in our understanding now of 
  that third class in Israel, the Essenes. This latter class is associated with 
  the Qumran library which assists us in all of our present conclusions. Certain 
  members of this class, among whom John the Baptist appeared at that time, also 
  gave us the Gospels which, along with the works of Josephus, help us in our 
  definition of the differences that existed between these three classes:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Saducees are the worldly and 
    the &quot;purely ethical.&quot; They are the temple elite. They are aligned 
    with and friendly with the powers of the age. They associate their fate, here 
    in the West, with the fate of Politic-America. They believe in no culminating 
    events in history, no Messiah, no Resurrection, and stay busy elevating the 
    souls of men into the status-quo. They are religious, unspiritual, and generally 
    affluent, exploiting not only the religious sentiments of the higher echelons 
    of society, but along with them the great bounty that God has provided for 
    the benefit of all. The Saducees of old were scattered (into other forms of 
    Jewishness), or perished, when God sent the Romans down to destroy that city 
    and that temple made with hands. In terms of the Mystical Body they are the 
    &quot;flesh,&quot; or that which is enslaved to serve the spirit. They are 
    in bondage and cannot enter the kingdom of heaven (James 4 and 5).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pharisees: these live in two 
    worlds. They know there is a mystery, an oral tradition, a world above and 
    a world below. They war in the spirit against the world below, but when expedient 
    they will forsake the higher for the lower. They will, if it serves their 
    interests, kill for things &quot;below,&quot; even sacrificing their sons 
    and daughters to the <i>Consuming Fire</i>. (Deuteronomy 4:1-39; Hebrews 12:12-29). 
    This because they fight two wars, and carry two swords. They know there is 
    a mystery, but they do not know it; an oral tradition, but they do not know 
    its precepts. Yet they know in part. They are above and below. They know there 
    is a resurrection, and they study and prepare for it, but they stumble over 
    its meanings. They cling to the &quot;letter&quot; and oppose the Spirit. 
    They are divided in affection between the Saducees and the Essenes. (Let us 
    not forget, of course, that the founder of Christianity was from this sect).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Essenes are the remnant in 
    every generation. They go by many names and no names at all. They live closest 
    to God, and the Holy Spirit is at home in their hearts. They are free from 
    the trammels of their age because they bind themselves to the inner meanings 
    of God's laws. They do not kill, nor do they search the scriptures for permission 
    to do so, knowing how these interpretations are reserved for the children 
    of Darkness. They are found among the other two classes, but mostly they are 
    found where their sentiments are, laboring in various ways for and among the 
    poor, the oppressed, and the infirm. They are found in communities of like-minded 
    individuals, or in no communities at all. Some are still found living alone 
    in contemplation, overcoming not only the collective transgressions of their 
    age but the private transgressions of their own hearts. They live by the Eightfold 
    Precepts and by the Sermon on the Mount.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Many are standing at the door, but it is the solitary 
    who will enter the bridal chamber...</font></i><font size="+1">(The Gospel 
    of Thomas, 75).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">While the worldly &quot;ascend&quot; to bring the souls of 
  men downwards, these &quot;descend&quot; to raise them back up. They are ready 
  to assist God at the turn of every age. When God parts the times asunder the 
  Essenes proceed, the Saducees perish, and the Pharisees are drawn between them.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the city of Vindebona, of Celtic character, and Roman, 
  and Greek, and Hebrew (as Vienna was, and as New York City is today), was probably 
  not too much disturbed when that first group of Essenes appeared in her gates, 
  having come up from the East to observe a Solar Festival as almost all of Europe 
  was given to in those times. Miranda Green, in her <i>The Sun Gods of Ancient 
  Europe</i>, says: &quot;The Celtic Sun God was worshipped over a wide area. 
  The deity was present in virtually every region of Celtic-occupied Europe.&quot; 
  (p.89). Their's was a Festival of Weeks, or Pentecost. It was a pre-enactment 
  of the great events that would come to pass at the end of the age (Acts 2). 
  It was also a time of Counting the Omer, or the days since Passover. It was 
  also a time to begin to count the years, and the Jubilees of years, that would 
  begin to unfold until the end of the age. (Leviticus 23:10-16; Lev. 25:8-17). 
  Count 49 days from those events that began to transpire in the East, until those 
  Essenes arrived at the gates of Jerusalem in the North. And then count 40 periods 
  of 49 years from those times to the events that are unfolding here in the 20th 
  century. (Deuteronomy 8):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Counting the Omer...Climb 
    the 49 steps up from Mitzrayim (Egypt) to the heights of Sinai. </font>(Read 
    Exodus 19)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seven weeks of seven days, day 
    by day, week by week, the community watches the spring grain grow--watches 
    with hope and anxiety. Day by Day, week by week, the community moves forward 
    from the moment of freedom's first explosion--moves forward with hope and 
    anxiety. Will the earth succeed in unfolding its fruitfulness? Will we succeed 
    in finding rest and new truth in our freedom?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Day by day, week by week, the community 
    counts the days of growing grain--and through them counts the unfolding of 
    the earth and of our own potential. Day by day, week by week; for this is 
    no holy day, not even a week-long festival--but truly a season of the year. 
    A season full of hope, and full of anxiety.&quot; </font>Seasons of Our Joy,
