      <p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;'Egypt is the 
        image of the skies,' writes Lucie Lamie, 'where the divine beings sail 
        'the waters on high,'' and so the Nile has a heavenly as well as earthly 
        source…Its periodic rise and fall are associated with the myth of Osiris, 
        divine principle of perpetual return, death and rebirth, as symbolized 
        by the annual cycle of vegetation… In Roman times the Nile was itself 
        called 'the Year.' As one scholar notes, 'This conception not only reflects 
        the rather precise annual recurrence of the flood, but also sought to 
        relate it to the magical powers of Time." Seeing that the Egyptians saw 
        the Nile as "the exact counterpart of heaven" and "the year incarnate,' 
        it is only appropriate that the Nile, spelled as it was in ancient Greek, 
        totals 365, the number of days in the year…&quot;</font></p>

        thou speak of statues, Thrice Majestic? Yes, of statues, Asclepios…of 
        what else shall I speak but of the statues, so full of life, of feeling, 
        the prophetic statues which predict the future by bestowing dreams and 
        bt all manner of other ways…Are thou not aware O Asclepios, THAT EGYPT 
        IS THE IMAGE OF HEAVEN, OR RATHER THAT IT IS THE PROJECTION BELOW OF THE 
        ORDER OF THINGS ABOVE?</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">If 
        the truth must be known, this land is indeed the Temple of the world. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Nevertheless, 
        since sages ought to forsee all things, there is one thing thou must know: 
        a time will come when it will seem that the Egyptians have adored the 
        gods so piously in vain, and that all their holy invocations have been 
        barren and unheeded. Divinity will quit the earth and return to heaven, 
        forsaking Egypt, its ancient abode. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Then 
        this earth, hallowed by so many shrines and temples, will be filled with 
        sepulchres and with the dead. O Egypt! There will remain of thy religion 
        only vague legends which posterity will refuse to believe…But yet sadder 
        things will come to pass. Egypt will fall into apostasy, the worst of 
        all evils. Egypt, once the holy land beloved of the gods and full of devotion 
        will become an instrument of perversion, the school of impiety, the type 
        of all violence. Then filled with disgust for everything, a man will no 
        longer feel either admiration or love for the world. He will turn away 
        from the beautiful work, the most perfect alike in the present, the past, 
        and the future. Nor will the langour and weariness of souls permit anything 
        to remain save the disdain for the whole universe, this immutable work 
        of God, this glorious and perfect ediface, this manifold synthesis of 
        forms and images, wherein the will of the Lord has united all things in 
        a harmonious and single whole, worthy forever of veneration, of praise 
        and love. Then darkness will be preferred before light, and death will 
        be deemed better than life, nor will men lift up their eyes to heaven. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In those 
        days religious men will be thought mad; the impious men will be hailed 
        as sages; savage men will be deemed valient, and the evil-hearted will 
        be applauded as the best of men… </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">And 
        thus God is above the summit of heaven, yet everywhere present and beholding 
        all things. For beyond the heavens is a sphere without stars, transcending 
        all corporate things…And to those whom it will be given to dominate the 
        earth shall be sent forth and established AT THE EXTREMITY OF EGYPT, IN 
        A CITY BUILT TOWARD THE WEST, whither by sea and by land, shall flow all 
        the race of mortals.&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
