  <p><font size="+2">HAWTHORNE AND GOODMAN BROWN</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">One must know the mystic path through these 
    woods, I fear, to know full well where Goodman Brown went wrong and lost his 
    <i>Faith</i>. It is a perilous journey indeed, one that he shouldn't have 
    taken, at least not that night, or at least not in those times. &quot;Stay 
    home with me this night,&quot; Faith implored--innocent Faith, happy, joyous 
    Faith with her <i>pink </i> ribbons. No stiff and rigid companion was this 
    wife. He should have stayed and grew old with her...but then again, something 
    more compelling was waiting there on the edge of the wood that night, something 
    that leads the seeker from simple Faith to deeper Understanding, and others--Hawthorne 
    would have Goodman and all his co-religionists know--had gone there and were 
    the better for it (what, with his own travels away from home and his newfound 
    company of gnostics and romanticists, all of whom had found the joy of uncertainty 
    and what for them were the simpler pleasures of <i>true</i> religion). &quot;Four 
    went into paradise&quot; the ancient warning told, &quot;but only one went 
    in and came out in peace.&quot; As fate (call it pre-determination or pre-destination) 
    itself would have it (and what havoc it is still imposing on the Calvanist 
    frame of mind), Goodman Brown went in and lost his way. &quot;May you find 
    all well when you come back,&quot; Faith called out. He could not sense the 
    tone of her voice. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Goodman Brown made haste &quot;on his present 
    evil course.&quot; Poor double-minded man, he was without Faith now--the faith 
    that assures one that every path one takes in life will lead to Life again. 
    &quot;What if the devil himself be at my elbow?&quot; Well of course the devil 
    himself will be at one's elbow, for the devil is one's own self, itself. What 
    else went he into the wood to find? What other path is there to self-realization, 
    to Christ-consciousness if you will, but to the very center of the deep, dark 
    forest where grows and thrives the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil? 
    &quot;Trust the Force..&quot; (Wait, this is another story, another time. 
    Too bad. Had Goodman Brown followed the path of Anakim Skywalker--Darth Vadar--he 
    might have understood. Or had he descended into the depth of his own mystic 
    soul with Gandalf in the <i>Two Towers</i> he might have entered that dark 
    wood in a wholly other state of mind). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">&quot;You are late,&quot; said he, that figure 
    of a man in <i>grave</i> attire, seated at the foot of an <i>old tree</i>. 
    &quot;Faith <i>held me back</i> Goodman replied. A leery, suspicious mind 
    was his companion now, even as he encountered the only (repressed) part of 
    himself that was capable of showing him the way--that part that bore &quot;a 
    considerable resemblance to himself, though perhaps more in expression than 
    features. Still they might have been taken for <i>father and son</i>.&quot; 
    Hawthorne presages Freud here, but not the holy scripture that said: <i>Unless 
    a man shall hate his father</i>...meaning, of course, his very own natural 
    mind, his old self, but not his own God-driven natural impulses, from which 
    one's own spiritual potential emerges and grows. (The Puritan mind was confined 
    inside the borders of its own <i>Holy Commonwealth</i>, where literalism reigned 
    and paradox was foreign). &quot;Come, Goodman Brown,&quot; cried his fellow 
    traveler, &quot;this is a dull pace for the beginning of a journey. <i>Take 
    my staff</i>, if you are so soon weary<i>. </i>What staff was this, that bore 
    the likeness of a great black snake? It was <i>Wisdom's Staff</i>,<i> </i>one 
    of the very rods which its owner had formerly lent to the Egyptian magi, one 
    that they could not master either. For God had commanded the true seer to 
    return and grab that serpent by the tail. Fear not evil, the Spirit told him, 
    take hold of it and turn it to discipline. Turn it back into the shepherd's 
    staff, the same that Goodman's guide, the true shepherd of the soul, had offered 
    him to lean upon. &quot;Let us walk on, <i>let us</i> <i>reason as we go</i>.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">&quot;Too far! too far!&quot; the goodman unconsciously 
    exclaimed. &quot;My father never went into the woods on such an errand, nor 
    his father before him.&quot; (Not that they hadn't passed this way, and often, 
    but that they had never come this way in search of light). &quot;Indeed,&quot; 
    said his spirit guide, and &quot;well said...For I have been very well acquainted 
    with your family, as if ever a one among the Puritans, and that's no trifle 
    to say. I helped your grandfather, the constable, when he lashed the Quaker 
    woman through the streets of Salem; and it was I that brought your father 
    a pitch-pine knot, kindled at my own hearth, to set fire to an Indian village, 
    in King Phillip's War. They were my good friends, both; and many a pleasant 
    walk have we had along this path...Many a deacon, in fact, has drunk the communion 
    wine with me. Governors and great men are my supporters...(ah) &quot;but these 
    are state secrets.&quot; I would fain be friends with you for (all) their 
    sake.&quot; As he spake he pointed his staff at a female figure on the path, 
    &quot;in whom Goodman Brown recognized a <i>very pious and exemplary</i> <i>dame 
    </i>(old Goody Cloyse, <i>Goody Cloister</i> that is)<i>, who had taught him 
    his catechism in youth, and was still his moral and spiritual advisor.</i>&quot; 
    Goodman reasoned to himself, with a hint of suspicion now: &quot;A marvel, 
    truly, that Goody Cloyse (of all people) should be so far in the wilderness 
    at nightfall.&quot;...The traveler put forth his staff and touched her withered 
    neck with what seemed like the serpent's tail. &quot;The devil!&quot; screamed 
    the pious old lady...&quot;That old woman taught me my catechism,&quot; said 
    the young man; and &quot;there was a world of meaning in this simple comment,&quot; 
    said Hawthorne. But the young man couldn't get it...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">And </font><font size="+1"> it is here, not 
    later, that Goodman Brown fails in his quest for understanding, no less self-perfection. 
    One would think that it was at the <i>witche's coven</i> in the middle of 
    the wood (a typical Sunday service he discovered to his own dismay), where 
    the <i>righteous</i> Puritans and <i>pious</i> people, the elders, <i>chaste 
    </i>dames and <i>virgins</i> all came secretly in their own hearts to congregate...</font></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="left">Of the two, reverend sir, said a voice like the deacon's. I 
    had rather miss an ordination dinner than to-night's meeting....Mighty well, 
    Deacon Gookin!&quot; replied the solemn old tones of the minister. Spur up, 
    or we shall be late...Wither, then, (Goodman Brown wondered, half seeing now) 
    could these holy men be journeying so deep into the heathen wilderness? &quot;Bring 
    forth the converts&quot; called the minister, the one who looked strangely 
    like his own father.&quot;<font size="+1"> </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...when young Goodman Brown had to catch hold of a tree for 
  support with a heavy sickness in his heart, when his eyes were opened (or at 
  least it seemed to him; as he reasoned now, with condemnation in his own heart, 
  <i> </i>that<i> they</i> are all of them frauds and hypocrites); or when he 
  purposed in his own mind to to seek perfection now with out them (&quot;With 
  heaven above and Faith below, I will yet stand firm against the devil!&quot;); 
  or even when the cry of grief, rage, and terror pierced the night, when the 
  unhappy husband also realized that Faith herself was gone. &quot;My Faith is 
  gone!&quot; No, it wasn't then, but rather when he set out without her in the 
  first place, and when he, lacking faith, refused to go another step further 
  with the only one who could have brought him safely into the wood and out again, 
  that part of himself that was capable: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;They continued to walk onward, while the elder traveler exhorted his 
    companion to make good speed <i>and perservere in the path...</i>Until suddenly, 
    in a gloomy hollow on the road, Goodman Brown sat himself down on a stump 
    of a tree <i>and refused to go any further...</i>Friend, said he stubbornly,<i> 
    my mind is made up. Not another step will I budge on this errand.</i> What 
    if a wretched old woman do choose to go to the devil when I thought she was 
    going to heaven? Is that any reason I should quit my dear faith and go after 
    her?&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;'You (or those after you) will think better of this by and by,' said 
    his acquaintance, composedly, 'Sit here, rest yourself for awhile, and when 
    you feel like moving again, there is my staff to help you along.'&quot; (It 
    was not the shepherd's staff that he left him though, but a dried and withered 
    maple stick from that very wood where Goodman sat). &quot;Without more words 
    he was speedily out of sight as if he had vanished in the deepening gloom. 
    The young man sat a few moments...applauding himself greatly, and thinking 
    with a clear conscience how he should meet the minister in his morning walk, 
    nor shrink from the eye of Deacon Gookin. And what calm sleep would be his 
    that very night, which was to have been spent so wickedly, but so purely and 
    sweetly now in the arms of Faith.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">&quot;Had Goodman Brown fallen asleep in the forest, and only 
  dreamed a wild dream of a witch meeting?...'Be it so if you will; but alas! 
  it was a dream of evil omen for Goodman Brown. A stern and sad, a darkly meditative, 
  a distrustful, if not a desperate man did he become from the night of that fearful 
  dream. On the Sabbath day, when the congregation were singing a holy psalm, 
  he could not listen because <i>an anthem</i> of sin rushed loudly upon his ear 
  and drowned out all the blessed strain. When the minister spoke from the pulpit 
  with power and fervid eloquence (as the ministers of Ba'al are wont to do anyway), 
  and with his hand on an open bible, of the sacred truths of our religion, and 
  of saint-like lives and triumphant deaths...then did Goodman Brown turn pale, 
  lest the roof should thunder down upon the grey blasphemer and his hearers. 
  Often, awakening suddenly at midnight, he shrank from the bosom of Faith; and 
  at morning or eventide, when the family knelt down to prayer, he scowled and 
  muttered to himself, and gazed sternly at his wife, and turned away. And when 
  he had lived long, and was born to his grave a hoary corpse, followed by Faith, 
  an <i>aged</i> woman, and children and grandchildren...they carved no hopeful 
  verse upon his tombstone, for his dying hour was gloom.&quot;</font></p>
