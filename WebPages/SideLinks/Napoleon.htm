  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Various explanations have 
    been given for the popularity of Napoleon and the persistence of his legend 
    in the United States...His ideas, words, and even actions unconnected with 
    wars were of no interest; what mattered were feats of battle, arms, and military 
    glory. The cult of Napoleon was part of another cult, the cult of chivalry...Napoleon 
    symbolized the romantic warrior.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When they set him up as a 
    warrior belonging to all times and places, their vision was the same as Napoleon's...&quot;

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Brotherhood for Napoleon 
    was not simply a union of the men of his time in the same political order; 
    it was a solidarity of all men throughout history. HE HIMSELF WAS A LINK IN 
    A CHAIN THAT ATTACHED A DYING CIVILIZATION TO ONE IN THE PROCESS OF BIRTH. 
    HE INSERTED HIMSELF INTO HISTORY; His dream's movement was meant to be synchronized 
    with the movement of history.&quot; p.213. </font></p>

    Lost, the author says):<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 'America 
    gave birth to a nation, but one that was born fully developed like Adam...' 
    It was the Paradise Lost that men hoped to rediscover, evoking the simplicity 
    of a new-born world untroubled by the complexities of intertwined civilizations...Although 
    the Western myth lives on in America...there is in America a state of pre-civilization.&quot;

    men roles in the great design known to it alone, a design that had no moral 
    element. He himself was one of these godlike men, like Alexander the Great

    the danger of a political power so strong as to infringe upon democratic freedoms, 
    chief among them was the freedom to make money.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The so-called Constitution of the 
    Year XII (1804) removed from France the last vestiges of legislative independence, 
    but it maintained the fiction that the nation, though ruled by an emperor, 
    was a republic. This fiction was soon allowed to fall into oblivion. The Tribunate, 
    deprived of what usefulness it still had, continued to vegetate for three 
    years and then died a quiet death. The emperor's will became law either by 
    the promulgation of decrees or in the form of <i>senatus consulta</i>. In 
    the latter case the emperor would send the text of the proposed law to the 
    Senate for its approval; the Senate would pass it unanimously, without change, 
    and thank the emperor for his gracious communication in abjectly servile terms 
    reminiscent of senatorial practice under Tiberius and Nero...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While it was clear to the emperor 
    that a generation that had passed through the French Revolution and witnessed 
    his climb to power could never, in its innermost heart, accept him as monarch 
    by divine right, he expected to bring up the future generations in that faith. 
    The school system, as reorganized by him in 1807 and 1808, placed all education, 
    on all levels, under the central authority of the University of France--that 
    is, of the state.&quot;...Education was not restored to the Church, but religion 
    nevertheless became one of its basic features, and the cornerstone of religion 
    was the catechism Napoloeon had drawn up for France...Here is what all French 
    children were taught under Napoleon's reign: <i>Question: </i>What should 
    one think of those who fail in their duties to our emperor? <i>Answer: </i>According 
    to the Apostle Saint Paul, they would resist the order established by God 
    Himself and would make themselves deserving of eternal damnation....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the new aristocracy contributed 
    to the image of France as the great nation and of Paris as the capital of 
    the world, the pomp and splendor of the imperial court and army--with their 
    glittering and exuberent uniforms, their glistening helmets and swords and 
    eagles, their dazzling balls, their clattering of calvalcades, their mixture 
    of feminine grace and military dash, their swanlike beauties and the grizzled 
    grenadiers, their counterpoint of violins and guns--provided a spectacle and 
    created a mystique that intoxicated a generation and set they style for a 
    century. France was intoxicated with glory, which enhanced life and nullified 
    death. It was a decidedly masculine mystique. Love, as Napoleon put it, was 
    &quot;the warriors relaxation.&quot; Woman's purpose was to bear sons, to 
    be beautiful and gentle, to adorn man's world with simpple grace, while men 
    strutted like peacocks in their plumes and gold braid...with a clatter of 
    swords and medals...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To create all this splendor, and 
    to make the impassive marble features and the sober silhouette of its creator 
    into the symbols they became, required the spending of human lives on a lavish 
    scale. But men and arms were cheap in those days...Men were chosen by lot. 
    During the period 1801-1804, 60,000 men were called up each year; in 1805 
    the figure jumped to 210,000, and the total for the period 1805-13 has been 
    estimated at more than 2,300,000 men...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The intoxication with glory did 
    not extend to the classes that furnished the bulk of the cannon fodder. With 
    each levy, the number of deserters rose; thousands mutilated themselves to 
    avoid conscription; and squads of gendarmes covered the country to track down 
    deserters...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I have only one passion, 
    only one mistress,&quot; the emperor once said, &quot;and that is France: 
    I sleep with her. She has never failed me, she has lavished her blood and 
    her treasures on me. If I need five hundred thousand men, she gives them to 
    me.&quot; She did indeed submit to his murderous embrace, but he was flattering 
    himself if he thought that he gave her much pleasure. The assertion that his 
    soldiers invariably adored him is a myth...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For more than two years after the 
    resumption of warfare between England and France in 1803, the Continent remained 
    at peace. By the close of 1804, however, it was clear that a new coalition 
    against France was in the making. In January, 1805, the English government 
    set aside the sum of five million pounds for subsidies to those monarchs who 
    would undertake to put land armies into the firld against France (the price 
    of men's lives, let it be repeated, was cheap) and began to press its negotiations 
    with the sovereigns of Russia, Austria and Prussia...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Peace of Pressburg (after the 
    Battle of Austerlitz) made Napoleon the master of Western Europe. The coalition 
    had been broken up, temporarily at least; Austria had been made innocuous; 
    the Holy Roman Empire had ceased to exist all but in name, and ceased to exist 
    in name also when, in 1806, Emperor Francis II, abdicated as Roman emperor, 
    retaining the title Francis I, emperor of Austria, which he had adopted in 
    1804. The empire of Napoleon now extended from the Atlantic to the borders 
    of the Ottoman Empire.&quot; </font>The Age of Napoleon, by J. Christopher

    faction-ridden period. In little more than half a century the facts had been 
    distorted by legend, partisan pamphlets, and uncritical eulogies. By getting 
    at the documentary sources a historian might be able to bring American History 
    into the 19th century scientific movement, to find laws of its movement and 
    perhaps predict its direction. Herbert Spencer's Theory of Social Evolution...raised 
    the hope of a genuine science of history.&quot;</font></p>

    power of decision had little influence upon the course of history was a hard 
    one to write by...He (Adams) justified the apparent inconsistencies of his

    define 'National Character.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Adams recognized that 
    his theory would be at best only an approach to truly scientific history, 
    one encounters in his pages evidence of his efforts to provide objective measurements 
    of the historical movement and of the forces at work...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, the central riddle 
    that defied solution was the movement of thought, the psychic component of
