  <p align="center">The Wars Of The Jews<br>
    Or The History Of The Destruction Of Jerusalem<br>
    Book VII<br>
    Containing The Interval Of About Three Years<br>
    From The Taking Of Jerusalem By Titus To The Sedition At Cyrene.</p>
  <p>Chapter X<br>
    THAT MANY OF THE SICARII FLED TO ALEXANDRIA ALSO AND WHAT DANGERS THEY WERE 
    IN THERE; ON WHICH ACCOUNT THAT TEMPLE WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN BUILT BY ONIAS 
    THE HIGH PRIEST WAS DESTROYED. </p>
  <p align="left">1. WHEN Masada was thus taken, the general left a garrison in 
    the fortress to keep it, and he himself went away to Cesarea; for there were 
    now no enemies left in the country, but it was all overthrown by so long a 
    war. Yet did this war afford disturbances and dangerous disorders even in 
    places very far remote from Judea; for still it came to pass that many Jews 
    were slain at Alexandria in Egypt; for as many of the Sicarii as were able 
    to fly thither, out of the seditious wars in Judea, were not content to have 
    saved themselves, but must needs be undertaking to make new disturbances, 
    and persuaded many of those that entertained them to assert their liberty, 
    to esteem the Romans to be no better than themselves, and to look upon God 
    as their only Lord and Master. But when part of the Jews of reputation opposed 
    them, they slew some of them, and with the others they were very pressing 
    in their exhortations to revolt from the Romans; but when the principal men 
    of the senate saw what madness they were come to, they thought it no longer 
    safe for themselves to overlook them. So they got all the Jews together to 
    an assembly, and accused the madness of the Sicarii, and demonstrated that 
    they had been the authors of all the evils that had come upon them. They said 
    also that &quot;these men, now THEY WERE RUN AWAY FROM JUDEA, having no sure 
    hope of escaping, because as soon as ever they shall be known, they will be 
    soon destroyed by the Romans, as they come hither and fill us full of those 
    calamities which belong to them, while we have not been partakers with them 
    in any of their sins.&quot;</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This was the 
    course of events in Palestine: for this is the name that has been given from 
    old to the whole country extending from Phoenicia to Egypt along the inner 
    sea. They also have another name that they have acquired: the country has 
    been named Judaea, and the people themselves Jews. </font></div>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do not know how this title came 
    to be given to them, but it applies also to the rest of mankind, although 
    of alien race, who affect their customs. This class exists even among the 
    Romans</font>.&quot; Dio's Roman History, 37.</p>
  <p></p>
  </blockquote>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center">
<p align="left">Accordingly, they exhorted the multitude to have a care, lest 
    they should be brought to destruction by their means, and to make their apology 
    to the Romans for what had been done, by delivering these men up to them; 
    who being thus apprized of the greatness of the danger they were in, complied 
    with what was proposed, and ran with great violence upon the Sicarii, and 
    seized upon them; and indeed SIX HUNDRED OF THEM were caught immediately: 
    but as to all those that fled into Egypt (18) and to the Egyptian Thebes, 
    it was not long ere they were caught also, AND BROUGHT BACK, whose courage, 
    or whether we ought to call it madness, or hardiness in their opinions, every 
    body was amazed at. For when all sorts of torments and vexations of their 
    bodies that could be devised were made use of to them, they could not get 
    any one of them to comply so far as to confess, or seem to confess, that Caesar 
    was their lord; but they preserved their own opinion, in spite of all the 
    distress they were brought to, as if they received these torments and the 
    fire itself with bodies insensible of pain, and with a soul that in a manner 
    rejoiced under them. But what was most of all astonishing to the beholders 
    was the courage of the children; for not one of these children was so far 
    overcome by these torments, as to name Caesar for their lord. So far does 
    the strength of the courage [of the soul] prevail over the weakness of the 
    body. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Josephus is making a subtle switch in his narrative 
    here. These Sicarri had fled into Egypt but were already brought back. They 
    are not in (that) Egypt when Caesar orders this temple in question to be demolished. 
    The land of Palestine, and that city in the East, is implied in the term &quot;Egypt&quot; 
    at Isaiah 30 and 31. Josephus could well be implying the same when he alludes 
    to the temple that Onias built. It is quite probable that this temple is a 
    cryptic reference to the temple in Jerusalem, or of one built near the present 
    temple mount, the remains of which existed there until Herod built his ediface 
    over the top of it. After all, Josephus's accounts of these matters is all 
    we have, and Josephus is an adept in the Christian mysteries. He is hiding 
    as much in his narratives as he reveals. We shall see:</font></p>
  <p align="left">2. Now Lupus did then govern Alexandria, who presently sent 
    Caesar word of this commotion; who having in suspicion the restless temper 
    of the Jews for innovation, and being afraid lest they should get together 
    again, and persuade some others to join with them, gave orders to Lupus TO 
    DEMOLISH THE JEWISH TEMPLE WHICH WAS IN THE REGION CALLED ONION, (19) AND 
    WAS IN EGYPT, which was built and had its denomination from the occasion following: 
    Onias, the son of Simon, one of the Jewish high priests fled from Antiochus 
    the king of Syria, when he made war with the Jews, AND CAME TO ALEXANDRIA; 
    and as Ptolemy received him very kindly, on account of hatred to Antiochus, 
    he assured him, that if he would comply with his proposal, he would bring 
    all the Jews to his assistance; and when the king agreed to do it so far as 
    he was able, HE DESIRED TO GIVE HIM LEAVE TO BUILD A TEMPLE SOME WHERE IN 
    EGYPT <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Palestine was in Egypt)</font>, 
    and to worship God according to the customs of his own country; for that the 
    Jews would then be so much readier to fight against Antiochus who had laid 
    waste TO THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(where?)</font>, 
    and that they would then come to him with greater good-will; and that, by 
    granting them liberty of conscience, very many of them would come over to 
    him.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"> 
  </p>
  <p align="left">3. So Ptolemy complied with his proposals, and gave him a place 
    one hundred and eighty furlongs distant from Memphis. (20) THAT NOMOS WAS 
    CALLED THE NOMOS OF HELIOPOLIS, where Onias built a fortress and a temple, 
    not like to that at Jerusalem, but such as resembled a tower. He built it 
    of large stones to the height of sixty cubits; he made THE STRUCTURE OF THE 
    ALTAR IN IMITATION OF THAT IN OUR COUNTRY <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(up 
    in the center of Europe)</font>, and in like manner adorned with gifts, excepting 
    the make of the candlestick, for he did not make a candlestick, but had a 
    [single] lamp hammered out of a single piece of brass. The temple area was 
    encompassed with a wall of burnt brick, though it had gates of stone. The 
    king also gave him a large country for a revenue in money, that both the priests 
    might have a plentiful provision made for them, and that God might have great 
    abundance of what piece of gold, which illuminated the place with its rays, 
    and which he hung by a chain of gold; BUT THE ENTIRE TEMPLE wathings were 
    necessary for his worship. Yet did not Onias do this out of a sober disposition, 
    but HE HAD A MIND TO CONTEND WITH THE JEWS AT JERUSALEM <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(where? 
    above)</font>, and could not forget the indignation he had for being banished 
    thence. Accordingly, he thought that by building this temple he should draw 
    away a great number from them to himself. There had been also a certain ancient 
    prediction made by [a prophet] whose name was Isaiah, about six hundred years 
    before, that this temple should be built by a man that was a Jew in Egypt 
    (Isaiah 19:18-23). AND THIS IS THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING OF THAT TEMPLE.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif" width="650" height="472"> 
  </p>
  <p align="left">4. And now Lupus, the governor of Alexandria, upon the receipt 
    of Caesar's letter, came to the temple, and carried out of it some of the 
    donations dedicated thereto, and shut up the temple itself. And as Lupus died 
    a little afterward, Paulinns succeeded him. This man left none of those donations 
    there, and threatened the priests severely if they did not bring them all 
    out; nor did he permit any who were desirous of worshipping God there so much 
    as to come near the whole sacred place; but when he had shut up the gates, 
    he made it entirely inaccessible, insomuch THAT THERE REMAINED NO LONGER THE 
    LEAST FOOTSTEPS OF ANY DIVINE WORSHIP THAT HAD BEEN IN THAT PLACE. Now the 
    duration of the time from the building of this temple till it was shut up 
    again was three hundred and forty-three years <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(What 
    year was this temple destroyed? And what year was it that Herod began to build 
    his temple)?.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Footnotes</p>
  <p align="left">(18) Since Josephus here informs us that some of these Sicarii, 
    or ruffians, went from Alexandria (which was itself in Egypt, in a large sense) 
    into Egypt, and Thebes there situated, Reland well observes, from Vossius, 
    that Egypt sometimes denotes Proper or Upper Egypt, as distinct from the Delta, 
    AND THE LOWER PARTS NEAR PALESTINE. Accordingly, as he adds, those that say 
    it never rains in Egypt must mean the Proper or Upper Egypt, because it does 
    sometimes rain in the other parts. See the note on Antiq. B. II. ch. 7. sect. 
    7, and B. III. ch. 1. sect. 6. </p>
  <p align="left">(19) Of this temple of Onias's building in Egypt, see the notes 
    on Antiq. B. XIII. ch. 3. sect. 1. But whereas it is elsewhere, both of the 
    War, B. I. ch. 1. sect. 1, AND IN THE ANTIQUITIES AS NOW QUOTED, SAID THAT 
    THIS TEMPLE WAS LIKE TO THAT AT JERUSALEM, and here that it was not like it, 
    but like a tower, sect. 3, THERE IS SOME REASON TO SUSPECT THE READING HERE, 
    and that either the negative particle is here to be blotted out, or the word 
    entirely added. </p>
  <p align="left">(20) We must observe, that Josephus here speaks of Antiochus 
    who profaned the temple as now alive, when Onias had leave given them by Philometer 
    to build his temple; whereas it seems not to have been actually built till 
    about fifteen years afterwards. Yet, because it is said in the Antiquities 
    that Onias went to Philometer, B. XII. ch. 9. sect. 7, during the lifetime 
    of that Antiochus, it is probable he petitioned, and perhaps obtained his 
    leave then, though it were not actually built or finished till fifteen years 
    afterward. </p>

    BUILT A TEMPLE IN EGYPT LIKE TO THAT AT JERUSALEM.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/IuDeA.gif" width="600" height="446"></p>
</div>
<div align="center">
  <p align="left">1. BUT then the son of Onias the high priest, who was of the 
    same name with his father, and who fled to king Ptolemy, who was called Philometor, 
    lived now at Alexandria, as we have said already. WHEN THIS ONIAS SAW THAT 
    JUDEA WAS OPPRESSED BY THE MACEDONIANS AND THEIR KINGS, out of a desire to 
    purchase to himself a memorial and eternal fame he resolved to send to king 
    Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra, to ask leave of them THAT HE MIGHT BUILD A TEMPLE 
    IN EGYPT LIKE TO THAT AT JERUSALEM, and might ordain Levites and priests out 
    of their own stock. The chief reason why he was desirous so to do, was, THAT 
    HE RELIED UPON THE PROPHET ISAIAH, who lived above six hundred years before, 
    AND FORETOLD THAT THERE CERTAINLY WAS TO BE A TEMPLE BUILT TO THE ALMIGHTY 
    GOD IN EGYPT by a man that was a Jew. Onias was elevated with this prediction, 
    and wrote the following epistle to Ptolemy and Cleopatra: </p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="center"> 
    <p align="left">&quot;Having done many and great things for you in the affairs 
      of the war, by the assistance of God, and that in Celesyria and Phoenicia, 
      I came at length with the Jews to Leontopolis, AND TO OTHER PLACES OF YOUR 
      NATION, where I found that the greatest part of your people had temples 
      in an improper manner, and that on this account they bare ill-will one against 
      another, which happens to the Egyptians by reason of the multitude of their 
      temples, and the difference of opinions about Divine worship. NOW I FOUND 
      A VERY FIT PLACE IN A CASTLE THAT HATH ITS NAME FROM THE COUNTRY DIANA; 
      this place is full of materials of several sorts, and replenished with sacred 
      animals; I DESIRE THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL GRANT ME LEAVE TO PURGE THIS HOLY 
      PLACE, WHICH BELONGS TO NO MASTER, AND IS FALLEN DOWN, AND TO BUILD A TEMPLE 
      THERE TO ALMIGHTY GOD, AFTER THE PATTERN OF THAT IN JERUSALEM, AND OF THE 
      SAME DIMENSIONS, that may be for the benefit of thyself, and thy wife and 
      children, THAT THOSE JEWS WHO DWELL IN EGYPT MAY HAVE APLACE WHITHER THEY 
      MAY COME AND MEET TOGETHER IN MUTUAL HARMONY ONE WITH ANOTHER, and be subservient 
      to thy advantages; FOR THE PROPHET ISAIAH FORETOLD THAT 'THERE SHOULD BE 
      AN ALTAR IN EGYPT TO THE LORD GOD'; (5) AND MANY OTHER THINGS DID HE PROPHESY 
      RELATING TO THAT PLACE.&quot;</p>

<div align="center"></div>
<div align="center"></div>
<div align="center"></div>
<div align="center">
<p align="left">2. And this was what Onias wrote to king Ptolemy. Now any one 
    may observe his piety, and that of his sister and wife Cleopatra, by that 
    epistle which they wrote in answer to it; for they laid the blame and the 
    transgression of the law upon the head of Onias. And this was their reply: 
  </p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="center"> 
    <p align="left">&quot;King Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra to Onias, send greeting. 
      We have read thy petition, wherein thou desirest leave to be given thee 
      TO PURGE THAT TEMPLE WHICH IS FALLEN DOWN AT LEONTOPOLIS, IN THE NOMOS OF 
      HELIOPOLIS, and which is named from the country BUBASTIS; on which account 
      we cannot but wonder that it should be pleasing to God to have a temple 
      erected in a place so unclean, and so full of sacred animals. BUT SINCE 
      THOU SAYEST THAT ISAIAH THE PROPHET FORETOLD THIS LONG AGO, WE GIVE THEE 
      LEAVE TO DO IT, if it may be done according to your law, and so that we 
      may not appear to have at all offended God herein.&quot;</p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left">
  <p>3. SO ONIAS TOOK THE PLACE, AND BUILT A TEMPLE, AND AN ALTAR TO GOD, LIKE 
    INDEED TO THAT IN JERUSALEM, BUT SMALLER AND POORER. I DO NOT THINK IT PROPER 
    FOR ME NOW TO DESCRIBE ITS DIMENSIONS OR ITS VESSELS, WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
    DESCRIBED IN MY SEVENTH BOOK OF THE WARS OF THE JEWS. However, Onias found 
    other Jews like to himself, together with priests and Levites, that there 
    performed Divine service. BUT WE HAVE SAID ENOUGH ABOUT THIS TEMPLE.</p>
</div>
<div align="center"> 
  <p align="left">4. NOW IT CAME TO PASS that the Alexandrian Jews, and those 
    Samaritans who paid their worship to the temple that was built in the days 
    of Alexander at Mount Gerizzim, did now make a sedition one against another, 
    AND DISPUTED ABOUT THEIR TEMPLES BEFORE PTOLEMY HIMSELF; the Jews saying that, 
    ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES, THE TEMPLE WAS TO BUILT AT JERUSALEM <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Is 
    this a veiled reference to Onias's temple? We think so. Josephus is switching 
    back and forth. He does not mention all three temples in the same narrative)</font>; 
    and the Samaritans saying that it was to be built at Gerizzim. They desired 
    therefore the king to sit with his friends, and hear the debates about these 
    matters, and punish those with death who were baffled. Now Sabbeus and Theodosius 
    managed the argument for the Samaritans, and Andronicus, the son of Messalamus, 
    for the people of Jerusalem; and they took an oath by God and the king to 
    make their demonstrations according to the law; and they desired of Ptolemy, 
    that whomsoever he should find that transgressed what they had sworn to, he 
    would put him to death. </p>
  <p align="left">Accordingly, the king took several of his friends into the council, 
    and sat down, in order to hear what the pleaders said. Now the Jews that were 
    at Alexandria were in great concern for those men, WHOSE LOT IT WAS TO CONTEND 
    FOR THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Where 
    is Onias' temple in this discord? Why aren't the Alexandrian Jews content 
    with their temple in Egypt)?</font>; for they took it very ill that any should 
    take away the reputation OF THAT TEMPLE, WHICH WAS SO ANCIENT AND SO CELEBRATED 
    ALL OVER THE INHABITABLE EARTH. Now when Sabbeus and Tlteodosius had given 
    leave to Andronicus to speak first, he began to demonstrate out of the law, 
    and out of the successions of the high priests, how they every one in succession 
    from his father had received that dignity, and ruled over the temple; and 
    how all the kings of Asia had honored that temple with their donations, and 
    with the most splendid gifts dedicated thereto. But as for that at Gerizzm, 
    he made no account of it, and regarded it as if it had never had a being. 
    BY THIS SPEECH, AND OTHER ARGUEMENTS, ANDRONICUS PERSUADED THE KING TO DETERMINE 
    THAT THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM WAS BUILT ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF MOSES, (6) 
    and to put Sabbeus and Theodosius to death. And these were the events that 
    befell the Jews at Alexandria in the days of Ptolemy Philometor.</p>
  <p align="left">Footnotes</p>
  <p align="left">(5) It seems to me CONTRARY TO THE OPINION OF JOSEPHUS, and 
    of the moderns, both Jews and Christians, that this prophecy of Isaiah, 19:19, 
    etc.</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>&quot;In that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the 
      land of Egypt,&quot; etc.</p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left"> 
  <p>...directly foretold the building of this temple of Onias in Egypt, and was 
    a sufficient warrant to the Jews for building it, and for worshipping the 
    true God, the God of Israel, therein. See Authent. Rec. 11. p. 755. That God 
    seems to have soon better accepted of the sacrifices and prayers here offered 
    him than those at Jerusalem <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(but 
    if they are the same temple, or rather, if they were both built in the same 
    place)?</font>, see the note in Book 13, Ch. 10. Sect. 7,</p>
  <p> Footnote #30. And truly the marks of Jewish corruption or interpolation 
    in this text, in order to discourage their people from approving of the Worship 
    of God here, are very strong, and highly deserve our consideration and correction. 
    The foregoing verse in Isaiah runs thus in our common copies, </p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left">&quot;In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak 
    the language of Canaan,&quot; [the Hebrew language: shall be full of Jews, 
    whose sacred books were in Hebrew,] &quot;and swear to the Lord of hosts; 
    ONE&quot; [or the first] &quot;SHALL BE CALLED, THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION,&quot; 
    (Isaiah 19:18).</div>
</blockquote>
<div align="center"> 
  <p align="left">A strange-name, &quot;City of Destruction,&quot; upon so joyful 
    occasion, and a name never heard of in the land of Egypt, or perhaps in any 
    other nation. THE OLD READING WAS EVIDENTLY THE CITY OF THE SUN, OR HELIOPOLIS 
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Exactly)!</font> and Unkelos, in 
    effect, and Symmachus, with the Arabic version, entirely confess that to be 
    the true reading. The Septuagint also, though they have the text disguised 
    in the common copies, and CALL IT ASEDEK, THE CITY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Understand 
    Malachi, chapter 4)</font>; yet in two or three other copies the Hebrew word 
    itself for the Sun, Achares, or Thares, is preserved. And since Onias insists 
    with the king and queen, THAT ISAIAH'S PROPHECY CONTAINED MANY OTHER PREDICTIONS 
    RELATING TO THIS PLACE BESIDES THE WORDS RECITED BY HIM, it is highly probable 
    that these were especially meant by him; and that one main reason why he applied 
    this prediction to himself, and to his prefecture of Heliopolis, which Dean 
    Prideaux well proves was in that part of Egypt, and why he chose to build 
    in that prefecture of Heliopolis, though otherwise an improper place, was 
    this, that the same authority that he had for building this temple in Egypt, 
    the very same he had for building it in his own prefecture of Heliopolis also, 
    which he desired to do, and which he did accordingly. Dean Prideaux has much 
    ado to avoid seeing this corruption of the Hebrew; but it being in support 
    of his own opinion about this temple, he durst not see it; and indeed he reasons 
    here in the most injudicious manner possible. See him at the year 149. </p>
  <p>(6) A very unfair disputation this! while the Jewish disputant, knowing that 
    he could not properly prove out of the Pentateuch, that </p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left">&quot;the place which the Lord their God shall choose to place 
    his name there,&quot;</div>
</blockquote>
<div align="center">
  <p align="left">...so often referred to in the Book of Deuteronomy, was Jerusalem 
    any more than Gerizzim, that being not determined till the days of David, 
    Antiq. B. VII. Ch. 13. Sect. 4, proves only, what the Samaritans did not deny, 
    that the temple at Jerusalem was much more ancient, and much more celebrated 
    and honored, than that at Gerizzim, which was nothing to the present purpose. 
    The whole evidence, by the very oaths of both parties, being, we see, obliged 
    to be confined to the law of Moses, or to the Pentateuch alone. However, worldly 
    policy and interest and the multitude prevailing, the court gave sentence, 
    as usual, on the stronger side and poor Sabbeus and Theodosius, the Samaritan 
    disputants, were martyred, and this, so far as appears, without any direct 
    hearing at all, which is like the usual practice of such political courts 
    about matters of religion. Our copies say that the body of the Jews were in 
    a great concern about those men (in the plural) who were to dispute for their 
    temple at Jerusalem, whereas it seems here they had but one disputant, Andronicus 
    by name. Perhaps more were prepared to speak on the Jews' side; but the firstraying 
    answered to his name, and overcome the Samaritans, there was necessity for 
    any other defender of the Jerusalem temple. </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Onias</font></p>
  <p align="left">Name of several high priests at the time of the Second Temple. 
    The sequence given them below is based on the statements of Josephus, which 
    are unreliable, since Josephus did not have access to trustworthy sources.</p>
</div>
<p>Onias I.: </p>
<p>Son of the Jaddua mentioned in Neh. xii. 11, according to Josephus (&quot;Ant.&quot; 
  xi. 8, &sect; 7); this Jaddua is said to have been a contemporary of Alexander 
  the Great, but I Macc. xii. 7, 8, 20 regards Onias as a contemporary of the 
  Spartan king Areus (309-265 B.C.). Yet it is doubtful whether Onias I. is meant, 
  for the entire correspondence and the treaty with the Spartans are probably 
  fictitious. The Simon (I.) the Just extolled in Ecclus. (Sirach) 1. 1 and in 
  legend (according to the Hebrew text the son of Jonathan, but according to the 
  Greek text the son of Onias) was probably the son of Onias I. Many scholars 
  take Simon the Just to be the second of that name, in which case a later date 
  must be assigned to his son Onias II.</p>
<p>Onias II.: </p>
<p>SON OF SIMON THE JUST <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The Druid/Hebrew 
  High Priest of Central Europe)</font>. He was still a minor when his father 
  died, so that his uncle Eleazar, and after him the latter's uncle Manasseh, 
  officiated as high priests before he himself succeeded to that dignity (Josephus, 
  &quot;Ant.&quot; xii. 4, &sect; 1). According to Josephus, he was a covetous 
  man and of limited intelligence, whose refusal to pay the twenty talents of 
  silver which every high priest was required to pay to the King of Egypt threatened 
  to imperil both the high priest and the people; but at this juncture Joseph, 
  the clever son of Tobias and nephew of Onias, succeeded in pacifying King Ptolemy 
  III. (Euergetes). Onias is said (ib. &sect; 10) to have died, almost simultaneously 
  with his nephew Joseph, during the reign of Seleucus Soter, hence about 181 
  B.C. His successor in office was his son Simon II.</p>
<p>Onias III.: </p>
<p>Son of Simon II. He is described as a pious man who, unlike the Hellenizers, 
  fought for Judaism (II Macc. iii.-iv.). Seleucus Philopator defrayed all the 
  expenses connected with the sanctuary and was friendly to the Jews. A traitorous 
  official of the Temple, however, Simon the Benjamite, induced the king to undertake 
  the plunder of the Temple treasury (see Heliodorus); the attempt was not successful, 
  and the Syrian court never forgave the high priest for its miscarriage. When 
  Antiochus IV. (Epiphanes) became king, Onias was obliged to yield to his own 
  brother Jason (II Macc. iv. 7). According to Josephus (&quot;Ant.&quot; xii. 
  5, &sect; 1), Jason became high priest after the death of Onias, the latter's 
  son, who bore the same name, being then a minor. It is strange that both father 
  and son should have been named Onias, and still more strange is the statement 
  of Josephus that the high priest who succeeded Jason and was the brother of 
  Onias and Jason, likewise was called Onias, and did not assume the name of Menelaus 
  until later; for according to this statement there must have been two brothers 
  of the same name.</p>
<p>While this confusion may be due to the Greek transcription of the related Hebrew 
  names Johanan, ?onya, and Ne?onya, THE ACCOUNT OF JOSEPHUS APPEARS WHOLLY UNRELIABLE 
  for this very reason. According to II Macc. iv. 23, Menelaus was not an Aaronite, 
  but a brother of the Simon mentioned above, and hence a Benjamite. When Menelaus 
  purloined some vessels from the Temple to curry favor with the Syrian nobles, 
  Onias accused him publicly and then fled to the asylum of Daphne, near Antioch, 
  where Menelaus, aided by the royal governor Andronicus, had him secretly assassinated, 
  in defiance of justice and of his oath. The murdered priest was deeply mourned 
  by both Jews and Greeks, and the king also, on his return, wept for him and 
  sentenced Andronicus to a well-merited death (II Macc. iv. 29-39).</p>
<p>Wellhausen and Willrich regard the story of the murder of Onias, as well as 
  the entire list of high priests from Jaddua to the Maccabees, AS LEGENDARY, 
  while Sch&uuml;rer and Niese consider them historical.The passage in Dan. ix. 
  26, &quot;shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself,&quot; is generally 
  referred to the murder of Onias (comp. Baethgen in Stade's &quot;Zeitschrift,&quot; 
  1886, vi. 278). Onias III. is the central figure of the legendary history of 
  later times; the Byzantine &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; says that he officiated 
  for twenty-four years, thus placing the beginning of his term of office under 
  Egyptian rule. The Byzantine &quot;Chronographeion Syntomon&quot; follows Josephus 
  in mentioning &quot;another Onias&quot; as the successor of Onias III., referring 
  probably to Menelaus, who ought, perhaps, to be added to this list as Onias 
  IV.; an account of his life is given, however, in Jew. Encyc. viii. 491, s.v. 
  Menelaus.</p>
<p>Onias IV. (V.): </p>
<p>Son of Onias III. and the lawful heir of the legitimate high priests. He had 
  reason to hope that the victory of the national party under Judas Maccabeus 
  would place him in the office of his fathers; but being disappointed in his 
  expectations by the election of Alcimus, HE WENT TO EGYPT to seek aid against 
  the tyranny of the Seleucids at the court of the Ptolemies, their political 
  enemies. About 154, with the permission of Ptolemy VI. (Philometor), he built 
  at Leontopolis a temple which, though comparatively small, was modeled on that 
  of Jerusalem, and was called by the name of its founder. Onias doubtless expected 
  that after the desecration of the Temple at Jerusalem by the Syrians the Egyptian 
  temple would be regarded as the only legitimate one; BUT THE TRADITIONAL TEACHINGS 
  OF JUDAISM, AS CONTAINED IN THE MISHNA, CONCEDE ONLY QUASI-LEGITIMATE STATUS 
  TO THE TEMPLE OF IONIAS (Men. xiii. 10); IN FACT, EVEN FOR EGYPTIAN JEWS THE 
  LATTER DID NOT POSSESS THE SAME IMPORTANCE AS DID THE (HIGHER) TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM.</p>
<p>Onias IV., who enjoyed the favor of the Egyptian court, succeeded in elevating 
  Egyptian Judaism to a position of dignity and importance. A large number of 
  able-bodied Judeans had accompanied Onias to Egypt, and these strangers, who 
  were there called (&quot;inhabitants&quot;), received, on condition of performing 
  military service and preserving the internal peace of the country, tracts of 
  land of their own, on which they lived with their families (&quot;Ant.&quot; 
  xi. 8, &sect; 6; see Paul Meyer in &quot;Philologus,&quot; 1897, lvi. 193). 
  The district inhabited by them lay between Memphis and Pelusium, and was long 
  called the &quot;country of Onias&quot; (&quot;Ant.&quot; xiv. 8, &sect; 1; 
  &quot;B. J.&quot; i. 9, &sect; 4). The first-born sons of the colonists inherited 
  their fathers' privileges and duties; but both Chelkias and Ananias, the sons 
  of Onias, performed military service and acted as generals under Cleopatra III. 
  (117-81; &quot;Ant.&quot; xiii. 10, &sect; 4). Even Ptolemy Physcon (146-117) 
  had to fight against Onias, who was faithful to his benefactor (Josephus, &quot;Contra 
  Ap.&quot; ii. 5), which proves that candidates for the office of high priest 
  occupied a prominent military position. In the course of time the family of 
  Onias lost its prestige, and the later Alabarchs belonged to another family, 
  not entitled to the rank of high priest. A family of &quot;Oniades,&quot; in 
  the sense of &quot;Tobiades,&quot; as the term is used by B&uuml;chler, existed 
  neither in Palestine nor in Egypt, and the designation &quot;Oniades&quot; is, 
  therefore, misleading.</p>

  Sacrifices Made There. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Place in the nome of Heliopolis, Egypt, situated 180 stadia from Memphis; famous 
  as containing a Jewish sanctuary, the only one outside of Jerusalem where sacrifices 
  were offered. Aside from a somewhat uncertain allusion of the Hellenist Artapanus 
  (in Eusebius, &quot;Pr&aelig;paratio Evangelica,&quot; ix. 23), only Josephus 
  gives information of this temple (more explicitly in his &quot;Antiquities&quot; 
  of the Jews than in his &quot;Jewish War&quot;). The Talmudic accounts are entirely 
  confused. The establishment of a central sanctuary in Egypt was not due to the 
  disorders that arose in Palestine under Antiochus IV., Epiphanes, to the desecration 
  of the sanctuary at Jerusalem, to the supplanting of the legitimate family of 
  priests by the installation of Alcimus, nor to the personal ambition of Onias 
  IV., but to the vast extent of the Jewish diaspora in Egypt itself.</p>
<p>Founded by Onias IV.</p>
<p>It would appear from the account of Josephus in the &quot;Jewish War&quot; 
  (i. 1, &sect; 1), and more especially from the fact that Onias is called in 
  the same work (vii. 10, &sect; 2) &quot;the son of Simon,&quot; that the temple 
  of Leontopolis was built by Onias III., who drove the sons of Tobias from Jerusalem, 
  and who fled to Egypt, Syria's ancient rival, when Antiochus IV. attacked that 
  city. But this account is contradicted by the story that Onias III. was murdered 
  at Antioch in 171 B.C. (II Macc. iv. 33). Josephus' account in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; 
  is therefore more probable, namely, that the builder of the temple was a son 
  ofthe murdered Onias III., and that, a mere youth at the time of his father's 
  death, he had fled to the court of Alexandria in consequence of the Syrian persecutions, 
  perhaps because he thought that salvation would come to his people from Egypt 
  (&quot;Ant.&quot; xii. 5, &sect; 1; ib. 9, &sect; 7). Ptolemy VI. Philometor 
  was King of Egypt at that time. He probably had not yet given up his claims 
  to C&#156;le-Syria and Judea, and gladly gave refuge to such a prominent personage 
  of the neighboring country. Onias now requested the king and his sister and 
  wife, Cleopatra, to allow him to build a sanctuary in Egypt similar to the one 
  at Jerusalem, where he would employ Levites and priests of his own race (ib. 
  xiii. 3, &sect; 1); and he referred to the prediction of the prophet Isaiah 
  (Isa. xix. 19) that a Jewish temple would be erected in Egypt (&quot;Ant.&quot; 
  l.c.).</p>
<p>Spuriousness of the Onias Letters.</p>
<p>Josephus then quotes two documents: Onias' letter to the royal couple, and 
  the king's answer to Onias. Both of these, however, appear spurious, on the 
  following grounds: Onias refers in his letter to his military exploits in C&#156;le-Syria 
  and Phenicia, although it is not certain that the general Onias and the priest 
  Onias are identical. His assertion that a central sanctuary is necessary because 
  a multiplicity of temples causes dissension among the Jews evidences imperfect 
  knowledge of the Jewish religious life; and, finally, his request FOR THE RUINED 
  TEMPLE OF THE GODDESS BUBASTIS, because a sufficient supply of wood and sacrificial 
  animals would be found there, seems unwise and improbable for a suppliant who 
  must first obtain compliance with his principal request....</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Bast is identified with the Sun mostly the gentle rising sun,at dawn, and 
    as such she is called both &quot;Lady of the East&quot; and &quot;The Lightbearer&quot;. 
    However,Bast is also concidered a Moon Goddess (cats can see in the dark,and 
    their eyes glow like the moon). Black cats were especially sacred to her, 
    but all animals are under her protection ( even dogs!). And the ancient Egyptian 
    Physicians used the symbol for the black cat in healing. The color green seems 
    to be a very important color for Bast, which makes sense because of affiliation 
    with nature in general, but also the color green is a very balancing color, 
    it sits right in the center of the color spectrum and is concidered to be 
    a very healing color. Being a Goddess of music, one of her symbols is the 
    Sistrum, and of course the Ankh.</p>
  <p> Bast is also known as the Goddess of fire,childbirth and fertility,pleasure,joy,dance,protection 
    against disease and evil spirits,intuition,healing,and marriage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Tell Basta is the modern name for the site of Per-Bastet (the 'Domain of 
    Bastet'), named in ancient times as the home of the cult of the cat-goddess 
    Bastet, a daughter of the sun-god who took on the role of a protective mother-goddess 
    and was associated with fertility. The Greeks called this eastern Delta town, 
    Bubastis. It was visited in the 5th century BC by the Greek historian Herodotus, 
    who described the town as having a beautiful temple on low ground in the centre 
    of the city and surrounded by tree-lined canals, giving it the appearance 
    of being on an island. A stone paved road led from a Temple of Hermes to a 
    huge carved gateway which dominated the entrance to the Temple of Bastet and 
    inside was a shrine containing a statue of the goddess. Herodotus gave a vivid 
    account of the annual festival of the goddess Bastet, when an estimated 700,000 
    Egyptian pilgrims would visit the site. Many details of Herodotus's description 
    were confirmed by Edouard Naville's investigation of Temple of Bastet for 
    the Egypt Exploration Fund during 1887-9.<br>
    <br>
    Although it had been occupied as early as Dynasty IV through to the end of 
    the Roman Period, the town reached its prominence during the Third Intermediate 
    Period and in the Late period it was the capital of the 18th Lower Egyptian 
    nome.<br>
    <br>
    Of the earliest remains, re-used blocks bearing the names of Dynasty IV kings 
    have been found - Khufu and Khafre apparently began cult temples here. Tell 
    Basta covers a large area, bisected by a road, with the sites of ka temples 
    of Teti and Pepy I of Dynasty VI situated on the western side, but only a 
    few of scattered remains of columns mark the structures which have almost 
    entirely disappeared. An Old Kingdom cemetery has been uncovered near the 
    northern edge of the site as well as an even earlier Protodynastic tomb.<br>
    <br>
    A heb-sed (jubilee) chapel built by Amenemhet III (Dynasty XII) shows that 
    Tell Basta was in use during the Middle Kingdom and a mudbrick palace found 
    on the north-eastern edge of the site in 1962 and thought to belong to this 
    king, is currently being restored. The palace has a number of halls, chambers 
    and columns and plaques depicting Bastet and statues of Amenemhet III and 
    his ministers were also found there. A large area of Graeco-Roman mudbrick 
    store-houses has also recently been unearthed near the palace site.<br>
    <br>
    The Temple of Bastet on the south-eastern side of the road through Tell Basta 
    is considered to be the most important structure on the site. Built from red 
    granite, some of the blocks found in the structure indicate that it was probably 
    constructed on Old Kingdom foundations and may have had additions by Rameses 
    II, but the temple is now greatly damaged and an exact plan has never been 
    successfully produced. A hoard of gold and silver vessels and jewellery was 
    discovered by local workmen near the temple site in 1906, the earliest pieces 
    dating to the Ramesside period. Some of these treasures were taken illicitly 
    out of Egypt and were subsequently acquired by Berlin and the New York Metropolitan 
    Museums. A second similar hoard was found later the same year a few metres 
    from the site of the first discovery and is now in Cairo Museum.<br>
    <br>
    Per-Bastet, on the route from Memphis to Sinai and Asia, was strategically 
    an important place from early times but reached its peak during the Third 
    Intermediate Period. The Delta's capital had been (and possibly still was) 
    at Tanis, where many of the kings of the period were buried, but the Libyan 
    rulers of Dynasty XXII seem to have chosen Bubastis as their Delta residence, 
    strengthening their Egyptian ties by building new religious structures around 
    the site of the Temple of Bastet. Osorlon I (Sekhemkheperre) may have begun 
    by decorating the existing walls with new reliefs and was probably the ruler 
    who built a small Temple of Atum outside the main structure. Osorkon II (Usermaatre) 
    built a new court and entrance hall and constructed a massive granite gateway 
    with very high quality reliefs to commemorate his sed-festival in his 22nd 
    year. A festival hall and hypostyle hall was built by Osorkon III (Usermaatre) 
    who also built a Temple of Maahes (Myhos), the lion-headed son of Bastet. 
    Another of her sons was called Horekhenu, who was probably also revered in 
    the area. The history of this period still uncertain and it is sometimes impossible 
    to sort out the confusing succession of kings because they often chose similar 
    names and epithets. Later, a new sanctuary was incorporated into the temple 
    by Nectanebo II (Dynasty XXX) and another temple was built by the Romans.<br>
    <br>
    In 1997 a limestone statue was found in the nearby encroaching town of Zagazig, 
    about 300m from the ka temple of Pepy and depicts a woman with her three children, 
    seated on a chair with lion's legs and flanked by baboons. It is thought that 
    the statue may date to the New Kingdom or possibly later.<br>
    <br>
    There are many cemetery sites around Tell Basta. Recent excavations to the 
    north of the Bastet Temple have revealed important burials dating to the New 
    Kingdom including the tomb of Iuti, a Dynasty XIX vizier and tombs of two 
    Viceroys of Kush, a father and son both named Hori, dating to Dynasties XIX 
    and XX. Bastet was originally a lion-headed goddess who began to be depicted 
    as a friendlier cat-headed woman during the Third Intermediate Period. Extensive 
    animal cemeteries began to appear during this time to the north of the site, 
    particularly for the burial of millions of mummified cats which were associated 
    with the local cult. The cat cemetery consists of a series of vaulted mudbrick 
    tombs about 200m north of the temple ruins.<br>
    <br>
    A thousand-year-old well found among the ruins has a legend attached to it 
    which links it to the journey of the Holy Family through Egypt. Scattered 
    over the ground are thousands of sherds of pottery used over the centuries 
    to draw water from the well and then smashed against a statue of the 'lucky 
    cat-goddess'.<br>
    <br>
    Bubastis may once have been the place where thousands of pilgrims came to 
    sing and dance the festival of Bastet, but today it resembles little more 
    than a derelict area on the edge of the urban sprawl of the town of Zagazig. 
    The ancient town which once played an important part in Egyptian history is 
    now in danger of being destroyed as an archaeological site - with modern housing 
    now covering about two-thirds of the area. Scattered inscribed stones and 
    column fragments indicate that this is an archaeological site which is still 
    undergoing excavation by an Egyptian team.<br>
    <br>
    Saft el-Hinna <br>
    <br>
    A few kilometres to the south-east of Bubastis, in a village called Saft el-Hinna, 
    is the site of the ancient city of Per-Sopdu (Per-Soped), once the capital 
    of the 20th Lower Egyptian nome. The city was the primary cult centre of the 
    Falcon-god Sopdu during Dynasty XXII. Known as a personification of the eastern 
    frontier of Egypt and represented either as a crouching falcon or a bearded 
    man wearing a head-dress with two falcon feathers, Sopdu was also worshipped 
    in Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai peninsula as the guardian of eastern desert 
    routes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Remains of brick-built temple enclosure walls at the site were investigated 
    by Edouard Naville in 1885. Other than several uninscribed basalt blocks, 
    the earliest dated finds are a few statue fragments of Rameses II. Of later 
    artefacts a granite naos of Sopdu built by Nectanebo I (Kheperkare) of Dynasty 
    XXX was perhaps the most impressive of the remains and a fragmentary granite 
    statue of Nectanebo I from Saft el-Hinna is now in the British Museum. It 
    has also been suggested that a stela naming a little-known ruler of Dynasty 
    XIV, Merdjedefre, who is depicted offering to Soped 'Lord of the East', may 
    have originated at Saft el-Hinna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...It seems strange, furthermore, that in the second letter the pagan king 
  points out to the Jewish priest that the proposed building of a temple is contrary 
  to the law, and that he consents only in view of Isaiah's prophecy. Both letters 
  were apparently written by a Hellenistic Jew. Only this can be stated as a fact, 
  that the temple of Leontopolis was built on the site of a ruined temple of Bubastis, 
  in imitation of the temple at Jerusalem, though smaller and less elaborate (ib. 
  xiii. 3, &sect; 3). The statement in &quot;B. J.&quot; vii. 10, &sect; 2 of 
  Onias' argument that by the building of this temple the whole Jewish nation 
  would be brought to turn from the Syrians to the Ptolemies seems very plausible, 
  and may have given rise to the assertion made in the letters that there were 
  dissensions among the Jews. The &quot;fortress&quot; (?????&micro;a) of the 
  temple of Bubastis may be explained by the statement, which seems credible, 
  that Onias built a fortress (????????) around the temple in order to protect 
  the surrounding territory, which now received the designation &quot;Oneion&quot; 
  (&quot;B. J.&quot; vii. 10, &sect; 3).</p>
<p>The Onias temple was not exactly similar to the Temple at Jerusalem, being 
  more in the form of a high tower; and as regards the interior arrangement, it 
  had not a candelabrum, but a hanging lamp. The building had a court (t?&micro;e???) 
  which was surrounded by a brick wall with stone gates. The king endowed the 
  temple with large revenues (ib.)&#151;a fact that may have suggested to the 
  writer of the letters mentioned above the wealth of wood and sacrificial animals.</p>
<p>Sacrifices Made There.</p>
<p>The reputation which the temple of Onias enjoyed is indicated by the fact that 
  the Septuagint changes the phrase &quot;city of destruction&quot; (Isa. xix. 
  18) to &quot;city of righteousness&quot; (p???? ?sed??). It may be taken for 
  granted that the Egyptian Jews sacrificed frequently in the temple of Leontopolis, 
  although at the same time they fulfilled their duty toward the Temple at Jerusalem, 
  as Philo narrates that he himself did (&quot;De Providentia,&quot; in Eusebius, 
  l.c. viii. &sect;&sect; 14, 64).</p>
<p>In the Talmud the origin of the temple of Onias is narrated with legendary 
  additions, there being two versions of the account (Men. 109b). It must be noted 
  that here also Onias is mentioned as the son of Simon, and that Isaiah's prophecy 
  is referred to. In regard to the Law the temple of Onias (, handed down in the 
  name of Saadia Gaon as ) was looked upon as neither legitimate nor illegitimate, 
  but as standing midway between the worship of Yhwh and idolatry (Men. 109a; 
  Tosef., Men. xiii. 12-14); the possibility of the priests of Onias being admitted 
  to officiate at Jerusalem was explicitly stated, while one passage even expresses 
  the view that sacrificial worship was permissible in the temple of Onias (Meg. 
  10a). The opinion was prevalent among the Rabbis that the temple of Onias was 
  situated at Alexandria&#151;an error that is repeated by all the chroniclers 
  of the Middle Ages. This temple is also sometimes confounded with the Samaritan 
  temple on Mount Gerizim. (&quot;Yu?asin,&quot; ed. London, pp. 11b, 13b; Azariah 
  dei Rossi, &quot;Me'or 'Enayim,&quot; ed. Mantua, xxi. 89a; Gans, &quot;?ema? 
  Dawid,&quot; ed. Offenbach, ii. 10; Heilprin, &quot;Seder ha-Dorot,&quot; ed. 
  Warsaw, 1891, i. 116).</p>
<p>According to Josephus, the temple of Leontopolis existed for 343 years, though 
  the general opinion is that this number must be changed to 243. It was closed 
  either by the governor of Egypt, Lupus, or by his successor, Paulinus, about 
  three years after the destruction of the Temple at Jerusalem; and the sacrificial 
  gifts, or rather the interior furnishings, were confiscated for the treasury 
  of Vespasian (&quot;B. J.&quot; vii. 10, &sect; 4), the emperor fearing that 
  through this temple Egypt might become a new center for Jewish rebellion. No 
  ruins have so far been discovered of this temple, once so famous; perhaps the 
  present Tell al-Yahudi marks its site (Ebers, &quot;Durch Gosen zum Sinai,&quot; 
  pp. 497 et seq.).</p>
