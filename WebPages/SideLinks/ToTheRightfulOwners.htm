<p><font size="+1">It was startling. At Union Square that Sunday afternoon, over 
  a month since September 11, there in the midst of an assembled crowd of observers, 
  photographers and reporters, the very center of everyone's attention, was an 
  American Indian man. (Russel Means said that <i>American Indian</i> is a proper 
  term. He said that he has accepted its connotation, <i>In-dios</i>, &quot;a 
  people near to,&quot; or &quot;of God.&quot; Names have been a little confusing 
  for those of us who are trying to connect ourselves to <i>the Whole, </i>and 
  to reverence everyone's own sense of themselves in the process. Until I am told 
  otherwise I will use it. I have been <i>told</i>, so I do not sing <i>This land 
  is your land, this land is my land </i>any longer). This man was chanting a 
  song in his native tongue, to the beat of his drum and the rhythmic shaking 
  of a ceremonial rattle . Many of us, feeling humbled in his presence, were being 
  carried along on every note, and every beat, until he stopped. There was stillness. 
  Then someone asked the meaning of his song. He replied in words such as these: 
  &quot;I am an original person. I am a true American. When they attack this nation 
  they attack me.&quot; I was a little confused. What was he saying? &quot;If 
  they do not like this country,&quot; he continued, &quot;let them get out of 
  it. There are plenty of airplanes, let them take one. If they want to burn their 
  draft cards, well let them go to another country.&quot; It became apparent that 
  it was this man who was confused about many things, at least from my point of 
  view. &quot;I am the color of the earth,&quot; he said. &quot;First they came 
  and took away my land...&quot; &quot;Friend,&quot; I interrupted, &quot;that's 
  why many people burn their draft cards, because of what was done to your people, 
  and your land.&quot; The idea fell on deaf ears. He replied, &quot;When you 
  attack George Bush, you attack me. This is a great nation. If you do not like 
  it, or if you want to attack it, get out of it...or else you will have to deal 
  with me.&quot; </font><font size="+1">&quot;Well, the white man is not the only 
  one who is bewildered and confused about these events&quot; I said to myself 
  walking away. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In August, just before this fateful September, I had been invited 
  by our friends, Tim and Maia, to come out and visit the San Francisco Bay area 
  where they were now living. I had time before the High Holy Days, which I have 
  been observing in New York City for the past several years. But what to make 
  of such an adventure? I had not been across the country since returning from 
  military service in 1967. Why not A Journey of Atonement, befitting the times 
  and my own spiritual needs? Why not stop at many places along the way and ask 
  God's forgiveness for the atrocities that have been committed, most perceivably 
  at the hands of Europeans against all others on this continent, for all the 
  blood that has been shed, people enslaved, and lands stolen. I threw some clothes 
  and my books in the back of the station wagon and set out for West Virginia, 
  the first stop. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It might be said that this spiritual journey began in the early 
  70s when our family came to these West Virginia hills from New York, in search 
  of God, seeking community. There were many people leaving their old lifestyles 
  in those times, and their old frames of mind. There was a revolution going on, 
  all over the country, taking many forms, addressing many issues (race, war, 
  power, wealth, poverty, gender, the environment, violence, oppression and injustice 
  in all of its forms), the effects of which are still yet to be fully realized. 
  And, of course, many things had come to pass in the world since then. Now here 
  I was, over twenty five seemingly-bewildered years, and many hard-learned lessons 
  later, back here staring across the Ohio River wondering which way to start 
  off across this continent, to complete this American journey. </font></p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../UsedImages/pg210.gif"><img src="../../UsedImages/OhioRiver.jpg" width="600" height="387" border="0"></a></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had been to this place along the river many times since coming 
  to live here, mostly with the grandchildren now, looking over to Ohio, watching 
  the tugs and barges plying their way from Pittsburg, past Cincinnati to the 
  Mississippi and back again. Rivers keep a record of time. You can sit along 
  side of them and see into the past. We reminded ourselves often that the land 
  we were looking at over there was at one time, not too many decades of years 
  ago, not American soil. I wanted the children to know, and never to forget, 
  that that land, called the Ohio Territory then, was stolen by force from its 
  original inhabitants. We spoke at times of Chief Logan, a &quot;friend,&quot; 
  whose entire family was nevertheless murdered by American colonists (&quot;There 
  is not a drop of my blood running through the veins of any living being now,&quot; 
  he said). And of Cornstork, and the defeat he and the Shawnee nation experienced 
  along the river at Point Pleasant at the time of the American revolution. We 
  had even visited that site, and the grave of Cornstork who was also murdered 
  by colonists in an act of retribution. There is a very obscene monument erected 
  there by the D.A.R., or some such organization, dedicated to the triumphant 
  defeat of the <i>savage</i> Indians, making those territories <i>safe </i>for 
  habitation. Perhaps it is not as obscene as the many other monuments that have 
  been set up across the American political landscape. The one in the center of 
  downtown Indianapolis is particularly incriminating, as is the memorial out 
  there in Indiana to George Rogers Clark and his band of American renegades and 
  cutthroats. I have taken the children to many of these places. We had also already 
  visited many of the archaeological sites and remains of what was once a highly 
  civilized and spiritual culture dwelling throughout the Ohio River Valley. We 
  had already prayed on top of the mounds at Marietta and Moundsville, so I reasoned 
  that I would not have to go in that direction this time. And we had already 
  sat and held hands together in prayer at the Serpent Mound, right there in the 
  spiral center of the Serpent's tail. (There was a very large gathering of people 
  on this mound at the time of the Harmonic Convergance in 1987, but this time 
  the park attendant threatened us with expulsion for being on the sacred mound 
  itself. We apologized and got up). This mound was erected in the time of Christ, 
  and could only have been built by those who knew the symbolisms in the books 
  of Genesis and Revelation...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/MysteryMound.gif" width="503" height="274"></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Seven turns from the spiral Mystery to the Great Event, 
    (Revelation 12:1-4; 7-11).</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We spoke of Tecumseh and his heroic, but fruitless efforts 
  to keep the Americans from further encroachments into the Northwest Territories. 
  We had visited Vincennes, the capital of those territories after Ohio had become 
  a state, and had formed a prayer circle, two grandfathers and a <i>joy of children</i>, 
  on the top of an old overgown and neglected mound we found there. I am sure 
  the children do not remember the details or the names, but we compared William 
  Henry Harrison, the governor of those territories, and who also became president, 
  with Andrew Jackson who was also an Indian killer, and who, as president, was 
  responsible for enforcing the Indian Removal Act, thus for the expulsion of 
  the Cherokee people and others from their ancestral lands. It was he who set 
  the people out upon the now-famous Trail of Tears. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some of us had previously traveled all across Tennessee, the 
  Virginias and southward through the Carolinas, and I had also asked God's forgiveness 
  for all these sins, as well as for my own, from the top of Stone Mountain in 
  Georgia. We didn't want the children to forget that the very side of the river 
  we were sitting on was stolen land also. (That episode began with the very first 
  colonists two hundred years earlier. Some reason that many of the native inhabitants 
  were just as vicious with each other before the Europeans came as the Europeans 
  were in turn to them. And while this is true in part, the atrocities were now 
  being committed in the name of Christ. They were now being committed in clear 
  violation of the very proscriptions against such things in the written word, 
  and this is clearly forbidden). I had already visited and prayed at the site 
  of Tippecanoe, so I did not need to go there again. I wanted to make the trip 
  to California in five days if that were possible, and then, after the visit 
  there, five days back in order to be in New York City for the Holy Days.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I set out across Kentucky to Louisville, and on up into <i>Indiana</i> 
  at New Albany, heading for the house of two dear friends, Frank and Sonja, who 
  lived just south of Terre Haute where I would pass the night before crossing 
  over into <i>Illinois</i> the next day--remaining ever mindful of the history 
  of this part of America, and how little trace there was of the people who first 
  inhabited this region, except in the names. When asked for a definition of a 
  modern housing development--you know the tractless wasteland of minnie mansions 
  that are springing up all over America, and the temple-malls and miles of dealerships 
  that attend them--someone said: &quot;It is where you go in and cut down all 
  the trees, and then name streets after them.&quot; The practice didn't begin 
  with the developers. It began when the national roads were opened to the West, 
  when the first settlers came into these areas driving the indigenous peoples 
  before them, and then naming states and territories after those they had driven 
  out. It is all quite evil. God hasn't forgotten it. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Our friends in Indiana had taken us on several occasions onto 
  restricted coal company areas, to see--to stand there struck with amazement 
  and deep, deep sorrow is more like it--as these massive coal drags (larger than 
  one can imagine) worked non-stop in great sweeping circles 24 hours a day, ripping 
  up the earth and leaving behind a man-made mountain of lifeless soil and a gaping 
  wound that will not heal for a thousand years. In West Virginia and other parts 
  of Appalachia they have devised an even more diabolical means at getting at 
  the coal. They are not even embarrassed to call it by its name: mountain top 
  removal. The words kept dancing through my mind: <i> And now the time has come 
  to destroy those who destroy the earth</i>. (Revelation 11:18).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Several months beforehand our friends had taken us over to 
  St. Louis to see the eye of the needle, or the Gateway to the West as it is 
  called. A great amount of the pioneering traffic westward passed through the 
  St. Louis area in the nineteenth century, and Lewis and Clark set out from there 
  on their voyage up the Missouri River searching for a land route to the Pacific 
  Ocean. Many American Indians refer to this time in history as <i>The Contact</i>. 
  For other tribes the <i>Contact</i> occured many years before when the Spanish 
  came to the center of the continent in search of gold. They left not finding 
  any the <i>precious</i> metals they had heard of. (Job, chapter 28). Those Spaniards 
  had no idea of the true (future) treasure those Kansa were guarding. (There 
  was a Divine plan afoot, one that is still unfolding...It is going to be a Great 
  Jubilee). Some Paiute historians have more aptly called it <i>the Intrusion</i>. 
  Others are more blunt and call it by its true name, <i>genocide</i>. In all 
  cases the incursion was a long relentless process of exploration, commercial 
  exploitation, military conquest and dispossession. <i>Manifest Destiny </i>was 
  underway.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> It was under Thomas Jefferson's administration that this expansion 
  beyond the Mississippi got under way. It was he who officiated the Louisiana 
  Purchase which granted to America the <i>legal</i> title of administration over 
  a land that it had absolutely no right to purchase, and, of course, France had 
  no right to sell, and who dispatched Lewis and Clark to find the Northwest passage 
  through this land. Thus it is natural to find an imposing statue of Jefferson 
  occuping the central rotundra of the museum (The Jefferson National Expansion 
  Memorial) dedicated to this era of American conquest. It is also here that the 
  tour of the museum begins. The visitor, setting out with a very subliminal attachment 
  to Jeffersonian principles, then proceeds to tour the historical exhibits that 
  fan out and lead at last back to the statue again. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The first feature at the Museum of Westward Expansion, is the 
  History Wall where one can follow in chronological order all of the main events 
  of nineteenth century American history, beginning with the Land Act of 1800 
  which divided the Northwest Territory into what would later become the individual 
  states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and and Illinois--1804, The Louisiana Territory 
  Act which gave official notice of the United States government's intention to 
  move Indians living east of the Mississippi to the west of the river. The Land 
  Act which reduced the minimum cash payment for Western lands from $2.00 to $1.64 
  per acre. 1813, General William Harrison's victory signals collapse of Indian 
  confederacy in Northwest. 1815, Treaty of Portage Des Sioux enables rapid settlement 
  of the upper and western-most part of trans-Appalachia. 1816, First Seminole 
  War ends in the defeat of the Florida Indians at the hands of Andrew Jackson. 
  1817, Alabama territory is formed, Mississippi admitted as a state--and ending 
  in 1890 with the notations: &quot;Sioux chief Sitting Bull is killed by soldiers 
  in South Dakota during U.S. Army effort to curb influence of the <i>Ghost Dance</i>, 
  a religious rite thought to be dangerous to the white population in the area; 
  Two hundred (300) unarmed Sioux are massacred by U.S. Cavalry at Wounded Knee 
  Creek on December 29.&quot; These last events signaled the end of &quot;armed&quot; 
  resistance on behalf of American Indians in this country, until the brief encounters 
  in South Dakota between the resurgent American Indian Movement and federal officials 
  in the early 1970s...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But the highlight of that visit were the mounds at Cahokia 
  which were built a thousand years earlier across the river in what is now Illinoi 
  (and then <i>mysteriously </i>abandoned, as all ancient sacred pyramid-places 
  were). One can stand on what is now called Monks Mound and see the skyline of 
  St. Louis, and the great arch. One can also look directly to the West (almost 
  beyond the frame of this picture), and see the Wood Circle, or Woodhenge, which 
  was also erected by this <i>unknown</i> people (obviously some of the ancestors 
  of the central plains Indians), who also obviously knew something of their place 
  in the center of God's great mystery--a mystery that the Europeans had long 
  forgotten. (&quot;He has lost his Instructions&quot; said Matthew King one of 
  the Lakota Wisdomkeepers), This people must have also known something of the 
  times...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">..<img src="../../UsedImages/cahokia.gif" width="488" height="375"></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">From the center of the Wood Circle the administrators of this 
  temple were able to record the passing of the seasons, the Equinoxes and Solstices, 
  and, it is believed, the phases and intercalations of the Moon. In so doing 
  they were able to align their own spiritual observances and rituals with the 
  Mind of Creation itself. The Great Wooden Circle contained spaces for forty-eight 
  poles, with one--the 49th, or central pillar--in the center. One can imagine 
  the people observing and counting off forty-eight years of seasons, returning 
  every 49th year to the central pole, and to the passing of another in the great 
  sequence of years marking the passage of Jubilees. When the full amount of Jubilees 
  transpired in the Earth (40 from the time of Christ to be exact), the world 
  would be attended by such great signs and wonders as it presently is, when the 
  old age would come to its conclusion and the New would be born. We can also 
  imagine that the priests of Cahokia had instructions to abandon this site before 
  the final ten Jubilees began to transpire (the final 10 X 49 years), so that 
  when the Ravens (the sons of Darkness) came to these shores, and to this land, 
  they would still be left in the dark as to the great historical meaning of these 
  things. Cahokia is not situated directly at the center of the country, so it 
  also seems that those who officiated here were keepers of the Great River Legend, 
  the one that would flow out of Eden again at the end of days. (Revelation 22). 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We had already offered our prayers at the summit of this mound, 
  so it was decided to leave on a more northerly route from Indiana, across Illinois 
  and Nebraska, toward the Sioux reservations in southcentral and western South 
  Dakota. (I would stay off the Interstates wherever it was possible. One should 
  not be proud of them. They are a collossal engineering and commercial metaphor 
  for what America has become: diabollically unmindful of its own precious environment, 
  its own spiritual surroundings, and--despite all of the technological and commercial 
  motion in every direction--fast asleep. Yes, this was a journey through the 
  great American Dreamscape. And I was part of the dream. I and my automobile 
  were part of the disorder. But the even greater reality--the paradox as it is--is 
  that it is only in such a place as America, and only under such historical conditions 
  as these, that the spiritual mind can fully awaken).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I did not know what I would find on my journey through the 
  reservations, or if I would even be allowed to pass through them without a reason 
  for being there, I had no idea. I also had a suspicion that many indigenous 
  peoples must look upon &quot;outsiders&quot; as myself with general disdain, 
  or, at the very least, with general disinterest. After all, what benefit has 
  such friendship with strangers proved so far? I did not want to seem like a 
  tourist, but I guess that is what I was. Sunbear, an American Indian who had 
  come over in a new-age kind of way to assist others on their journey back to 
  a whole state of human consciousness, said of outside ideas, that if they didn't 
  grow corn he wasn't interested in them. Well I had some good seed with me, some 
  good medicine, but I did not know if anyone would be interested yet, if they 
  could take any home. It is obvious to me now that I was still trying to heal 
  myself. I was still trying to get the true gold to come to fruition in myself. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That process was actually unfolding in an interesting and significant 
  way--and as a not-so-coincidental preparation for this journey as I look back 
  on it--when a man named Scott Kelly, who we met on the street corner at Times 
  Square, invited us to a sweat lodge ceremony his fellowship of friends were 
  observing that previous Fall. Mike Duff and I came early as Scott suggested, 
  in order to help set up the ceremony. We met the shaman woman who would lead 
  the observances that day, who instructed us in the ways to carry each stone 
  into the sacred circle, how to set them one on top of the other according to 
  number, and how to build the fire that would bake these stones red hot, until 
  they were ready to be brought into the sweat lodge after everyone was assembled 
  there. She taught us how to cut prayer cloths, seven colors--one for the sky 
  above, one for the earth below, one for each of the Four directions, and one 
  for the Universe which encompasses all--and how to tie them together with offerings 
  of tobacco and other herbs, to be brought into the lodge and left there as an 
  offering of gratitude and a reminder of our most deepest thoughts and earnest 
  petitions. The men in shorts (Lame Deer had something to say about this wearing 
  of shorts), the women in light cotton dresses, some with colorful ceremonial 
  symbols woven into them, entered the lodge in a clockwise direction, to meet 
  the Light that always rises from the East--women first, men last. It is the 
  way of Creation. (Lame Deer also spoke of the more proper direction for this 
  ceremony--Westward. But there is a very true reason for facing the Rising Sun 
  as well, particularly if one is observing this ceremony in the East). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The first set of burning stones were brought in, the flaps 
  were shut and all exterior light was extinguished. It was indeed like returning 
  to the womb of the Divine Mother, to be born anew. &quot;Four sessions,&quot; 
  she said. For many other reasons it was also fitting that there were only three 
  sessions that day. The first began with the appropriate songs and prayers, and 
  some teachings about the ceremony itself, and lasted about fifteen minutes. 
  It was cleansing, but not yet the ordeal it was about to become. When the second 
  set of stones was brought in, and after the lodge was closed to the outside 
  again, all attention was turned now to Momageeshick, a wonderfully gentle Ojibway 
  man who brought with him a great contentment, a faith in all things, and a lifetime 
  of songs and prayers, and stories, but mostly on this day prophecies that he 
  had learned from the elders of his people. As he spoke the heat began to rise. 
  As he continued I began to learn the meaning of the <i>sweat lodge</i>. As he 
  continued further I began to experience the <i>mysterium </i> of the lodge. 
  I was, and I imagine all of us there together were experiencing the <i>ordeal 
  </i>that begins to test one's ability to endure, not only physical but as the 
  minutes and the words wore on a very certain level of psychological discomfort 
  (well, perhaps not Momageeshick who must have been as at home in this lodge 
  as he was in these words). The lungs have inhaled the fire, the sweat is pouring 
  out, (as fear and anxiety must pour from the mind), and before long one is having 
  the inevitable, and intended ritual encounter with the idea of death itself. 
  One begins to long for just one breath of fresh air, for that light <i>out there</i> 
  that will bring that cool breath of air, if only the door would open...if only 
  someone would be the first to open it. The prophecies continued. The shaman 
  woman would know when to open it, but when? This is not only a private ordeal 
  but a communal one as well. The others were dimly present in the darkness, one 
  must draw strength from them, each from the other. But to pass this ordeal one 
  must at last recompose, listen to the words, concentrate on that light within, 
  and draw assurance and courage from within themself. I believe this happened 
  just before the flaps were opened and air poured in. Thaaank you. After a third, 
  brief session everyone agreed that the sweat was complete. There was a communal 
  circle right afterwards, in the outside air (outside of the womb), around which 
  the shaman woman passed the sacred pipe from soul to soul. (Not <i>the </i>sacred 
  pipe, but <i>a </i>sacred pipe). It was a wonderful and deeply personal experience. 
  I felt that I had passed. One could not recite the words &quot;Go the mass is 
  over&quot; yet, the meanings of that sacred ritual are yet to be fulfilled, 
  but the lodge ceremony is a very meaningful passage leading to it. It is a baptism 
  and a rebirth at the same time. Everything is connected... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">P</font><font size="+1">erhaps this is the proper place to 
  respond to a recent article in the <i>Navajo Times</i>, (March 07, 2002), entitled:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NORTHERN CHEYENNE 
    CALLS FOR PROTECTION OF SACRED CEREMONIES</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PORTLAND, Ore__Concerned over the 
    desecration of the Northern Cheyenne sun dance and sweat lodge, Bernard Red 
    Cherries said it is now more important than ever to protect the sacred for 
    future generations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Red Cherries, Northern Cheyenne 
    from Montana, is a sun dance/arrow priest and Elk Society headsman. &quot;We 
    ask the people who are abusing these ceremonies to take pity on us and leave 
    our ways to us,&quot; he said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The heart of the people lies in 
    the language and the ceremonies, that is what the Cheyenne people believe, 
    Red Cherries said. Red Cherries called on the legitimate spiritual leaders 
    of the Cheyenne and Lakota nations to meet in mid-March at Bear Butte, S.D., 
    to discuss the protection and preservation of the ancient ceremonies which 
    are now being abused...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The sweat lodge was given 
    by the Creator; we have oral history as well as ceremonial proof and testimony, 
    that it ascended from certain tribes,&quot; he said...The Plains ceremonies 
    are imitated and exploited by non-native, and at times native, New-Age shamans 
    who are self proclaimed priests or priestesses molding it to their wild agendas...I 
    have heard of sweats termed as new moon sweats and solstice sweats, somewhere 
    this nonsense must be challenged...I don't think our elders who fought so 
    hard and paid the ultimate price with their blood and lives so that we could 
    continue to carry on our ceremonies have ever heard of these types of sweats,&quot; 
    he said...&quot;We need to address this issue of abuse and attempt to quell 
    this bastardization and exploitation of our sacred ways,&quot; he said...&quot;The 
    sweat lodge, being a central part of our ceremonies, being ceremonially taught 
    and given by the ancient ones, needs to be protected...&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the considerations is whether 
    those conducting the ceremonies should be fluent in the ancient language of 
    the tribes. Also under consideration is whether leaders of the sun dance should 
    be those who have pledged a sun dance and become sun dance priests.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In deference to Bernard Red Cherries' concern for the integrity 
  of these ancient ceremonies we must first of all accede to him. We too are concerned 
  for the integrity of the sacred. Stripped of his own sense of his own mysteries, 
  the White man, hollow of heart and empty of song, seems now to be stealing rituals 
  as he stole land, to make up for a lack of his own. May I suggest, however, 
  that Red Cherries does not see the big picture...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And there are things to be considered: 
    Where are you living? What are you doing? What are your relationships? Are 
    you in right relation? Where is your water? Know your garden. It is time to

<p> <font size="+1">We agree with Red Cherries' concern for the shallow and superficial 
  way many New Age practitioners are presently observing these rituals, without 
  regard for their most serious and sacred implications, but we also see that 
  he is mistaking those who are taking these ceremonies seriously (and yes, redefining 
  them in terms of present realizations), with those who are abusing them. He 
  cannot see that a New Age is indeed in the process of being born, and that there 
  are thousands upon thousands in the earth at this present time who are rising 
  up out of every race of humankind, and out of every religious tradition, in 
  order to facilitate that process. These have come into the Earth at this time 
  to help God turn the Great Wheel of Life, out of the shadows through which it 
  is presently passing into the Light of the coming Day. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus standing in that small circle of sweat-lodge initiates 
  was not unlike being in the greater circle of those who assembled the year before 
  at the Rainbow Family Gathering in the Allegheney National Forest. These thousands 
  had come, as they have every year in July since the early 1970s, at different 
  places throughout the country, to observe <i>homecoming</i>, a (not always) 
  unimpeded opportunity to share ideas, and an annual celebration of life. They 
  come to keep the ceremony alive, to observe that day in the near future when 
  all of God's children would meet at the Center, and begin to be united in one 
  Great Circle around the Sacred Tree. They came this year, as they have each 
  year during the weeks and days leading up to the 4th of July, not to revel in 
  the &quot;American&quot; state of mind but to reflect, and to observe on that 
  day a time of fasting and silence until noon. Those who are taking the observance 
  seriously come to make a collective atonement for the sins of their own people. 
  (I pray that Red Cherries will open up the Circle of his own heart, to admit 
  all who would come to him, for instruction; and that he himself appear on the 
  day when the Great Circle is assembled in the center of this country, when all 
  of God's children meet together at the Jubilee.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was morning when I passed out of Nebraska onto the Rosebud 
  reservation in southern South Dakota. There was no one there checking papers. 
  A sign instead said, &quot;Welcome To The Land of The Sicangu Lakota Oyate The 
  Burnt Thigh Nation.&quot; At first glance one might have reasoned that beyond 
  that sign there was nothing there at all. But then one sees it. The earth is 
  there, and the sky, and one's sense of always being in the center of the vast 
  dome of heaven. It is like never leaving home uncovered. The sky is one vast 
  yarmulka, one gets to put on a new one every morning and every night. But I 
  would not get lost in liberal, or romantically religious notions here. This 
  land was a place of confinement. This people once (<i>owned </i>of course is 
  not the proper word) the entire state of South Dakota, and all the surrounding 
  states as well, from one ocean to the other. And the confinement began to show 
  as I proceeded onto the reservation. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Poor people have poor ways, someone once said. There seemed 
  to be despair and poverty everywhere. The yards were strewn with trash, old 
  cars, abandoned trailers and broken toys. I know that the light of hope burns 
  everywhere, even in the darkest places, but it seemed almost to have been put 
  out here. Perhaps the young mothers are keeping the flame, certainly many of 
  the older people, and I am sure some of the men. (Yes, of course, many people 
  are keeping it). I had terribly mixed emotions. Intentional poverty, or rather 
  intentional simplicity is good. It is essential to the soul. What a wonderful 
  place of pilgrimage this could be, a place of deep religious contemplation and 
  renewal. But all of life itself is a pilgrimage. The people here were barely 
  surviving, it was not intentional. But then again, was I allowing a false set 
  of Western material values to cloud my view of things here? No, not entirely, 
  there was squallar and desolation here. This was a beaten people. But then again, 
  I thought, it was not too much unlike the conditions in which impoverished people 
  everywhere lived, up in the hollars of Appalachia, in the inner cities and many 
  other outlying and rural areas of America. My heart reached out to poverty everywhere, 
  but most especially to poverty of mind and spirit. (I have since read <i>Lame 
  Deer Seeker of Visions</i> by John (Fire) Lame Deer and Richard Erdoes, Harvey 
  Arden's <i>Noble Red Man, Lakota Wisdom Keeper Matthew King, </i>and another 
  by Harvey Arden and Steve Wall entitled <i>Travels in a Stone Canoe, The Return 
  to the Wisdomkeepers</i>. I would make them required reading in every school). 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> There were housing projects that reminded me of what some 
  Jewish and Arab settlements in Palestine must look like (now here is a connection 
  we shall explore at another place--the one that links the present plight of 
  Palestinians in the East to the long-standing political and social conditions 
  of Native Americans in the West), perhaps it was the sparseness of the surrounding 
  landscape, but then the signs attached to the broken chain-link fences: &quot;No 
  Alcohol In The Housing Complex.&quot; This is not a particularly Jewish or Arab 
  problem. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A local FM station was playing American hit tunes in between 
  local announcements. There were lots of &quot;meetings&quot; going on it seemed. 
  Now that is a <i>liberal</i> problem I thought. Actually I always thought I 
  was one until I realized I wasn't being invited to those meetings. Liberals 
  have lots of meetings, continuously affirming their values, one to the other, 
  but never really investing themselves in them. So nothing ever changes. But 
  that would require giving themselves fully over to the wiles of government, 
  some form of government, and it is obvious what happens to liberals who go in 
  that direction. They get eaten up. They trade a lot for a little. They lose 
  their souls. They become what they are trying to change. It even seems that 
  up until recently all of God's wars against America have erupted during so-called 
  <i>Liberal</i> regimes. Liberals are not averse to killing and warfare, they 
  just have different, well, more <i>liberal</i> and <i>democratic</i> reasons 
  for waging it. They speak of peace, but they mean war. They speak of justice, 
  but they do not mean that either. (But for some more obvious reasons God has 
  saved those rich and powerful religious and conservative-nationalists for last. 
  They are sincere in all of their evil ways). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The middle path is hard, it is the true path, it seems impractical, 
  it demands that one remain separate from insincerity in all of its forms, from 
  the <i>irreligious</i> ways of liberals and the <i>religious</i> ways of conservatives 
  at the same time. It means remaining separate from the deceptions of government 
  (every form of government) and its violent ways, even if it means foregoing 
  some of the benefits that only government can bring. It leaves one alone with 
  God, outside of the political order, sharing in the poverty and despair, and 
  in prayer for the day when the true righteous order would appear. It certainly 
  transcends the local politics of the reservation, which tends, it is apparent, 
  to continuous, and perhaps at times even well-meaning, levels of dissention 
  and dispute. It has all led to the present sorry state of affairs among Native 
  Americans. (We need not mention here the unholy condition White America is in). 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was surprised to find the St. Francis Catholic Mission there 
  on the reservation. Was this a papal outpost? Or were Francis and Clare to be 
  found laboring here still among God's children despite the dictates of Rome 
  and all of its past cruelties? Was this where the light was being tended? I 
  offered my prayers inside the church, and then looked around for someone to 
  talk to. What would we talk about? Catholics do not like to talk about transcendent 
  matters. (They believe that Rome is the steward of such things). I never had 
  a Catholic priest or nun stop and talk with me before. Oh there I was letting 
  all of my own religious prejudices get in my own way. The office was locked. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was surprised to see just how many small Christian missions 
  there were on the reservations. There are small fellowships and meeting houses 
  everywhere. Does anyone attend them? There are crosses on the roadsides (some 
  of them in memory of fatalities), almost all of them decorated with flowers 
  and prayer streamers. Everything seems so dislocated. Leaving the Rosebud, turning 
  west on Rt. 18, toward Pine Ridge, one passes miles of abandoned homesteads, 
  occasional livestock, more poverty, Vetal, a virtual ghost town. Two women on 
  a more traditional Native American radio station were discussing the cause and 
  effect of all these things--unemployment and poverty, alcoholism, neglect and 
  abuse--on family life. One understands these issues. They are not confined to 
  Native Americans. They touch the oppressed everywhere. And then all of a sudden 
  fields of sunflowers growing like corn. You look to see if they are following 
  the sun as it is said they do... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And then there along this lonely road, near a little place 
  named Batesland, there was what could only have been a Sun Dance Circle. I got 
  out and stared at it from the road. I didn't know if I was allowed to enter 
  others' sacred places without permission. It is the same way with the poor. 
  You can not enter their hearts without permission, and that can only come from 
  God. One must ask God to make a way. I took a photo, and wished that I could 
  someday be invited to an authentic Sundance. Matthew King, a Lakota wise man, 
  said that he was sorry for the White Man. &quot;He's got no death song...He 
  is always trying to borrow or steal other's.&quot; I have a song. I know that 
  I am part of the Great Sundance but I would like to be invited someday to this 
  one also. Many of us would. (Many Europeans--the white man--have given their 
  lives for spiritual things and for true justice). We have been learning the 
  words, you don't have to be able to pronounce them. (I learned on a subsequent 
  trip through this territory that this particular circle, though it is ceremonial 
  in its construction, is not a Sundance Circle. In order to be so it would have 
  a Sacred Tree or pole in the center). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I passed the road leading 7 miles north to Wounded Knee to 
  visit the town of Pine Ridge first. (On the way one notices that American Indians 
  do not plant lawns around their houses. Every house is surrounded by bare earth. 
  It could be the poverty but one senses that it could be in honor of the Earth 
  itself--Herself. Neither is one attended by all the noise and fumes, nor the 
  expense that comes with maintaining lawns). It does not take very long after 
  arriving at the center of this very busy little town to sense something there, 
  an unseen tension. You stand there wondering what it is, and soon you realize 
  that it has something to do with authority. The heavy weight of the Pine Ridge 
  Indian Agency, and its invisible overlord, the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, 
  are felt everywhere. (One did not have to read any books on the subject to sense 
  it). Without approving of armed resistence anywhere, for any reason, for so 
  many higher reasons that are plain to those who understand them, one must still 
  be pulled, philosophically and sentimentally, to the side of the traditionalists 
  of the American Indian Movement in their historic conflict with the American 
  governement. (<i>Justice shalt thou perform</i>). And this would include their 
  ongoing conflict with those who represent the authority of American government 
  among the Indian peoples--those Indian agencies who are funded ostensibly for 
  almost the same reasons that towns and municipalities and police departments 
  all throughout the country are, but covertly in these cases to keep a two-hundred 
  year-old political lid on things and the White man's rule in place. This, of 
  course, will be impossible when the spiritual lid comes off, and all the doors 
  to the hidden world are opened. It will be a Jubilee. The only ones with guns 
  then, the only criminals then, will be the American government and its agents. 
  It could be a Jubilee for them too, if they would only take off those uniforms, 
  throw away those badges, and put down those guns and observe it. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As with almost all other Native American historical places, 
  the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, and the immediately surrounding 
  area where the standoff between Indian activists and the Federal government 
  took place in 1973, is barren of any other attractions. You can not buy a coke 
  or a hamburger there, and one could miss it passing by. It stands there alone, 
  unimproved, and unattended by any except an unofficial handful of artists and 
  craftspeople. Next to it are the ruins of a church, where part of the events 
  of 1973 unfolded. There is a great respect for Time among American Indians. 
  They do not fight with it, or try to improve on it. They allow it to have its 
  way. There is a fading sign there which tells the story of Bigfoot and his followers 
  who were all murdered there by the U. S. Army after returning from a long ordeal 
  of resistence, of cold and hunger. And of Red Cloud and Sitting Bull, and of 
  Crazy Horse, and of others who had placed a certain faith in the newly returned 
  Ghost Dance ritual, and in the belief that if the people performed the Dance 
  with a pure heart, returning to the old ways, that the Great Spirit would rise 
  up and drive the White Man from these sacred lands, and perhaps from the entire 
  continent itself. It was a great Hope, born of great tragic and historical circumstances 
  that had grown beyond the people's ability to control, or even understand. There 
  was also a great amount of Christian mysticism involved in this Dance. This 
  was a Holy Ghost Dance. It was not a mistake, it was part of the great prophetic 
  pattern. <i>The Mystery of Iniquity </i> was not complete yet. If the Ancient 
  One did not go on and allow the 20th century to unfold as it has we would not 
  have gotten to see evil in its most splendid and most powerful form as we see 
  it today.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The hardscrabble path leading up the hill to the cemetary and 
  the now-famous brick-and-wrought iron arch, is bare earth. The simple memorial 
  and the other graves to be found there share the site with several small trees 
  and such small patches of grass as can find a way to grow there. (On the subsequent 
  trip through this land that I mentioned, we met a young man named War Lance 
  Broken Rope. He was on his way to Rapid City and caught a ride with us. When 
  we stopped to visit the cemetary again Wahokiza, as he was also called, went 
  on up to the top of the hill where I found him clearing and tending a small 
  overgrown gravesite--of his two-year old little sister who had died several 
  years earlier. He sadly mentioned that she was one of the last ones to be buried 
  on this hill--an honour, he said, but one in which his mother could not bring 
  herself to share. She was still brokenhearted over the death of her little daughter 
  and could not yet find the strength to visit here. We left this man at his mother's 
  house in Rapid City with a promise to write and send a copy of some of the photos 
  that our friend Sirin had taken along the way). I had come specifically to this 
  place (on the first occasion) to pray, to ask forgiveness. There was a connection 
  between this place and the barren, almost forgotten state of my own soul. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had been studying the history of the Ghost Dance Movement 
  for several months prior, and before reaching California had planned to find 
  my way over to the Paiute reservation in Nevada where it began. One should always 
  try to complete every circle, and connect every beginning to its ends. Maia 
  said that I should not complete this journey without also taking a pilgrimage 
  to the sacred mountain on the other side of Rapid City near Sturgis, South Dakota.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The trip across the Badlands was kind of perplexing. Much of 
  the natural landscape resembled exactly what so many environmentalists in other 
  places were fighting to prevent, the effects of bad reclamation. This whole 
  area looked as if it had also been stripped, perhaps thousands of years ago 
  and then left to itself, without the means to heal itself. This was a subject 
  to pray about. What is the difference between God's good handiwork and man's 
  evil deeds, if they both achieve the same results? But then, isn't this like 
  asking a great artist why he or she left a part of their painting undone? And 
  then going ahead and trying to undo the rest of the painting in the artist's 
  place, when we thought the artist wasn't looking? Those who strip mine the earth 
  for profit are ripping up farmlands and forests, habitable eco-systems and esthetic 
  landscapes. Does anyone think that the artist is not going to return to Their 
  own studio and see what the bad children have done? This particular child stopped 
  and took a cool bath in a river that crossed Rt.44 between the reservation and 
  Rabo City. And I thanked and praised the Great Artist for painting it there.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I passed by Rushmore intentionally, with a heart for the mountain 
  itself and all the stones and surrounding hills, but with great sorrow for what 
  was done there, for how the place was descerated with images of violent men, 
  conquerors and land stealers. (Great White Chiefs some have called them. Devils 
  is the word the sacred Scripture uses to describes them). There is another set 
  of images like it, blasted into the side of Stone Mountain, Georgia. Even the 
  image of Crazy Horse being carved into another rockface in the Black Hills is 
  a desecration. I know for certain that he would not have approved of it. (Lame 
  Deer and Erdoes have said exactly the same in their chapter on this subject). 
  The son of one of Rushmore's chief sculptors is presently determined to erect 
  a 36-foot high equestrian statue of Don Juan de Onate, one the Spain's cruellest 
  conquistadores, in the center of El Paso, Texas. This son of Spanish <i>nobles</i> 
  left a trail of tortured and murdered (disciplined) Indians behind him as he 
  followed the <i>Camino Real</i>, or Royal Road, out of Mexico into the southwest 
  over 400 years ago. &quot;To Mr. Houser (the sculpter), comments about Indian 
  butchers sound like a lot of new-age babble. 'If monuments were erected only 
  to honor saints', he said, 'there would be no monuments to Jefferson or Lincoln. 
  There would be no Mount Rushmore or Vietnam Memorial, (Now that is true)...Whether 
  they like it or not...we are going to give El Paso a gorgeous statue.'&quot; 
  If I were the American people I would be paying a lot of attention to the words 
  in Leviticus 26. I would take those words serious. I would believe God meant 
  them. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was late in the afternoon when I arrived at Bear Butte. 
  I had no idea of how revered the site was until I began my own ascent to the 
  summit. The <i>people</i> called it <i>Mato Paha</i>, the Bear Mountain. It 
  was believed by the elders that this was one of the places in the world where 
  Heaven and Earth spoke to one another. There was a great assembly of tribal 
  leaders here in 1857. They had come from every direction to learn what to do 
  about the White Man's entry into the land. Thousands upon thousands, including 
  whites, have come to the Mountain since then, seeking answers, offering thanks, 
  some just curious. On that second trip through here that I mentioned, the young 
  man who rode with us up to Rapid City said, &quot;Now don't forget to see her.&quot; 
  &quot;Who?&quot; we asked. &quot;The woman giving birth,&quot; he said. &quot;Earth

<p><font size="+1">As it happened I was alone on the mountain this day. There 
  was a family camped in a tepee below at the base. Setting out, one is immediately 
  reminded of all those who have been there before them. Almost every tree and 
  shrub along the path is ribboned with streamers and pouches. One reaches out 
  to touch them, to connect, to be part of the collective experience of this mountain. 
  The path winds upwards, back and forth, until at last one is near the summit. 
  It is almost two miles to the top. Reaching it, among the trees and the rocks, 
  one finds more streamers, embedded staffs, tent poles, blankets, stone circles, 
  gifts and offerings. The sky to day is clear, one can see far off in all directions. 
  The breeze is gentle, it is warm. It is a perfect day for a conversation. The

<p><font size="+1">I woke up the next morning in Wyoming. Like the Badlands this 
  area of the state was treeless and barren in all directions. But what was it 
  about this place? That feeling was back. Only now there were images from the 
  movie <i>Spartacus</i> flashing through my mind--of conditions that existed 
  in the distant provinces under the rule of Rome. Something was similar here. 
  What were these people doing here? Why would anyone want to come here to live? 
  To this tractless place? To spend their life working, for who? for what? Wasn't 
  this the home state of Dick Cheney? one of the two reigning American Caesars? 
  Then it hit me. This was a slave colony, a labor camp. No, there wasn't anyone 
  wearing chains, at least not the kind you could see. Everyone was free to come 
  and go--each had their own pickup truck--but it was certain that very few would 
  wander too far from their job. That was it! They were here for the money. They 
  were mesmerized by the thought of money and for the purely superficial things 
  that money can buy. No, it was bigger than that, bigger than each of these subject 
  workers could possibly realize. They were only being kept content with money 
  and things. But it was really about coal and oil, it was about energy, about 
  the exploitation of the natural world. It was about power, Teapot Domes, now 
  Enron, military contracts, war and global domination. These men had come into 
  these territories as conquerors, or so it seemed, but they were slaves in fact 
  to their own ambitions, and the most ruthless among them have risen to the top.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Rt. 59 to Casper; Rts. 220 and 287 passed <i>Independence</i> 
  Rock toward Lander, following the Pioneer Trail. Many lives were lost crossing 
  this barren land on the way to the good life in Oregon and California. Rt. 28 
  to Rock Springs, and I-80 to Salt Lake City. The Mormons came through here on 
  their way to Utah. Now this is an entire story in itself, and one should read 
  it from every angle: from the perspectives of those who uphold Mormon beliefs, 
  and from those who view it as a, or perhaps, <i>the</i> great American Cult. 
  Atlantis and the Western Eden, true Zion, hidden treasures, Rosicrucian tablets, 
  lost tribes, and the mysteries of Islam, all reimagined and reforged, as it 
  were, with the stamp of the American Manifest Destiny. Joeph Smith even entertained 
  notions of becoming a candidate for the presidency of the United States (the 
  great American Caliph), in order to extend his theocratic vision across the 
  whole continent. Objective truth must be able to stand against every criticism. 
  The Mormon story shall in fact tell itself, in all of its historical as well 
  as psychological details, as the mysteries of God are revealed in our time. 
  This much is plain to see: driving through Salt Lake City one immediately notices 
  that the Mormon Temple sits lower than the State Capital and not the other way 
  around. Ba'al resides there, as he does in Washington, D.C. I did not stop there 
  but went on into Nevada. I was in search of the prophet Wovoka, and the origins 
  of the modern Ghost Dance movement. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I reached the town of Schurz, Nevada, the seat of the Walker 
  River Paiute Reservation, sometime around noon the next day, and asked around 
  for the tribal offices. I met Victor Williams and told him of my interest in 
  Wovoka. He showed me to the tribal council office where the head of the council 
  provided me with a history of the Paiutes written by one of the elders of the 
  tribe. I thanked him and immediately found a place to read the book, outside 
  under the shade of a tree. &quot;I was afraid you had left,&quot; Victor Williams 
  said, finding me there. &quot;Would you like to visit Wovoka's gravesite?&quot; 
  he asked. &quot;Would I!&quot; Victor took me down several back streets to the 
  town cemetery. &quot;He is in here somewhere,&quot; Victor said, as he started 
  up and down the lines of graves looking for him. I was surprised to notice the 
  patriotic symbols, flags and stones engraved with the military records of some 
  who were buried there. And then I thought of all the attention that was recently 
  being paid to the Navaho &quot;code talkers&quot; who served in the Second World 
  War. I understood the complexities of it all, and knew that contentment and 
  acceptance of one's situation in life is a sign of great godliness, but still 
  wondered how a people, as oppressed and displaced as Native Americans were, 
  and are, could be induced at the same time to fight and kill for those who have 
  conquered and oppressed them. It is an age-old story, and a very powerful oppression. 
  And I suppose that some felt more oppressed than others. The Navahos, unlike 
  others, were at least confined to parts of their own ancestral lands. The Walker 
  River council likewise speaks in glowing terms of its local enviornmental training 
  program, funded through the grants it receives from the Indian Environmental 
  General Assistance Program, an arm of FEMA, all of which has been made necessary 
  as a result of the conditions described on a Paiute website as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Walker River Paiute Tribe is 
    impacted by a full-range of environmental issues, including contamination 
    related to military and mining activities...Walker River Reservation is located 
    between two major Department of Defense (DOD) installations and a number of 
    mining operations. On a daily basis trucks and rail transport live military 
    ordanance and chemical weaponry through the reservation. Also gold and copper 
    mining operations transport cyanide and other chemicals used for processing 
    through the reservation...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">&quot;Here he is,&quot; Victor shouted from several rows away. 
  One could see that Wovoka's gravesite was being visited on a regular basis. 
  There were many offerings placed around the stone. The idea must still be alive 
  in the hopes of at least some of the people. The stone said: </font></p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I had purchased a small drum at Wounded Knee and placed it 
  on the gravestone. &quot;Would it be disrespectful to take a photograph?&quot; 
  I asked. Victor thought for a moment, &quot;I don't think so&quot; he said. 
  &quot;In any case, I am on the tribal council. You have asked my permission. 
  So I say, Go ahead.&quot; On our little trip back to town Victor told me of 
  the work he is doing there among the young people, and of the concerns he has 
  for their future. He has been away to school, and has returned. He and his wife 
  have a new child.</font></p>

  Redwood forests. What can be said about them? these tallest of all living things? 
  They are so humbling (one wants to kneel in their presence)...and yet so vulnerable.

  not for the fact that these last several centuries, and particularly the 20th 
  century, have been recorded from every possible perspective, those who are alive 
  in the future would hardly believe it all, how close humanity actually came 
  to destroying himself and the planet he lives on--if the Divine Presence did 
  not rise up and stop him that is. Their's will be a world wholly transformed, 
  a natural Paradise. As it is they will read the books and see the films (or 
  whatever form the printed and visual media has assumed in those times), and 
  be unbelievably amazed at what they are seeing. But because of the work that 
  is being done in our time they will realize the potential for evil that also 
  exists in themselves, without having to experience it for themselves as we in 
  our time have had to, and be ever on guard against it. They will be on guard 
  against the speeches and the philosophies that have brought those who are presently 
  in charge of the world to power. And they will regard with great historic reverence, 
  not only the Most Ancient One but all the ancient ones who stood bold in these 
  times against the destroyers. Of course it was never God's intention to let 
  the destroyers get beyond the present point in time. &quot;Four knocks, no more.&quot;

<p><font size="+1">The ten thousand windmills one meets on the way out of southern 
  California into Arizona (the Windmills of <i>Tehachapi</i>), all of them churning 
  away in the prevailing breeze, are all part of the future. It is a place of 
  thanks. One feels a touch of assurance, even pride (well, not pride, but joy), 
  to be part of what man is becoming--not what he is yet, but what he is becoming. 
  He still takes much, much more than he gives, destroys more than he preserves, 
  and the wrong people are still in charge of those windmills. He is still trying 
  to air-condition and consume his way into the future. Nature (God) will alter 
  that arrangement for him. (The New Mother Earth Catalogue will be standard reading 
  in every <i>shtetle</i>, every Hobbit village and homestead). If one catches

  tourists will no longer be flying airplanes and helicopters down into this sacred 
  place. (On our most recent trip through Grand Canyon National Monument, on our 
  way back to New York, we, Tim, Chris and I, found ourselves at a remote place 
  along the south rim as night was falling over the canyon. We stayed there in 
  meditation until the sun disappeared in the West, and all was dark. &quot;Can

  it is like a CNN war zone. It is a war zone--a war against the True Light. (Men

    a group of up to 60 officers representing the Hopi Tribal government, the 
    Hopi Tribe's Land Team, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Navajo County 
    Sheriff's Dept., invaded the ceremonial Sundance site at Camp Anna Mae, a 
    home to traditional Dineh resisters who have vowed to remain on their ancestral 
    homelands despite continuous threats by Hopi and federal governments of forced 
    eviction and relocation. This ceremonial ground is the site of daily worship 
    for traditional families who live at Big Mountain...as well as a continuous 
    ceremony dedicated to healing of the earth and towards the creation of life 
    known as the Sundance. The officers who came to invade the village arrived 
    armed with a bulldozer, a backhoe, chainsaws, and other equipment of destruction, 
    as well as live weapons and several ambulances (apparently the officers expected 
    bloodshed). Within several hours the entire ceremonial site had been bulldozed, 
    including all of the sweat lodges. The sacred Sundance Tree of Life, including 
    its eagle feathers and prayer offerings was cut down and shredded...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Hopi Tribal government, working 
    in cooperation with the BIA and the federal government, simply wish to make

    only wreak environmental destruction, they would destroy an entire way of 
    life, indeed an entire people. The Dineh at Big Mountain are fighting for

<p><font size="+1">I woke up as the Navajo park ranger was opening the gate to 
  the Four Corners Monument. There were a few others also there already, waiting 
  to visit. There was no charge to enter until 8.30 when the park officially opened 
  for the day. Like almost all other Native American places this was a very unofficial 
  and informal place to visit. It is a man made site, but a mandala nevertheless. 
  It is the only place in the United States where four states meet together at 
  right angles. One should stop at every labyrinth and at every mandala they come 
  to, each is a center, each is a sacred place to offer prayers. (The mandala 
  is the point at the center which expands, as one's consciousness expands, to 
  form a great circle in which the prayerful and receptive soul can now include 
  the entire Universe and every living thing in it). </font></p>

  the Four Corners Monument. (Friendly and insightful conversation seems to be

<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Navajo 
    history, they were first instructed in the art of sandpainting by the Holy 
    Ones, divine beings of tremendous power and importance never seen by human 
    eyes. The Holy Ones became known through instructions they relayed to spirits, 
    such as the Wind people, who passed on knowledge of the ceremonial songs to 
    the ancient Navajos. Among the sacred knowledge given to the first apprentices 
    during Seven days and Seven nights of purification and instruction were songs, 
    prayers, medicine objects, plants with protective and curative powers and 
    sandpaintings...The apprentices were told that they must do their own sandpaintings 
    with sand on Mother Earth, a stipulation to prevent the knowledge from being 
    hoarded and to ensure that anyone with the necessary ability and patience 
    could learn them. As the Holy Ones told them:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="center"><i>We will not give you this picture. Men are not as good 
        as we; They might quarrel over a picture and tear it, and that would bring 
        misfortune.</i></p>
      <p align="center"><i>The black cloud would not come again, and the rain 
        would not fall. The corn would not grow.</i></p>
      <p align="center"><i>But you may paint it on the ground, with the colors 
        of the earth.</i></p>

<p align="center"><i><font size="2">A Guide to Navajo Sandpaintings, </font></i><font size="2">by 
  Mark Bahti with Eugene Baatsoslanii Joe</font>. </p>
<p><font size="+1">I mention the religious articles along with Butler's giving 
  nature because of something I have learned about such articles, and because 
  of a story I will relate shortly. C. J. Butler lowered the price of the sand 
  painting so that I could purchase it with the money I had in my pocket. It was 
  a side-by-side image of Sky-father and Earth-mother (or their representatives 
  on earth), with a corn stalk representing the central pillar of the Tree of 
  Life between them. There were other symbols imbedded in the painting which several 
  books on the subject of such sand paintings describe. In one of these books 
  is mention of the fact that most native sandpainters leave out or skew certain 
  symbols when the paintings are to be sold to outsiders, so that those who purchase 
  them cannot unwittingly or otherwise tap into the power that is inherent in 
  the original paintings themselves. Such beliefs stem directly from the universal 
  and mystical realization that the complex symbolism inherent in the Tree of 
  Life, when seen and understood in all of its composite interrelatedness, does 
  indeed yield to those who are one with it a certain measure of power (no, a 
  great measure of power), which one could conceivably use for either good or 
  evil. This is why Heaven has withheld and skewed certain elements of the Great 
  Mystery from the eyes of the sons of Darkness, so that they could not exercise 
  the true power that comes only to those who have lived by faith in the earth, 
  and who have waited on the Spirit to reveal Her own mysteries to those whom 
  She will, in Her own proper time. All of which leads to the following story:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Before setting out on our most recent journey across the country, 
  Elizabeth Lakin, a lady who lives in the Sonoma County area north of San Francisco, 
  asked me to try to purchase a ceremonial rattle somewhere along the way for 
  her, which she planned to use in her own healing rituals. Elizabeth Lakan lives 
  in a tiny one room hut on the edge of a redwood forest, with no indoor facilities. 
  She is a healer, a body worker and a New Age shaman practitioner who is learning 
  her craft, along with the use of prayers and songs, and natural essences and 
  herbs to assist her in her spiritual work. She combines various ayurvedic and 
  Native American methods of healing, which many in the medical community, of 
  course, view with great suspicion and disdain. Though these are emerging (or 
  reemerging) methods of healing, which have yet to prove themselves to the Western 
  world at large (because of its own preoccupation with material and physical 
  things), the Spirit must surely approve of them because She rewarded Elizabeth's 
  faith and blessed her in a very serious and meaningful way:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was looking everywhere along the way from New York to San 
  Francisco for one of these rattles but could not find one. In the meantime Bernard, 
  who, along with his wife, Sirin, was also making the trip, kept reminding me 
  what a foolish pursuit I was on (a fool's errend). How could one purchase a 
  rattle in an Indian craft shop, he kept saying, and then imagine that it could 
  contain even the least amount of magic or power in it to heal anything or anyone? 
  It would be nothing but a toy he said, a hollow one at that without a song in 
  it, one mass-produced for the likes of cultural tourists who have not one sense 
  of Native American healing practices, much less of the mysteries of nature that 
  underlie them. But what else could I do? I asked. Elizabeth asked me to do this 
  favor for her. Perhaps she could use it for twenty years or so, I reasoned, 
  even if it was a toy, and have all of her own magic put into it before she was 
  ever called upon to do any serious healing with it...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">L</font><font size="+1">eaving Cortez, Colorado, early in the 
  morning, on our way west on Rt.160 toward Four Corners, we saw a Native American 
  man walking along the road. I asked Bernard and Sirin if they minded if I offered 
  him a ride. Of course they didn't mind, they are both loving radical people 
  themselves and could not imagine passing someone with such a long way to go 
  without picking them up. It's the way of all God's children. He said that his 
  name was John Willie Jr., and that he lived with his father on the road that 
  leads off of Rt.160 toward Shiprock, New Mexico, just over the state line...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/RoadToShiprock.gif" width="442" height="300"></p>
  <p align="center">The road to Shiprock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> We told him that instead of dropping him off at the fork we 
  would take him all the way to his house. It was not that far out of the way. 
  As we approached what appeared to be his very impoverished house, along what 
  appeared to be a very desolate and impoverished stretch of the road (no electricity 
  or plumbing, an old shed out back), his father came to the door to see who was 
  pulling up. As we got out of the car John told us that his father was a songsinger. 
  He kept the old ways. I was beginning to sense what God was doing here. A feeling 
  of wonderment and awe ran through me. &quot;Do you think that he might have 
  a ceremonial rattle to sell?&quot; I asked. &quot;Maybe,&quot; the son replied. 
  As we stood in the living room with the father the son appeared with a beautifully 
  handcrafted rattle that he had made for ceremonial use, and perhaps to sell. 
  &quot;How much?&quot; the father asked. (Horesetrading is still the way Native 
  Americans deal with White people). I had sixty dollars in my pocket. He accepted. 
  I asked the son to tell his father who spoke little English, that we were purchasing 
  this rattle to bring it to a healing woman in California. With that the father 
  disappeared into his room and came out with a beaded hawk feather. &quot;My 
  father is going to bless you,&quot; John Willie said. The son himself sang a 
  song into the rattle while the old medicine man placed some sweet grass on the 
  woodstove and began his song ceremony. He intoned the Sky above, the Earth below, 
  He prayed to the Spirit in all Four directions and then touched each of us with 
  the sacred feather smudging us with the holy smoke from foot to head. He told 
  me to pray, which I did, following his directions, but adding a prayer to the 
  Center. He accepted my prayers and concluded his blessings.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeNavajos.gif" width="294" height="407"></p>
  <p align="center">&quot;Are you Navajo?&quot; the father asked Sirin. &quot;No, 
    I am from Thailand,&quot; she laughed.<b> </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">On our way to the car the old father took another feather and 
  blessed the car and our travels. He gave us the beaded feather with the rattle, 
  which we brought to Elizabeth. We found the second feather on the seat of the 
  car. &quot;Now this rattle has power in it,&quot; Bernard said as we made our 
  way toward Four Corners. Tim, Chris and I returned this same way with a gift 
  of organic tobacco and some heirloom seeds that Elizabeth had preserved, along 
  with some other small gifts of thanks that she had packed in a box. The old 
  medicine man blessed each of us again, as we made our way East this time, and 
  back to New York in time for Passover. &quot;Come back and visit me,&quot; he 
  said. I told him that I would try to return with some children the next time. 
  He seemed to suggest that we come before May. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Oh, that road leading in to the ruins at Chaco Canyon in New 
  Mexico. It is sixteen miles of washboard. The front-end almost fell out of the 
  car. (I know, I know). I left a note asking the people who scrape this road 
  to please pick up the bulldozer blade. (I really meant, Please take the bulldozer 
  home and park it, or sell it for scrap). The trip out there is wholly worth 
  it. Chaco Canyon, like every other sacred site on earth, like every individual 
  soul who walks the planet, is the center of the Solar System. (We must let Anna 
  Sofaer, and others explain all of the technical, archaeological and astronomical 
  details. I shall add here what I sense about it all):</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This people not only had a sense of their own place at the 
  center of their own universe, as did the people at Cahokia, but it seems they 
  were somehow informed (perhaps only archetypically some will reason) about the 
  great Solar Mystery of Zion itself...</font></p>

  and Winter solstices, leaving no shadow at the stroke of noon on those days), 
  and east and west with the Spring and Fall equinoxes. A rock carving found on 
  a nearby mesa wall corroborates this finding. This placed those who came here 
  to observe the mysteries, and especially at these particular times in the year--whether 
  they knew the greater historical significance of these things or not--at the 
  center of them. And let's for the moment assume they did know something of it 
  all. For just as the Spirit abandoned the City of David (the prototype of all 
  such mysteries), and went into exile westward with all of Her children, so those 
  who built and officiated at this sacred place also seem to have had instructions 
  to abandon it, which they did (and almost at the same time Cahokia and other 
  like-places were abandoned). Yes, there was a Great Mystery abroad in the Earth, 
  and a great part of it was being hidden and preserved on this continent, long 
  before the Europeans returned to it in force.</font></p>

  (It is very easy to find yourself thankful for bad things, like a <i>good</i> 
  road. Actually we must thank God for all things. The age of the internal combustion 
  engine, and the automobile itself, and all of these smooth concrete and asphalt 
  roads, will pass. It will pass as humanity itself passes out of this present 
  Darkness into the Light of the age-to-come). I was now on my way to Lebanon, 
  Kansas, the geographical center of the lower 48 states. This is a very fitting 
  name for a place that will have as much to do with the unfolding of God's plan 
  as this place will in the near future. It is the center of the nation, the navel, 
  just as Goshen was the center of Egypt. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Passing <i>over</i> Texas into the panhandle of Oklahoma, I 
  came to Boise City where a very nice lady allowed me to take a free shower at 
  a local truckstop, without the required purchase of diesel fuel. I entered Kansas 
  at Elkhart, passed the cattle stockyards at Moscow, the grain silos at Sublette, 
  and a large roadside sign at Montezuma that said &quot;Pray for God's mercy, 
  Pray, Pray, Pray.&quot; I made an inquisitive stop at I. S. Dinsmoor's Garden 
  of Eden. He must have been quite an eccentric, but in the greater cosmological 
  scheme of things he wasn't that far off. The Solomon River was on the way, as 
  is the Saline River and Paradise Creek. There are hundreds of square miles of 
  open space out here, corn as far as the eye can see. <i>First the blade, then 
  the ear, and then the full corn in the ear. </i>Here it is:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">There is a lot of numerical symbolism in this signpost. This 
  is the temporary center. There is a monument to the right, a small pyramidal 
  structure with a flag pole jutting out of it. There is a small chapel in the 
  background, and behind it an empty building, and all around are miles and miles 
  of open fields. Someone recently planted a small Oak Tree there for all to visit 
  in years to come. I mentioned to a group of men sitting around a stove at the 
  local service station in Lebanon, that this place in Kansas could soon become 
  the center of the Universe, as God begins to deliver Their children out of America 
  in the same way as They delivered them out of Egypt in ancient times. (Joel 
  2:15-32). &quot;I don't think we're ready for that,&quot; one of the men amusingly 
  responded. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">At the 30th anniversary of the Woodstock Festival, held at 
  Yasgur's farm in Bethel, New York, in 1999 (A Day In The Garden as it was called), 
  the folksinger, Melanie, said to everyone assembled there, that she was saddened 
  to see how the very idea of Woodstock itself was being capitalized on. She spoke 
  of those who own the Woodstock name, and of those who now own the original hillside 
  where the event itself took place. She spoke of those who actually imagine they 
  could get away with charging people money to experience something that God Themselves 
  brought together. &quot;The only reason I am here today,&quot; she told the 
  people, &quot;is because you are here. But I will not come back here again. 
  Woodstock was a <i>happening</i>, an <i>event</i>, a <i>sacred thing</i>, and 
  wherever it happens again that's where I will meet you.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This is the inside of the little chapel. (Of course the flag 
  will have to go). Many people must have sat here and prayed for the nation. 
  I sat here and prayed for the true Spiritual Nation, the one that is still laboring 
  to be born. Before the flag is taken down and passed in mourning from hand to 
  hand, before being reverently buried (as a gesture of honor to History itself, 
  and to the Lord of History Themselves, and as a prelude to the higher meaning 
  of the words at Deuteronomy 26), each soul will take note of the shape itself, 
  and of the words that say: </font></p>

  <p><b>Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto 
    him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, AND THOU ART AS A WHALE IN 
    THE SEAS: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters 
    with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.</b></p>
  <p><b>Thus saith the Lord God; I will therefore spread out my net over thee 
    with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.</b></p>
  <p><b>Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the 
    open field, and will cause all the fowls of heaven to remain upon thee, and 
    I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</b></p>

<p><font size="+1">I left here, visited another night in Indiana, and returned 
  home to West Virginia. I spent night of September 10th at my own sacred place, 
  in front of my own Sacred Tree. When morning came the world had changed. </font></p>
