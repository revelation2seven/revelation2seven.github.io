<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">NEW YORK, March 
    12, 2000...For almost two millennia, the prevailing Catholic sentiment was 
    that Jews were responsible for the death of Christ and that Jewish suffering 
    was punishment for the crime, Rabbi Michael A. Signer...told the conference. 
    Jews were to be protected only to remind Christians of Jewish sinfulness and 
    the truth of the Christian faith. Some Christian leaders, like Pope Alexander 
    II (1061-1073), objected to outright attacks on Jews. Few protested their 
    humiliation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Among the chief 
    targets of the Inquisition were Marranos, converted Jews who were suspected 
    of practicing Judaism. They were subject to torture and execution. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
    Associated Press</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">.

  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Pope 
    John Paul II today will make a sweeping confession of the sins of Catholics 
    from antiquity to modern evils, Vatican officials said last week.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The 
    pontiff will make the plea for pardon--unprecedented in the church's history, 
    the Vatican said...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The 
    Vatican released a lengthy document Tuesday analyzing the theological underpinnings 
    of the gesture. &quot;Memory and Reconciliation: the Church and the Faults 
    of the Past,&quot; written by an international panel of theologians at the 
    Vatican's request, calls the pope's commitment &quot;an act of courage and 
    humility.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">But 
    the document acknowledges that the &quot;simple admission of faults&quot; 
    might look like acquiescence in the face of accusations made by those prejudicially 
    hostile to the Church.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The 
    document lists faults the pope will address, including wars of religion; abuses 
    during the Crusades; the coercion of the Inquisition; disrespect for cultures 
    and faiths in the course of evangelization; affronts to women, races and ethnic 
    groups; and abuses of the rights of individuals.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">On 
    the &quot;tormented&quot; 2000-year history of Christian-Jewish relations,it 
    says, &quot;The hostility of diffidence of numerous Christians toward Jews 
    in the course of time is a sad historical fact and is the cause of profound 
    remorse for Christians.</font></p>
