      <p><i><font size="+1">For I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them 
        in the day that I brought them out of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings 
        and sacrifices.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">But this thing I commanded them, saying obey My Voice, 
        and I will be your God and you will be my people, and walk in all the 
        ways that I have commanded thee that it may be well with thee...</font></i><font size="+1">(Jeremiah 
        7:22,23).</font></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood 
        of goats? Offer unto God thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the Most High...</font></i><font size="+1">(Psalm 
        50:9-14)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, 
        the chief of these things which should have been utterly destroyed, to 
        sacrifice to the Lord </font></i><font size="+1">at Gilgul</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">And Samuel said, hath the Lord as great delight in 
        burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the Voice of the Lord? Behold, 
        to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
        Samuel 15:21,22).</font> </p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance of 
        sin every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats 
        should take away sin, wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith:</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">Sacrificeth and offerings thoou wouldst not, but A 
        Body thou hast prepared me; for in burnt</font></i> <i><font size="+1">and 
        sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure...</font></i></p>
      <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">Then said I, lo, I come, (in a volume 
        of a Book it is written of me), to do Thy Will O Lord...</font></i><font size="+1">(Hebrews 
        10:3...study the whole chapter in the light of the Oracles), (see Psalm 
        40:6-10 and Psalm 50)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>

        upon the altar as a burnt offering, because they burn out every fault,

        their own thoughts, and sacrifice their wicked life, by the sword of conversion, 
        they have placed themselves upon the altar of their own hearts, and kindled 
        themselves with the fire of Love. And the fat of the peace offering </font>(the

        from this victim; because the inward fatness of new love, making peace

        this self-same love continues inextinguishable in the heart of the Elect, 
        it is fitly subjoined, 'This is that perpetual fire, which will never 
        go out on the altar.' (Lev.6:13). This fire in truth will never go out 
        on the altar, because the glow of love continues on even after death.&quot;

  <p><font size="+1">One must perceive the fact here that not one species of beasts 
    or fowl, (the oxen, the goat, the Ram or the sheep, or the pigeon and turtle 
    dove), not one type or image, acceptable in the Law of God upon the altar 
    of sacrifice, is a scavenger (living on what it has not earned for itself), 
    or a meat eater (a killer, or a hunter, as is Nimrod the great warrior archetype). 
    For none of these qualities or attributes are acceptable in the soul that 
    is coming to spiritual perfection, much less in those who are bringing themselves 
    as a sacrifice upon the altar of Life itself.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">To &quot;chew the cud,&quot; and &quot;part the hoof,&quot; 
    means to meditate and repent, or change directions. The creature that finds 
    a quiet place to ruminate, to bring up and chew over again what it has already 
    ingested, is like a soul, who after hearing a precept of God, or some meaning 
    of a thing, or some word that purports to come from God, goes and thinks them 
    through again before it acts. It does not act immediately and carelessly like 
    the swine, (who indeed parts the hoof--snoughing up everything from every 
    direction that comes to it--but does not chew the cud), but finds time to 
    reflect on what it has heard. Only when the Word sits correctly in the mind, 
    and upon the soul, does the spiritual aspirant part the hoof--only then does 
    it change directions or walk in another path.</font></p>
