<p><font size="+1">We do not hold with the nationalistic and Zionistic, <i>Anglo-Israel</i> 
  doctrines of either the American Ambassador College (Armstrong's Worldwide Church 
  of God), or of Brit-Am Now, whose founder and teacher, Yair Davidiy, shares 
  the same basic views. These being that Britain and the United States of America 
  are the offspring of Joseph and his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, and that 
  the Zionist state of Israel is Judah, and that these nations themselves are 
  indeed the true manifested <i>Israel</i>. We see the mysteries of the true righteous 
  Nation, the Universal Israel, in a different light. We see Israel sojourning 
  through time and across the pages of history with these nations, but not being 
  one with them. (Except, that is, with the fact that the Zionist movement out 
  of Europe into the East is a fulfillment of the prophets who saw <i>Ephraim 
  going backwards</i>). We see how easy it has been for those who have forsaken 
  the Law and the Prophets and the course of history--the great mysterious pathway 
  of Sun and Moon to the Western ends of the earth--to get the history of these 
  peoples and nations mixed up and entangled with each other, seeing how the one 
  has both borrowed and stolen the precepts and the doctrines of the other. Nevertheless, 
  we will make good use of the work they have done in this regard, for in going 
  to the great lengths they have in trying to substantiate their own beliefs, 
  they have made it much easier for us to substantiate ours...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Answer: Encyclopedia Judaica:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> JUDAESAPTAN, legendary kingdom 
    in Austria. The legend, first printed in Hagen's chronicle (15th century), 
    relates how the Jew Abraham of Theomanaria arrived in Austria 800 years after 
    the flood and founded the kingdom of Judaesaptan whith its capital, Stockerau; 
    there he reigned for 33 years, while his sons ruled as tetrarchs in Korneuburg, 
    Tulin, and Vienna. The 16 th century historian Wolfgang Lazius, attempted 
    to establish the truth of the legend (which was considered historic fact even 
    in 1783) by interpreting Hebrew inscriptions on tombstones. Another version 
    speaks of two men, Saunas and Juda Saptai, who established the kingdom in 
    1700 B.C.E. Yet another version credits them with the founding of Vienna. 
    One chronicle enumerates 72 Jewish princes, ruling in Austria until 200 B.C.E.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From &quot;Lost Israelite Identity&quot; 
  (1996) by Yair Davidiy: <br>
  THE AUSTRIAN CHRONICLE, CIMMERIANS, AND ISRAEL. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The early center of Celtic Halstatt 
  civilization was centered in Austria. A Latin document known as The Austrian 
  Chronicle and purporting to be based on ancient traditions may shed some light 
  on Cimmerian origins. This source says that Central Europe had been subjected 
  by the Assyrians and that Jews exiled by Sennacherib were carried into Eastern 
  Europe along the Danube River. Beginning in ca. 707 b.c.e. says the Chronicle, 
  the <br>
  Jews overcame a certain King Gennan who then became Jewish; consequently, the 
  Jews intermarried with the local rulers in the regions of Austria and Hungary, 
  the pagans were subdued and the whole country was Jewish until ca.227 c.e. This 
  legend sounds quite far-fetched but it is interesting to compare it with known 
  fact: Many Jews from Judah were exiled by Sennacherib and they appear to have 
  joined the northern Lost Ten Tribes in Exile and to have become identified with 
  them; There are signs in Europe at this time of Assyrian influence; the Cimmerians 
  (who at the least included Israelites amongst them) did come westward in the 
  period ca. 700-650 b.c.e. and did <br>
  gain control; A Cimmerian-Celtic presence may have remained more or less dominant 
  in the area of Austria up until the late date ascribed to Jewish suzerainity. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Celtic Civilization in Austria is 
  referred to as Halstatt. The Halstatt civilisation of central and western Europe 
  was brought after conquest by a group using wagon burials19, long Assyrian type 
  swords, and a peculiar type of helmet. The said helmet appears to previously 
  have been employed by horsemen in the land of Israel, it was later found in 
  use by horsemen in Assyrian service, and was afterwards to be considered typically 
  &quot;Scythian&quot;. The horse gear of the newcomers to Halstatt was Oriental 
  and is recognisable as that employed by Assyrian cavalrymen or (depending on 
  which dates are relied on) was then being used contemporaneously by horsemen 
  in Assyrian employ. At the same time (or shortly before as mentioned above) 
  as the centre of Halstatt civilisation was being conquered, a different group 
  gained control of Hungary to the east. This second entity had emerged from Anatolia 
  after 660 and smashed the Illyrian power in the Balkans. They are identifiable 
  as another group of Cimmerians20 or Scythians. They practiced single burial21 
  and their horse gear connects them to the Caucasus22 and &quot;Iranian&quot;23 
  areas, and reveals them to have been close culturally to the Scyths proper24. 
  The two separate bodies intermerged and after ca.500 b.c.e.25 are indistinguishable. 
  Halstatt civilisation in its strict sense began well after 700 b.c.e. i.e. after 
  the arrival of the Cimmerians. Archaeologists have noticed &quot;striking <br>
  analogies in weapons and ornaments, in brooches and pottery found in Russian 
  Armenia and the Hallstatt area of Europe&quot;26. Russian Armenia means the 
  territory held by Urartu wherein the Cimmerians had previously established themselves. 
  The Cimmerians forefathered the Celts and &quot;it is generally agreed that 
  the Celts came from the east by the valley of the Danube&quot;27. The newcomers 
  in the west practiced four-wheeled chariot <br>
  burials. The wheels of their chariots are unlike those previously used in Urnfield 
  Europe BUT the same as those of Assyrian carts from the 700s b.c.e. as seen 
  on palace reliefs28. The chariots of Halstatt civilisation had a standard gauge 
  (3' 6&quot; to 3' 9&quot;), examples of which have been found in Britain, and 
  whose origins hark back to the city of Ur in ancient Mesopotamian Sumer.*29 
  Piggott noted &quot;how Asia Minor, Syria, and the far-off kingdom of <br>
  Urartu round Lake Van contributed to the toreutic art [i.e. metal embossing] 
  of prehistoric Europe&quot;30. Piggott was referring mainly to the Halstatt 
  period after 600 b.c.e. He noted both the Greek and Phoenician influences on 
  this art.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The term &quot;Phoenician&quot; 
  includes Israelite. The Neo-Assyrian era is associated with the re-settlement 
  of Israelite exiles. It was noticed that a new type of horse harness and bridle 
  from the era of king Sargon onwards led to a greater emphasis on the employment 
  of cavalry (as against chariotry) in the Assyrian armed forces. Regarding this 
  innovation from the 700s b.c.e. onwards, Piggot says that, &quot;Probably Cimmerian 
  north Pontic peoples&quot; were responsible for, &quot;the appearance of a whole 
  group of novel metal types associated with the bridle bits and harness of horses&quot;.... 
  &quot;From the Hungarian plain to the Swiss Lakes, Belgium, the south of France, 
  and even Britain and Scandinavia&quot;... &quot;Their distribution stretches 
  eastward to the Caucasus, and it has recently been pointed out that Assyrian 
  horse bits, constantly depicted on their monumental reliefs, change, late in 
  the eighth century, into versions of this same type,..&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">i.e. 
  Cimmerian migrations may be traced from the Assyrian-dominated Middle East across 
  Europe into Britain. They were noted for their equestrian specialties as the 
  exiled Israelites (with whom they are associable) had been. Apparently referring 
  to Cimmerian (and Scythian) influence on the <br>
  Assyrians, Urartians, and Persians, Piggot remarks: &quot; The Cimmerians have 
  been invoked as an ultimate agent in the further adoption of cavalry from the 
  seventh century onwards by the contemporary civilisations of antiquity&quot; 
  31. Similar traces of the Cimmerians also appear at Carcamish in north Syria 
  on the Euphrates and in Persia. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Yair Davidiy--connected heart and soul to that city in the 
  Middle East as he is--cannot entertain the notion that the Hebrew mind was already 
  established in Europe at the time of Abraham, or that they came back up to this 
  same place in the time of Jehoshua (for this would bring into question the legitimacy 
  of the Zionist State), but he does have the tribes of Israel wandering around 
  lost, and displaced among the other peoples of Europe as early as the 7th century 
  B.C. It is from these lost tribes, he reasons, formed those nations in time 
  that the world knows as Britain and America. We, on the other hand, transfer 
  the entire history of Israel into Europe, from the time of Abraham on, and again, 
  from the time of Moses on (save for those Samaritan tribes who remained in the 
  East to guard the Eastern gates). We say, however, that Israel always was--then 
  as well as now--a spiritual nation, a philosophy rather than a politic--a higher 
  state of Mind to be exact----that has always in its own spiritual perfection 
  remained separate from the other nations of men. It is only in its own historic 
  struggles with the issues of Light and Darkness (as bearers of the Oracles of 
  Creation), and therefore only in its apostasies and finally in its own historic 
  <i>falling away </i>in our times<i>, </i>that Israel gets entangled and becomes 
  associated with the other nations of the earth.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Before proceeding to the Chronicles themselves, 
  which have to do with the <i>hidden</i> wanderings of the patriarch Abraham, 
  we do well to discover for ourselves the content of the apocryphal Testament 
  of Abraham. It adds an essential dimension of understanding to our study. The 
  following account is from The Encyclopedia Judaica:</font></p>

    Jewish Origin of the Book. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent Discovery of Book. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An apocryphal book, published for 
    the first time by Montague Rhodes James, in two different recensions, in Robinson's 
    &quot;Texts and Studies,&quot; ii. No. 2 (Cambridge, 1892), and translated 
    FROM THE GREEK ORIGINAL by W. A. Craigie in the &quot;Ante-Nicene Library,&quot; 
    ix. 182-201. Ethiopic, Slavonic, and Rumanian versions also have been found, 
    and some of them published.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The book contains the story of 
    the death of Abraham, told in exactly the same form as that in which the death 
    of Moses is described by the ancient Haggadah; with the view of portraying 
    in poetic style the pious man, on the one hand, struggling against the fate 
    of mortality, and yet, on the other, enjoying, while still in mortal garb, 
    THE PRIVILEGE OF SURVAYING THE WHOLE WORLD WITH THE EYES OF AN IMMORTAL BEING 
    (see Moses, Ascension of, and Abraham, Apocalypse of). Abraham, the model 
    of a beneficent, hospitable, and just man, having reached the full measure 
    of life, God sends Michael, his chief general (compare Slavonic Book of Enoch, 
    xx. 6, and Buber's &quot;Midrash Agadah,&quot; p. 162, interpreting Josh. 
    v. 14), to prepare him for the approaching end. The archangel appears as a 
    common travelerto Abraham in the field, and is received with customary hospitality 
    and invited to Abraham's house. ON THEIR WAY HOME, ABRAHAM, WHO UNDERSTANDS 
    THE LANGUAGE OF TREES (AS DID JOHANAN BEN ZAKKAI Sukka, 28a), hears THE HUGE 
    TAMARISK TREE with its three hundred and thirty-one branches (Gen. xxi. 33) 
    singing a song which seems to be the foreboding of some misfortune (Zohar, 
    Wayera, Gen. xviii. 1, end). Tears spring to his eyes as he washes THE FEET 
    of the archangel; and Michael weeps also, his tears turning into pearls which 
    Abraham catches quickly, hiding them under his cloak. Michael, before sitting 
    down at the table, departs for a few moments, AS IT IS SUNSET, the time when 
    the ministering angels sing the praise of the Lord in heaven, and Michael, 
    their chief, must lead them (Yal?., Gen. &sect; 133). But, in addition to 
    this, Michael shrinks from bringing the tidings of approaching death to Abraham, 
    whose equal for goodness of heart is not to be found in the world. When God 
    reassures him by the promise that He will send a prophetic dream to Isaac, 
    announcing to him the death of his father, another difficulty presents itself 
    in reentering Abraham's house: How can he, a celestial being, partake of the 
    meal spread before him? God tells him to sit down at the table, and that He 
    will send over him &quot;a devouring spirit that shall eat up everything out 
    of his hands and mouth.&quot; Compare Justin Martyr, &quot;Dial. cum Tryph.&quot; 
    lvii., where the eating of the angels is compared with the eating of fire, 
    a view which differs from the Docetic one, which regards the eating of the 
    angels as merely apparent, not real (Tobit, xii. 19; Josephus, &quot;Ant.&quot; 
    i. 11, &sect; 2; Philo, &quot;De Abrahamo,&quot; &sect; 23, ed. Mangey, ii. 
    18; B. M. 86b; Gen. R. xlviii. 14, and most of the Church Fathers), and differs 
    also from the ingenuous one in the Targum on Gen. xviii. 8, and Tanna debe 
    Eli yahu R. 1</font>2.</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Immediately after midnight (the 
    time of divine favor, Ber. 3b) Isaac dreams of his father's death. Having 
    related the dream to Abraham, son and father begin to weep, thus rousing Sarah, 
    who recognizes Michael as one of the three angels (Gen. xviii. 1-10). According 
    to recension A, Michael had been the speaker of the three; while, according 
    to recension B, he had gone to rescue Lot (see Gen. R. 1. 2, and B. M. 86b). 
    Abraham confirms Sarah's observation; saying that, when washing Michael's 
    feet, he saw that the stranger was one of the angels (&quot;for their feet 
    were straight feet; and the sole of their foot like the sole of a calf's foot,&quot; 
    Ezek. i. 7; compare Gen. R. lxv. 21). Michael had also appeared to Isaac, 
    in his dream, as a man of gigantic size, shining more than SEVEN SUNS (see 
    Isa. xxx. 26), or, according to B, &quot;like the father of light&quot; (see 
    also Apoc. Mosis, &sect; 36: &quot;father of lights&quot;). He introduces 
    himself to Abraham as the archangel who stands before the face of the Lord 
    (Sar ha-Panim, &quot;Prince of the Presence,&quot; is Michael's original title 
    before he is transformed into the Me?a?ron&#151;Tan?uma, Genesis, ed. Buber, 
    p. 17, and Slavonic Book of Enoch, xxii. 6), and reveals to him the meaning 
    of the dream. But Abraham refuses to give him his soul. Michael returns to 
    the Lord, who orders him to plead with Abraham, and to tell him that all the 
    descendants of Adam and Eve must die, but that, as an especial token of divine 
    favor, he will be transferred to a better world without pain or the pangs 
    of death.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abraham's Visit to Heaven.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally Abraham yields; but at 
    the same time he requests Michael to intercede with the Lord and to ask that 
    he (Abraham) MAY BE PERMITTED TO SEE THE WHOLE WORLD CREATED BY ONE WORLD 
    (the &quot;ten creative words&quot;&#151;Ab. v. 1&#151;is a later rabbinical 
    view; see Mek., Shirah, x., ed. Weiss, 52b, end) before his death. The Lord 
    consents, and orders Michael to take a cloud of light, 'anan kabod (the rabbinical 
    'amuda de-nura, Ket. 17a, 62b), AND ANGELS OF THE CHARIOT (MERKABAH), and 
    to place Abraham in the chariot of the cherubim and to carry him (compare 
    II Kings, ii. 11, and Tanna debe Eliyahu R. v.) to heaven, WHENCE HE WOULD 
    BE ABLE TO SURVEY THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. His ride begins with THE GREAT SEA (mistranslated 
    in the Apocr. &quot;ocean&quot;; but compare Slavonic Book of Enoch, iii. 
    3, and &quot;the waters above the firmament,&quot; Gen. i. 6). While surveying 
    all the world with its joys and woes, its beautiful and evil things, he is 
    filled with indignation at the sight of the awful crimes committed; and he 
    asks the archangel to smite all malefactors with instant death&#151;which 
    he did. But a voice resounds from heaven, crying: &quot;O Arch-angel Michael, 
    order the chariot to stop, and turn Abraham away, lest, seeing that all live 
    in wickedness, he destroy all creation. For behold Abraham, not having sinned 
    himself, has no pity for sinners; but I, who made the world, take no delight 
    in destroying any, but await the death of the sinner, that he may be converted 
    and live.&quot; MICHAEL DIRECTS THE HEAVENLY CHARIOT EASTWARD </font>(in what 
    land)?<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> TOWARD PARADISE (B. B. 84a; 
    Ethiopic Book of Enoch, xxxii.; and Slavonic Book of Enoch, xlii. 3), near 
    which Gehenna lies, separated only by a handbreadth (Yal?., Eccl. &sect; 976). 
    At this point an interesting picture of the Judgment of the Souls is presented: 
    Two gates, one narrow and one wide, lead into heaven; and before them sits 
    upon a golden throne a man whose appearance is terrible like that of the Lord. 
    It is Adam, the image of the Lord (B. B. 58a); and all the souls pass by him&#151;the 
    just through the narrow gate and the wicked through the wide gate, each by 
    his own merit or demerit, but none encumbered by Adam's sin (Tan., Num., ed. 
    Buber, p. 124; Zohar, Gen. vii. 6). Abraham is allowed to watch the procedure 
    of judgment within the wide gate. He sees the scourging angels called malake 
    ?abbalah (Eccl. R. iv. 3), malake sa?an (Tosef., Shab. xvii. 3), &quot;fierce 
    of appearance, pitiless of mind, lashing the souls with fiery tongues.&quot; 
    On a table is spread A BOOK OF TEN CUBITS IN BREADTH AND FIVE CUBITS IN THICKNESS 
    (a combination of Ezekiel, ii. 9, and Zechariah, v. 1, 2; see Erubin, 21a), 
    in which all the good and all the bad actions of man are recorded by two angels. 
    As to the many parallels in the apocryphal literature, compare Harnack's notes 
    to his edition of &quot;Herm&aelig; Pastor&quot; i. 3, &sect; 2, and Baraita, 
    R. H. 16b; also Slavonic Book of Enoch, xix. 5. While the two angels officiate 
    temporarily as recorders during the judgment (?ag. 16a), the permanent recorder 
    is Enoch (see Book of Enoch and Targ. Yer. Gen. v. 24), &quot;the teacher 
    of heaven and earth, the scribe of righteousness.&quot; BUT THE ACTIONS OF 
    THE MAN ARE ALSO WEIGHED IN THE SCALES, TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE GOOD OUTWEIGH 
    THE BAD, ENABLING THE SOUL TO ENTER PARADISE, or whether the bad prevail, 
    resulting in the consignment of the soul to Gehenna. In case, however, his 
    good and evil deeds are equal in weight, the soul has to undergo the process 
    of purification by fire, remaining in an intermediate state (Benoni) corresponding 
    to the purgatory of the Church (compare Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 3; 'Er. 19a; ?ag. 
    27a; Origen, in Psalm xxxvii. hom. 3; Ambrose, enarratio in Psalm xxxvii. 
    No. 26). But the weighing of the sins is also done for the purpose of ascertaining 
    their quality, since there are light and heavy ones, sins such as adultery 
    being compensated for only by many good actions (R. H. 17a). The name of the 
    weighing angel is very significant&#151;Dokiel (compare Isa. xl. 15, 21, &quot;by 
    the dust [] in the balance&quot;; see Jerome on this passage), while the angel 
    who probes the soul is called Puriel, from the Greek word for fire, p??. This 
    apocrypha contains an utterance of God which is peculiar to it: &quot;I shall 
    not judge man [see Gen. vi. 3]; therefore shall Abel, the first man born of 
    woman, be judge.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abraham is then represented in 
    a touching way as pitying a soul that is just being weighed, and that lacks 
    but one meritorious act to outbalance its evil doings. He intercedes on its 
    behalf; the angels join in; and the soul is at last admitted into paradise. 
    The merit of the pious helping the sinner is often mentioned in rabbinical 
    and apocryphal literature (compare Slavonic Book of Enoch, vii. 4, and Apoc. 
    Mosis, 33; So?ah, 10b). Abraham now reproaches himself for having previously 
    caused the death of the malefactors by his excessive zeal, but is assured 
    by God that &quot;an uncommon mode of death works pardon for all sins,&quot; 
    and that, consequently, his act was beneficial (compare Sanh. 43b).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abraham Refuses to Yield His Soul.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abraham, having seen THE ENTIRE 
    WORLD ABOVE AND BELOW, is carried back to his own house by the arch-angel, 
    who for the third time is commanded by God to take Abraham's soul; but (as 
    is the case with Moses in the legend) Abraham persistently refuses to surrender 
    it to him. Michael returns to the Lord, saying: &quot;I care not to lay hand 
    upon Abraham, who was Thy friend from the beginning and has none like him 
    on earth, not even Job, the marvelous man&quot;; meaning that Abraham had 
    learned to worship the One God as a child of three (or thirteen) years (see 
    Abraham, where the different traditions of the rabbis are given), whereas 
    Job became a worshiper of the Lord only when he was king (see Job, Testament 
    of). Furthermore, Abraham worshiped God from love, while Job only feared the 
    Lord (compare Mishnah So?ah, v. 5 [27b]).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another plan for obtaining the 
    soul of Abraham is resorted to. Death (Azazel), the angel of the dauntless 
    countenance and of the pitiless look, who spares neither young nor old, is 
    commanded to appear in the guise of a bright and beautiful angel before Abraham. 
    This disguise is considered necessary lest Abraham, as Moses did after him, 
    might drive Death off at once by using the power of the Holy Name (), but 
    when the angel tells him that he, &quot;the bitter cup of death&quot; (Samael), 
    has come to take his soul, Abraham refuses to go with him. The Angel of Death 
    thereupon arouses Abraham's curiosity by saying that the form in which he 
    appears is not his real one; the very sight of which would, by its terrors, 
    bring death to the sinner. Abraham naturally expresses the wish to see him 
    in his true form, and the angel then appears with his SEVEN SERPENT HEADS 
    and fourteen faces; and the very sight kills seven thousand male and female 
    slaves of Abraham's household, Abraham himself becoming sick unto death (compare 
    M. ?. 28a, concerning the &quot;terrors of the Angel of Death,&quot; and the 
    description in 'Ab. Zarah, 20b of his face full of many terrible eyes and 
    of the bitter cup of poison which he carries with him to cast into the mouths 
    of mortals as they open them at the ghastly sight, so as to kill them; see 
    also Jellinek, &quot;B. H.&quot; i. 150). Abraham restores the lives of the 
    seven thousand slaves by his prayer, and then causes the Angel of Death to 
    explain to him all the terrible faces which he has shown to him, as well as 
    the seventy-two kinds of death, timely and untimely, that men may meet.This 
    number seventy-two has nothing to do with the seventy-two nations (M. R. James), 
    but is the same as the seventy-two plagues which visit the body of Adam in 
    consequence of his sin in paradise (Vita Ad&aelig; et Ev&aelig;, 34), and 
    is found in Tanna debe Eliyahu R. v. and originally as a rabbinical tradition 
    of 'Akabia b. Mehalalel (Sifra, Tazri'a, 2).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God Takes Abraham's Soul.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abraham, however, does not fully 
    recover from the shock; and God (according to recension B, which is here more 
    consistent than A) removes his soul &quot;as in a dream&quot;&#151;for which 
    the more poetic expression of the rabbis is &quot;by a kiss&quot; (B. B. 17a). 
    Then Michael, the heavenly caretaker of souls (Apoc. Mosis, ed. Tischendorf, 
    20f, and &quot;Pe?irat Mosheh&quot;), with a host of angels, comes and wraps 
    Abraham in heaven-spun linen and anoints him with paradisiacal incense (nullcomp. 
    Adam, Book of), and after the lapse of three days they bury him UNDER THE 
    TREE OF MAMRE (compare Gen. R. c.). Then, amid hymns and praises of the saints, 
    they carry his soul up to heaven, and having prostrated himself before God 
    the Father, Abraham, the friend of God, is brought into paradise to the pavilions 
    of the righteous (compare B. B. 75b: &quot;The Lord shall build pavilions 
    for the righteous ones, for each according to his merit,&quot; &quot;where 
    there is neither trouble nor grief nor anything but peace and rejoicing and 
    life unending&quot;&#151;Ber. 17a).</font></p>

    was a Pharisee or, as Kohler asserts, an Essene, can not be determined here, 
    though it is significant that the Law is not once mentioned. The view of retribution, 
    as presented in the Testament, certainly precludes Sadducean authorship. As 
    regards the two recensions, A and B, neither is probably a faithful translation 
    of the Hebrew original; and the reconstruction, here attempted for the first

  the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are fragmentary records which 
  unveil what really happened in Europe. In museums and libraries, in state archives 
  are still to be found documents of hoary antiquity corroborating the Biblical 
  record. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This chapter contains the account 
  of one of those documents. It is a history of the Danubian Valley -- the area 
  of Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Bavaria and neighboring regions. The document 
  is the &quot;Oesterreichische Chronik&quot; -- the Austrian Chronicle. It has 
  never before been rendered into modern English. A number of copies of the Chronicle 
  are scattered throughout Europe. The last entry in the Chronicle is of the year 
  1404. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ABRAHAM IN THE AUSTRIAN CHRONICLE 
  <br>
  The Austrian Chronicle begins its consecutive history with a man of princely 
  birth -- none other than the patriarch Abraham! But what has Abraham to do with 
  the history of the Danubian Valley in Europe? Very much. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most ancient Greek name for the 
  Danube River was the River Noe. Noe is the Greek form of the Hebrew Noah. Noah 
  was the patriarch of the whole human family following the flood. His patriarchal 
  authority passed on to Shem, who superseded his older brother Japheth. In each 
  succeeding generation the hereditary right of the firstborn was passed on from 
  father to son. </font>(These are literary figures, products of the Hebrew genius,, 
  not actual historical personages)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
  Terah was eighth in descent from Shem (Genesis 11:10-26), and the heir to Noah 
  and Shem. Terah had, according to the Biblical record, three sons. The oldest, 
  Haran, was born when Terah was 70 years old (Gen. 11:26). He died before his 
  father Terah did (Gen 11:28). &quot;And Haran died in the presence of his father 
  Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur OF THE CHALDEES.&quot; Why Haran died 
  young will be made plain shortly from the Austrian Chronicle. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Replacing Haran as heir was Terah's 
  second son, Abram </font>(a figure of the Vedic Father, Brahma)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
  (whose name was later changed to Abraham). In the year 1941 </font>(BC) <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God 
  called Abraham to forsake his kindred, his country -- everything. &quot;Now 
  the Lord said unto Abram: 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, 
  and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee. And I will 
  bless thee, and make thy name great ...'&quot; (Gen. 12:1-2). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abram 
  had to give up his hereditary privileges. Though he was a &quot;mighty prince&quot; 
  (Gen. 23:6), he willingly forsook his inherited rights. &quot;So Abram went, 
  &quot;declares verse 4....</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;And the Lord said to Abraham (those anonymous adepts in the Hebrew 
    mysteries who returned to the center of the Oracle in the name of Brahma), 
    Depart from thy land, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house to 
    a land that I will shew thee... </p>
  <p>God, wishing to purify the soul of man, first of all gives it an impulse 
    towards complete salvation, namely a change of abode, so as to quit the three 
    regions--of the Body, the Outward Senses, and (the old manner) of Speech.</p>
  <p>For his country is the emblem of the body, and his kindred are a symbol of 
    the outward senses, and his father's house is speech. Why so? Because the 
    body derives its composition from the earth...And the outward senses are nearly 
    connected with and akin to the mind, the irrational part to the rational, 
    since they are both parts of the soul. But speech is the abode of the father 
    because our Father is the mind which implants in each of its parts its own 
    power, and distributes its energies among them... </p>
  <p>And you must not wonder that Moses has called speech in man the abode of 
    the mind, for he also says that the Mind, or the Universe, that is to say 
    God, has for his abode his own Word...</p>
  <p>And that he means by Abraham's country the Body, and by his kindred the Outward 
    Senses, and by his father's house Uttered Speech, we have shown. But the commandment 
    'Depart from them,' is not like 'Be separated from them according to your 
    essence' for that would be the injunction of one who was pronouncing a sentence 
    of death. But it is the same as saying 'Be alienated from them in your mind,' 
    allowing none of them to cling to you, standing above them all; they are your 
    subjects, use them not as your rulers; since you are a king, learn to govern 
    and not be governed.&quot; <b>On the Migrations of Abraham, by Philo Judaeus</b>.</p>
  
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Now consider the Austrian Chronicle. 
  It begins with the birth of Abram (he is called Abraham throughout the Chronicle) 
  under the Assyrian Count Sattan of Aligem (sect 41). (Several of the earliest 
  geographic names in the Chronicle are otherwise unknown from contemporary records.) 
  Abram &quot;took to wife SUSANNA FROM THE LAND OF SAMAM </font>(Compare the 
  apocryphal History of Susanna which immediately precedes The History of the 
  Destruction of Bel and the Dragon in the KJV of the Apocrypha)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
  the daughter of Terromant and his wife Sanyet.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of this union we read in Scripture: 
  &quot;And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. But unto the sons of the 
  concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and he sent them away from 
  Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country&quot; -- 
  Assyria (Gen. 25:5-6). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the Austrian Chronicle we learn 
  that &quot;Abraham and Susanna had a son Achaim.&quot; Then &quot;Abraham of 
  Temonaria and Count Sattan of Aligemorum had war with each other, till Abraham 
  was driven from the land in poverty.&quot; It was in this war that Haran, Abram's 
  older brother, was slain. Abram was driven out of Count Sattan's realm AND FLED 
  TO THE DANUBE RIVER VALLEY in 1945, according to the Chronicle. There he built 
  a home and settled until the death of Count Sattan. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was now 1942 -- three years after 
  Abram fled. Abram, according to the Chronicle, took Achaim and Susanna and went 
  to THE LAND OF JUDEISAPTA -- &quot;THE JEWS LAND&quot; -- Palestine, according 
  to the Bible. (The later scribes who copied the Austrian Chronicle assumed it 
  was the Danube Valley because Jews were later settled there also.) From Palestine 
  Abraham sent away eastward to Assyria Susanna and Achaim (in Isaac's second 
  year). From there they journeyed to the Danubian settlement Abram made years 
  before. The previous chapter revealed that the Danubian Valley was then under 
  Assyrian hegemony </font>(continued)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Hoeh's interpretation of these Chronicles runs afoul of itself 
  here, where he seems to be connecting Judaesaptan with a place in Palestine. 
  The biblical authors never placed it there, knowing as they did that that the 
  Hebrew adepts in the Brahman (Vedic) mysteries came directly to that place in 
  the center of Europe--the place from which the Saptan mysteries were carried 
  into India to begin with:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and 
    from thence it parted and became into Four heads...</i>(Genesis 2:10-14).</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now the garden was watered 
    by One river which ran round about the whole earth, and it was parted into 
    Four parts. And Phison, which denotes a multitude, running into India, makes 
    its exit into the sea, AND IS BY THE GREEKS CALLED GANGES. </font>(Thus the 
    teachings of Adam/Manu found there way into the entire structure of Vedic 
    philosophy).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Euphrates also, as well as Tigris,

    already seen--is where the great Red Serpent lives, and this creature comprises 
    all the peoples and nations that inhabit the body of the great Continent, 
    Leviathan)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Now the name Euphrates, 
    or Prath, denotes either a dispersion, or a Flower; By Tigris, or Diglath,

<p>(Hoeh asks):<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Who, then, brought the 
  Jews into Eastern Europe seven centuries before the birth of Jesus.? The answer 
  has been in the Bible all these years! It is found in II Kings 18:13-16. &quot;Now 
  in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come 
  up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them. And Hezekiah king 
  of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying: 'I have offended; return 
  from me; that which thou puttest on me will I bear.' And the king of Assyria 
  appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty 
  talents of gold. And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the 
  house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house. At that time did 
  Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord, and from 
  the door-posts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the 
  king of Assyria.&quot; A parallel account may be read in either II Chronicles 
  32 or Isaiah 36. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notice the dates of this event -- 
  the fourteenth year of Hezekiah -- 711-710. Sennacherib was at this time associated 
  with his father on the throne of Assyria. A vigorous general, he captured all 
  the fortified cities of Judah except Jerusalem, enslaved the inhabitants. Where 
  he carried them had been unknown to historians. But the answer is preserved 
  for us in the &quot;Austrian Chronicle&quot;. He carried them into Eastern Europe 
  along the Danube River. But how could an Assyrian king of Nineveh plant tens 
  of thousands of Jewish captives in Europe? -- BECAUSE CENTRAL EUROPE WAS THEN

<p>CHAPTER V <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  THE CONQUESTS OF ODIN AND DANISH HISTORY <br>
  Many a school boy has heard of Odin, the great Norse hero. But how many realize 
  that Odin was a real king of Denmark? That he founded the kingdom of Denmark 
  in the days of David, king of Israel? That he visited Solomon's temple? of that 
  Odin was the first Danish king to cross the Atlantic -- as did Danish Vikings 
  centuries later? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For centuries Danes revered the history 
  of their nation. Not until the atheistic educational philosophy of German schools 
  permeated their country did the Danes discard the early history of their nation. 
  Modern historians, imbued with the idea that myth was the only form in which 
  early man knew how to write, treat all Danish history as myth. They have never 
  investigated to see whether it were so. of course myth was grafted in the Middle 
  Ages on the early history of Denmark. That tragedy befell all nations under 
  the sway of religious superstition in the Middle Ages. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But that does not prove that the 
  essential core of early Danish history is invalid. Today historians labor under 
  the delusion that history was artificially created after traditional mythology 
  had long been established. Not so. Recorded and traditional history around the 
  world was carefully preserved in palaces and royal libraries. Only later did 
  myth embrace history, </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT THE HISTORY OF DENMARK REVEALS 
  <br>
  Now is the time to restore the lost history of Denmark. The most accessible 
  outline of Danish history is that found in Anderson's &quot;Royal Genealogies&quot;. 
  Many other volumes contribute to the story, but only Anderson's work correctly 
  preserves in English the chronology of the early period. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Danish written history properly begins 
  with the first king to bear rule over the Danish or Cymbric peninsula. That 
  king was Danus I. In Danish history he is also called Dan I. He was the first 
  Odin or Votan -- from the Hebrew &quot;adonai&quot; meaning &quot;lord.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DENMARK ORIGINALLY RECEIVED ITS NAME 
  FROM THE TRIBE OF THE DANAAN. It passed to the king who took the name of the 
  subjects over whom he ruled. King Dan I commenced his reign in 1040. This was 
  the year of the break-up of the German realm. The division of German territory 
  among the three sons of Wolfheim -- Kells, Gall and Hiller -- left the seafarers 
  of the far northwest of Europe without leadership. To fill the void the German 
  and Hebrew inhabitants of Denmark called upon the scion of the Trojan House 
  to reign over them. That scion was Dan I. He lived at the time IN THRACE. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE GENEALOGY OF DAN I <br>
  The present kings of Northwestern Europe and Great Britain are all related to 
  Dan I of Denmark. The &quot;Saxon Chronicle&quot; commences the line of Dan 
  I with the following two names: &quot;Noah, Sem.&quot; Thereafter a long break 
  occurs in the genealogy -- similar to the Biblical statement: &quot;Jesus Christ, 
  the son of David, the son of Abraham&quot; (Matthew l:l). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This gap in Odin's genealogy is partially 
  filled in by the Icelandic &quot;Langfedgatal&quot;. After Sem, the &quot;Langfedgatal&quot; 
  gives the following genealogy on Odin's father's side: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Saturnus 
  of Krit ; Jupiter; Darius; Erichhonius; Troes; Ilus; Lamedon; Priam, King of 
  Troy <br>
  <br>
  Minon or Memnon, who married Priam's daughter. Their son was Tror, whom we call 
  Thor, the father of Hloritha. Thor; Einridi; Vingethorr; Vingener; Moda; Magi; 
  Seskef, or Sescef.&quot; <br>
  </font></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Danish literature Seskef -- sometimes 
  spelled Sceaf -- is a title of Odin. It means a &quot;sheaf&quot; of grain. 
  Odin claimed to be a kind of savior, or a lord. He laid claim to being the sheaf 
  that symbolically represented the Messiah (Leviticus 23:9-14). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
  why should Dan I, a king of Denmark, copy a ceremony perpetuated by the law 
  of Moses? IS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN ODIN AND ISRAEL? </font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/NordicWeek.gif" width="550" height="400"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The answer is found in who Saturnus 
  of Krit, ancestor of Odin, really was. In modern English the name would be Saturn 
  of Crete. There were many Saturns in antiquity, often confused with one another. 
  Usually the name was applied to a man who flees or who hides himself. Saturn 
  is a Latin word derived from a root meaning to flee into hiding. The Greek term 
  was Kronos. This particular Saturn of Crete was so famous that the Phoenician 
  historian Sanchoniathon spoke of him. Fragments of his works have been preserved 
  by Eusebius in &quot;Preparation of the Gospel&quot;, book i, ch. x. Here are 
  his words: &quot;For Kronus or (Saturn), whom the Phoenicians call Israel ....&quot; 
  (&quot;Corey's Ancient Fragments of the Phoenician, Carthaginian, Babylonian, 
  Egyptian and other Authors&quot;, by E. Richmond Hodges, page 21.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Israel was the name of Jacob. That 
  would make Odin a son of Shem and a son of Jacob. But why was Jacob called Saturn? 
  Because Jacob became famous for fleeing or hiding from his enemies. Jacob's 
  mother warned him of his brother Esau's wrath: &quot;Now, therefore, my son, 
  hearken to my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother in Haran&quot; 
  (Genesis 27:43). &quot;And it was told Laban ... that Jacob was fled&quot; -- 
  this time back to Palestine. (Gen. 31:22). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
  how is one to account for the title to Crete in Jacob's name? Certainly Jacob 
  did not have title to it prior to descending into Egypt. The answer is, Jacob 
  obtained it from Pharaoh in Egypt. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are the facts. Egypt was a vast 
  Mediterranean power in the days of Jacob. One of the areas early settled by 
  Egyptians was the island of Crete, an important naval gateway in the Mediterranean. 
  From Crete -- Caphtor in Hebrew -- came the Philistines (Jer. 47:4 and Amos 
  9:7). The Philistines descended from Mizraim, father of the Egyptians (Gen. 
  10:13-14). Ruling over the Egyptians and Philistines in Crete and the eastern 
  Nile Delta was a little-known dynasty of Egyptian kings. They are mentioned 
  in the &quot;Book of Sothis&quot; by Sncellus. Manetho does not include them 
  among his dynasties. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The king of this dynasty, who was 
  subject to the jurisdiction of the great Pharaoh in Egypt, was Rameses (l744-1715). 
  Because of Joseph's service to the Egyptian government, the Pharaoh transferred 
  primary title to the Land from the line of Rameses to the line of Israel -- 
  and that included not only Goshen, but Crete! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that is how Israel (Jacob) anciently 
  obtained title to the island of Crete. The &quot;Langfedgatal&quot; genealogy 
  of Odin of Denmark may therefore be clarified as follows: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saturnus 
  of Krit -- Israel or Jacob (1856-1709); Jupiter, son of Saturn of Krit -- Judah; 
  Darius, descendant of Jupiter (Judah) -- is Dara or Darda (see the family name 
  in I Chronicles 2:4,6); Josephus calls him Dardanus (1477-1412); he fled Italy 
  and founded Troy (the Norse geneaology skips the names of Tarah and Mahol between 
  Judah and Darda) <br>
  <br>
  Erichhonius -- Ericthonius (1412-1366), second king of Troy; Troes -- Tros (1366-1326), 
  third king of Troy Ilus -- Illus (1326-1277), fourth king of Troy; Lamedon -- 
  Laomedon (1277-1233), fifth king of Troy ; Priam -- Priamus (1233-1181), king 
  of Troy during first Trojan war<br>
  </font></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eighth in descent from Priam was 
  Seskef, who was Danus I or Odin (Votan), first king of Denmark -- 1040-999. 
  Odin was a Hebrew, of the line of Judah, from whom the chief rulers were to 
  come. &quot;For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief 
  ruler&quot; (I Chron. 5:2). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now consider over whom Odin ruled 
  in Northwest Europe. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;HU THE MIGHTY&quot; <br>
  King Danus' realm extended far beyond the reaches of the Danish peninsula. The 
  people over whom he ruled were a collection of tribes which constituted the 
  greatest sea power of the time -- the Pelasgians or sea people. From the list 
  of sea powers, commented on in Volume I of the Compendium, it is proved that 
  the Pelasgians were Hebrews and their allies. Their chief center of habitation 
  was Palestine. Denmark was one of several overseas settlements. Israel gained 
  power in 1057, shortly before the break-up of Germany in Europe. They retained 
  it until 972, when Solomon's kingdom in Palestine was split. For the Israelites 
  to have obtained dominion of the sea in 1057 in the Mediterranean and Atlantic 
  presupposes that they already were living along the western shores of Europe 
  before that date. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When and how did the Children of 
  Israel migrate to Western Europe? The answer is found in Cymbric or Welsh history. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A fragmentary Welsh record, called 
  the Welsh Triad, reads as follows: &quot;First was the race of the Cymry, who 
  came with Hu Gadarn to Ynys Prydain.&quot; Hu came from &quot;the land of summer&quot; 
  -- a land located somewhere in what later constituted the realm of Constantinople 
  (the capital of the eastern Roman Empire). He journeyed to Ynys Pridain -- the 
  Welsh name of the Isle of Britain. This first major settlement preceded the 
  migration in 1149 of Brutus of Troy to Britain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who was Hu Gadarn? Gadarn is a Welsh 
  word. It means the &quot;Mighty.&quot; Hu was a short form of the Old Celtic 
  name Hesus (&quot;Origines Celticae&quot;, by Edwin Guest, vol. 2, p. 9). Hesus 
  is the Celtic -- and also the Spanish -- pronunciation of Jesus. Was there a 
  famous &quot;Jesus&quot; who lived in the balmy summerland of the eastern Mediterranean 
  centuries before the time of Jesus the Christ? Most certainly! It is found in 
  Hebrews 4:8, &quot;For if Jesus that is, Joshua) had given them rest, then would 
  he not afterward have spoken of another day.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus was merely the Greek form of 
  the Hebrew name Joshua. Hu or Hesus the Mighty was Joshua the Mighty, the great 
  general who led Israel into Palestine. And the Welsh Triad records that in his 
  later years he also settled Israel peaceably in the British Isle. From there, 
  for trading purposes, they spread to the coasts of the continent which were 
  subject to the German Cymry -- the descendants of the German king Cimbrus (1679-1635). 
  That is how Israel in Denmark came to be known by the tribal name of Cymry. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As time elapsed the peninsula of 
  Denmark became a chief area of trade and commerce. It is strategically located 
  to dominate both North and Baltic sea trade. So together with the original German 
  tribes of the Cymry and Dauciones were migrants from Britain. In 1040 the Hebrew 
  Cymry called for a descendant of Judah, a royal scion of the House of Troy, 
  to rule over them. Odin answered the call and led a migration out of Thrace 
  into Denmark and neighboring regions. The deeds of Odin upon becoming king over 
  the Cymry (sometimes spelled Cymbri) will be included in a later section on 
  the American Indian. </font></p>

  SCOTLAND -- KEY TO HISTORY OF NEW WORLD <br>
  The Key to the history of the New World has been lost. Not a single historian 
  or archaeologist knows the true origin of American Indian civilization. And

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT HISTORIANS CLAIM <br>
  The famous eight-volume &quot;History of Scotland&quot;, by John Hill Burton, 
  begins the history of Scotland this way: &quot;It is in the year 80 of the Christian 
  era that the territory in later times known as Scotland comes out of utter darkness, 
  and is seen to join the current of authentic history. In that year Julius Agricola 
  brought Roman troops north ....&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a typical -- but mistaken 
  -- view of Scottish history. Historians have made an idol out of Roman records. 
  What the Romans either refused to preserve, or carelessly neglected to record, 
  is all too often treated with contempt by modern historians. Scotland was never 
  long under the Roman heel. The Romans were not particularly interested in its 
  rocky highlands. Consequently they did not occupy themselves with recording 
  the major events of the past that befell its inhabitants. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, numerous documents are available 
  covering the history of Scotland from very early times. These chronicles are 
  usually disparaged in historical circles -- or at most treated as quaint and 
  curious documents. But to restore the lost history of Scotland from them is 
  frowned on with disdain. Yet in these records are the missing links which, until 
  now, have sundered the Old World from the New. It is time the true story of 
  Scotland were made known. Here, in outline form, are the major events that make

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FIRST MAJOR SETTLEMENT <br>
  The geographic location of Scotland is important in its history. Scotland is 
  the link between Scandinavia and Britain and Ireland. Its shores provide control 
  of the far reaches of the North Sea and the ocean. Scotland was consequently 
  invaded, peaceably and by frightful devastation, several times in its history. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first permanent settlement of 
  Scotland, for which we have recorded history, begins with the coming of Danus 
  I of Denmark in 1040. When the Cimbric tribes called upon an heir of the Trojan 
  throne to establish his domain in Denmark, Odin responded immediately. Out of 
  southeastern Europe he marched into Denmark. Coming with him was a mixed tribe 
  known as the Agathyrsi. Agathirsi was their name, declares an old Scottish Chronicle. 
  (&quot;Controversial Issues in Scottish History&quot;, by W. H. Gregg, p. 125.) 
  Odin settled them in Scotland under their leader Cruithne -- after whom they 
  were called Cruithnians or Cruithne. HERODOTUS, THE GREEK HISTORIAN, TRACES 
  THE AGATHYRSI TO THEIR ORIGINS IN THE SCYTHIAN PLAINS of what is now the southern 
  Ukraine The Agathyrsi were a mixed race. Various struggles led to a catastrophe 
  among the Agathyrsi who came with Odin. They found themselves without women! 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>It was in the far-reaching context of these events that the Hebrew texts 
    were composed. And because Ezekiel referred to these Scythians who appeared 
    out of the steppes of ancient Russia, as &quot;Gog,&quot; that branch of the 
    American church which is given to (too much) prophetic interpretation still 
    refers to the (then) Soviet Union as &quot;Gog and Magog.&quot; (Ezekiel 38 
    and 39). This because these also believes that present-day Israel is the Israel 
    of the prophets, and because, not sensing or allowing for the overarching 
    course of history, or for the link between the Scythians and their Western 
    cousins...</p>
  <p>&quot;Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now call Galatians (Galls) but 
    were then called Gomerites...Magog founded those that were from him called 
    Magogites, but who were by the Greeks called Scythians.&quot; Antiquities 
    I.VI.1.</p>
  <p>...believe that the Soviets (Russia) must still fulfill those prophecies 
    that were fulfilled by America and her allies when they attacked Europe from 
    the West during the World Wars--just as the Scythian alliance attacked it 
    from the East in the 6th century B.C. Thus the canon of both the Old and the 
    New Testaments (in the KJV) conclude with the Babylonian epic--just as these 
    times shall conclude with the Nation-church's deliverance from the judgment 
    of America, as it is written: Come out of her my people...for her sins have 
    reached unto heaven. (Revelation 18).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...As a consequence they sought wives 
  among neighboring tribes. They landed in Ireland at the time of the establishment 
  of the Milesian monarchy under Ghede the Herimon (1016-1002). Following a few 
  skirmishess an agreement was reached. The Milesians of Ireland agreed to give 
  wives to the Agathyrsi from their daughters on one condition: that the Agathyrsi 
  would pass on their inheritance through their daughters, not their sons. This 
  was to acknowledge that any royalty which might follow derived kingship from 
  their Milesian wives, not from the Agathyrsi men. On this condition the Agathyrsi 
  departed again for Scotland. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LINE OF JUDAH IN SCOTLAND <br>
  The women who journeyed in that day to Scotland were Milesians -- of the family 
  of Mileadh. In volume I of the Compendium the history of the kingly line from 
  Mileadh to the present throne in Great Britain was given in its entirety. ITS 
  ANCIENT CONNECTION TO THE THRONE OF DAVID, IN JUDAH, WAS MADE PLAIN. But the 
  genealogy of Mileadh was not included. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The line of Mileadh, in Irish records, 
  properly begins with Easru in Egypt. The name Easru is Old Irish for Ezra or 
  Azariah. Easru was a friend of Moses. One Irish tradition has him crossing the 
  Red Sea with the children of Israel. Another tradition has him journeying, after 
  the Exodus, to Scythia. Irish annalists became confused by these two movements 
  of Easru and his family. It never occurred to them that he might have crossed 
  the Red Sea with Moses, and then, at a later time journeyed to Scythia. </font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/dragon.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p align="center">The Red Sea. It is where the Great Dragon lives.</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No Irish records preserve the ancestry 
  of Easru or Azariah. Many myths were later created by Irish monks to account 
  for this blank. It seems not to have occurred to them that the Bible might record 
  the ancestry of Easru, ending at the Exodus. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The previous volume of the Compendium 
  established the significant fact that the symbol of the line of Easru and Mileadh 
  was the Crimson or Red Branch -- signifying the royal line Zarah, Judah's son 
  (Genesis 38:30). Now open the Bible to the genealogy of Judah. &quot;And the 
  sons of Zarah: Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol, and Dara .... And the 
  sons of Ethan: Azariah&quot; (I Chronicles 2:6, 8). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is an Azariah, of the family 
  of Judah -- and of Zarah, the Red Branch. Azariah was of the same generation 
  as Moses -- both were great-great-grandsons of Jacob (compare with Exodus 6:16-20). 
  Notice also that Azariah's descendants did not enter Palestine. His genealogy 
  is not continued beyond the Exodus. That is significant. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further, the name Azariah in Hebrew 
  is often shortened to Ezra (see any Biblical encyclopaedia). Its Old Irish form 
  would be Easru. So here we have an Azariah (or Ezra), of the same generation 
  as Moses, Living at the time of the Exodus, whose descendants did not settle 
  in Palestine, and who was of the Crimson Branch. At the same time Irish history 
  reveals an Easru -- Old Irish for Azariah or Ezra -- living in Moses' day, crossing 
  the Red Sea, but not settling in Palestine, whose descendants in after generations 
  used the symbol of the Crimson Branch! Here is the line of Zarah -- Judah! Easru 
  is Azariah, Judah's great-great-grandson. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In chart form (from the Bible and 
  Stokvis' Manuel) the Milesian princely line appears thus: Jacob; Judah; Zarah; 
  Ezra; Ethan; Azariah, who is Easru; Sru; Eibher Scot; Beogamon; Ogamon; Tait 
  </font>(and so on to)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ghede the Herimon, 
  who gave daughters of the royal family to the Cruithne. From these noble women 
  sprang a line of kings that finally united with the Scots in the person of Kenneth 
  Mac Alpin in 843. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In after ages the Cruithne came to 
  be known, falsely, as Picts. The true Picts were another people altogether -- 
  an uncivilized people who painted themselves. Because the Cruithne ruled over 
  the Picts who lived in the Scottish highlands, later writers called them both 
  &quot;Picts.&quot; The wild, unsettled Picts later disappeared from Scotland. 
  Where? -- historians do not know. But Scottish history tells! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But first, to summarize the story 
  of the half-Jewish kings who descended from the Cruithnians and the Hebrew Milesian 
  women. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EARLIEST HISTORY OF SCOTLAND <br>
  The complete king list -- and an accurate chronology of all the kings of the 
  Cruithne -- has come down to us in the &quot;Pictish Chronicle.&quot; The record 
  begins with the first settlement of the Agathyrsi in 1040. That is the year 
  they were planted in Northwest Europe by Odin of Denmark, who led them out of 
  their ancient homeland in Thrace. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Pictish Chronicle&quot; 
  begins with the name of Cruithne AND SEVEN SONS, who divided the Scottish realm 
  between them. The entire period from the first migration in 1040 to the death 
  of Cruithne and his sons was 100 years. Thereafter the royal line was inherited 
  from the mother's side, not the father's, in accordance with the original agreement

  <br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EARLY LINE OF SCOTTISH KINGS <br>
  Erp is the Pictish name for the Scottish Erc. Who was this Erc? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Late Scottish historians confused 
  this Erp or Erc with Erc the father of Fearghus. Fearghus mac Erc reigned 513-529. 
  This was about a century after Drust mac Erp (or Erc). The two Ercs are not 
  the same person. This is clearly proved by all early Scottish historians. &quot;In 
  two particulars at least, none of the early writers have disagreed: that in 
  the year 503 an invasion of Caledonia took place under the leadership of Fergus 
  mac Erc, and that he and his followers had come to stay&quot; (&quot;Controversial 
  Issues in Scottish History&quot;, Gregg, page 35). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then who was the other Erc whose 
  son, a century earlier, returned to rule over the Picts? The answer is found 
  in the early history of THE SCOTS WHO MIGRATED FROM SCYTHIA IN THE YEAR 331-330. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 331 Alexander the Great overthrew 
  the Persian realm. Many nations who had been held in virtual slavery gained 
  their freedom. One of these people was the House of Israel. Israel was invaded 
  in 721 by Shalmaneser of Assyria. After a three-year siege her people were taken 
  into captivity. Ezekiel, over a century later was given a vision in which he 
  saw that the House of Israel would not be released from their enslavement until 
  390 years had elapsed from the time of the siege of Samaria (Ezekiel 4:3-5). 
  It was precisely 390 years from 721, when the siege against Samaria began, to 
  331, the date of the final overthrow of Persia and the deliverance out of captivity 
  of the Hebrews. Some of them immediately commenced a migration to the land settled 
  long before by their brethren. In the year 331-330 they journeyed out of Scythia 
  to Scotland -- THE WORD SCOTLAND ORIGINALLY MEANT THE LAND OF THE SCYTHS. In 
  Scotland they sent to Ireland for a Scythian-Mileslan prince, of the line of 
  Mileadh, to rule over them. A prince was dispatched, together with a small army. 
  His name was Fergus, the son of Ferquhard. It was his family from which Erp 
  or Erc, the father of Drust, king of the &quot;Picts,'' sprang. Before returning 
  to complete the line of &quot;Pictish&quot; kings, we shall present a summary 
  of the earliest kings to rule over the Scots in Scotland. (It should be remembered 
  that Scotland and Pictland were but two of several early divisions of that land

  EARLY HISTORY OF GERMANY<br>
  The time has come to reveal the true history of Europe. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Germans for centuries have dominated 
  the heartland of Western Europe. Because of the geographic position Germany's 
  transportation lines constitute the vital arteries of the continent. Without 
  the beating of the German heart, Europe would lose its economic and political 
  prominence in world affairs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ancient Roman writers would have 
  us believe that the Germans in the Roman heyday were mere barbarians, an insignificant 
  people roaming the forests of northern Europe. Was this Roman report the whole 
  truth? Were the ancient Roman writers keeping back from their people the facts 
  of German history? Rome conquered Spain, Gaul, Southern Britain, all North Africa 
  to the Sahara, Illyria, Greece, Asia to the Euphrates. But Rome had to draw 
  its boundary in the north along the Rhine. Why? Why was Rome not able to subdue 
  all Germany? Why, after centuries of bloodshed, did Rome finally succumb to 
  the hammer blows of the Germanic Goths and Vandals? It is high time we were 
  told the true history of early Germany. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The origin of the German people in 
  Europe is rooted in patriarchal times. The history of early Germany, suppressed 
  by the Romans, was revived briefly in the German-dominated Middle Ages. But 
  before the close of the seventeenth century not even the Germans remembered 
  their past. It had been stamped out in the name of education and religion. But 
  not all was lost. From early documents and local traditions it is still possible 
  to recover what has, in recent centuries, been buried under the rubble of modern 
  educational superstition. The Germans themselves are in great part responsible 
  for this condition. They fostered modern historical concepts. They have tried 
  to hide their past even from themselves -- just as they did at the close of 
  the Hitler era. If the Germans admitted to themselves and the world who they 
  really are, all the world would recognize IN IMPERIAL GERMANY THE REDCONSTITUTED 
  ASSYRIAN EMPIRE -- ONCE THE TERROR OFALL THE CIVILIZED WORLD! </font></p>

  Germany has set herself up as the bulwark of European civilization. Germany 
  for centuries has claimed to stand as the wall of defense against the barbarism 
  of Asia. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The German Reich long 
  endured as the oldest political institution in Continental Europe. The German 
  people called their Reich the Holy Roman Empire. It bore rule over Europe for 
  a thousand years. This &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German People&quot; was 
  officially designated by the Church in the Middle Ages as &quot;The Kingdom 
  of God&quot; on earth. Its citizens, the Germans, felt themselves true Romans 
  and bearers of the Christian Reich or kingdom. They were therefore the chosen 
  people of the Christian era, entrusted with a world-mission to be the protectors 
  of Christianity. </font></p>

  &quot;Suabi,&quot; and &quot;Quadi,&quot; the &quot;Casuri.&quot; The Romans 
  called them collectively Germani, meaning &quot;War-men&quot; (from the &quot;Encyclopedia

  from where did all these Germanic people come? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is the answer of history: &quot;There 
  can be no doubt that they came up from the Black and Caspian seas,&quot; states 
  &quot;Smith's Classical Dictionary&quot;, article, &quot;Germania,&quot; p. 
  361. Ancient historical records confirm this admission. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  Germans can be traced in historical records to the regions surrounding the Black 
  and Caspian seas, which border on the ancient Biblical Mesopotamia. This is 
  the region where civilization commenced and from where the patriarchs came! 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ANSWER FOUND <br>
  Ancient German tradition claims that their oldest city, Trier, was founded by 
  Trever or Trebeta, a son of Ninus, king of Assyria. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
  inhabitants of Trier maintain that their city is the oldest in all Europe,&quot; 
  writes Josef K. L. Bihl in his textbook &quot;In deutschen Landen&quot;, page 
  69. &quot;Trier was founded,&quot; he continues, &quot;by Trebeta, a son of 
  the famous Assyrian King Ninus. In fact, one finds ... in Trier the inscription 
  reading, 'Trier existed for 1300 years before Rome was rebuilt.' &quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ninus, 
  according to Roman, Greek and Persian records, was the first ruler who began 
  the systematic conquest of the ancient world after the death of Nimrod. He established 
  the Assyrian Empire as the chief power over Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia, 
  reported Diodorus of Sicily in his History. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But how is it possible that the oldest 
  German city, Trier, founded over 2000 years before the birth of Christ, should 
  be built by a son of Ninus, the renowned King of ancient Assyria? What connection 
  have the Germans with Assyria? Jerome, who lived at the time when the Indo-Germanic 
  tribes were invading Europe, provides this startling answer: &quot;For 'Assur 
  (the Assyrian) also is joined with them' &quot; (Letter 123, sec. 16, &quot;Nicene 
  and Post-Nicene Fathers&quot;; quote is from Psalm 83:8). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DID THE ASSYRIANS INVADE EUROPE? 
  <br>
  Yes! Jerome said so! But how did he know? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
  saw them! He was an eyewitness to their migrations from Mesopotamia and the 
  shores of the Black and Caspian seas! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now consider what Sylax, the author 
  of the &quot;Periplus,&quot; who lived about 550 B.C., writes of the southern 
  shores of the Black Sea: &quot;The coast of the Black Sea ... is called Assyria&quot; 
  (from page 261 of Perrot and Chipiez's &quot;History of Art in Sardinia, Judaea, 
  Syria and Asia Minor&quot;, Vol. II.) From there the Assyrians moved north. 
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only 300 years before Jerome, 
  the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder declared the &quot;Assyriani&quot; -- the 
  Assyrians -- were dwelling north of the Black Sea (&quot;Natural History&quot;, 
  IV, 12, page 183). But the Assyrians did not remain there. They are not there 
  today. of course not -- they migrated into Central Europe -- where the Germans 
  live today! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT DID ASSYRIANS LOOK LIKE? <br>
  What did the ancient Assyrians look like? Here is the answer: &quot;In the Zagros 
  hills and across the plain to the Tigris, there lived a ... fair-haired ... 
  people akin to the Guti (the Goths) who ... remained in what was afterwards 
  Assyria, the neighbour land to Akkad&quot; (page 5 of &quot;The Sumerians&quot;, 
  by C. Leonard Woolley). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
  the ancient Greek writers wanted to distinguish the Assyrians and their Hebrew 
  captives from the Arameans or Syrians, the Greeks often called both Assyrians 
  and their Hebrew captives &quot;Leucosyri&quot; -- meaning &quot;whites&quot; 
  or &quot;blonds&quot; as distinct from the very brunette Syrians who still live 
  in Mesopotamia. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHY GERMANS CALL THEMSELVES &quot;DEUTSCH&quot; 
  <br>
  The Germans do not call themselves &quot;German.&quot; They refer to themselves 
  as Deutschen, and to their country as Deutschland. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
  the Assyrians or Germans appeared in Europe, they claimed Tuitsch as their ancestor! 
  That is where the name &quot;Deutsch&quot; comes from! </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Tuysco, 
  the most ancient and peculiar god of all the Germans ... of this Tuisco, the 
  first and chiefest man of many among the Germans, and after whom they do call 
  themselves Tuytshen, that is, duytshes or duytsh people, I have already spoken.&quot; 
  So writes Verstegan in his 1605 publication entitled &quot;Restitution of Decayed 
  Intelligence: in Antiquities&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whenever a German calls himself Deutsch, 
  he is therefore saying he is a descendant of Tuitsch (Tuisco or Tuisto in Latin). 
  And when he terms his country Deutschland, he is saying his land is Tuitsch's 
  land. Who this Tuitsch is will be made plain in Chapter II. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT LANGUAGE DID THEY SPEAK <br>
  European scholars have thoroughly studied the language of the land of Hatti 
  -- the ancestors of the Hessians. It is an Indo-Germanic tongue -- numerous 
  words of which were akin to Old High German. So many similarities were found 
  that Edgar Sturtevant had to declare: &quot;To me it seems incredible that so 
  remarkable a situation developed in two languages independently. I feel compelled 
  to trace the Germanic ... to a common origin&quot; with the language of Hatti 
  -- common tongue of the Assyrians in Asia Minor (from &quot;A Comparative Grammar&quot;, 
  page 240). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scholars admit that for centuries 
  the language of the people who inhabited Assyria was not merely Semitic. Semitic 
  was the late literary language of Assyria -- the language of scholars, the language 
  of international commerce. Modern historians and archaeologists assume that 
  the common tongue of all Assyrian people was Semitic. They have no proof. So 
  noted an Assyriologist as Sydney Smith admitted &quot;... that the documents 
  from Asia Minor and from east of Tigris are couched in Semitic dialects spoken 
  by men unable to pronounce all the Semitic consonants ...&quot; (p. xi, from 
  &quot;Early History of Assyria to 1000 B.C.&quot;). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same circumstance occurred during 
  the Middle Ages all over Europe. The language of almost all European scholars 
  -- and even their names -- until the time of the Protestant Reformation was 
  Latin -- but Latin was not the common tongue of the people! Because most of 
  the literature of Germany was in Latin during the Middle Ages does not prove 
  that the common people spoke Latin. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SEMITIC BY RACE, NOT LANGUAGE <br>
  Asshur was a son of Shem. But after the tower of Babel, when the languages of 
  the world were confused (Genesis 11), most Assyrians no longer spoke a Semitic 
  tongue, but rather Indo-Germanic and related tongues! The Germans, therefore, 
  are Semitic by race, but not by language! </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  the days of Abraham, the Germans or Assyrians formed a great confederation of 
  states or tribes, speaking several different languages (Josephus' &quot;Antiquities 
  of the Jews&quot;, book I, ch. 9). One king of the Assyrians -- already discussed 
  -- was &quot;Tidal, king of nations&quot; (Genesis 14:1). The name Tidal is 
  Indo-Germanic, not Semitic. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most scholars have never been conscious 
  of the fact that the use of the Semitic language in Assyria was due to the rising 
  influence of the Aramaic people (Genesis 10:22) in Mesopotamia and certain of 
  the sons of Abraham (&quot;Antiquities&quot;, book I, ch. XV, sect. 1). So prominent 
  did they become that Mesopotamia is called &quot;Padan-Aram&quot; -- the plain 
  of Aram -- in the Bible (Genesis 28:22). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CHAPTER II<br>
  THE ANCIENT KINGS OF THE GERMANS<br>
  The settlement of the Assyrians and related peoples in early Europe is summarized 
  by several writers in the early Middle Ages. The list of the early kings presented 
  here is from the &quot;Bayerische Chronik&quot; and &quot;Deutsche Chronik&quot; 
  by Johannes Turmair, Abensberg, 1526. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  traditional events assigned to each ancient German ruler are confirmed by both 
  archaeological evidence and the fragmentary comments of classical historians. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Bayerische Chronik&quot; 
  is very important for the history of Central Europe. It proves that German history 
  was correctly preserved in song and poetry and in contemporary written records 
  down to Roman times. It further proves that the length of time from the Flood 
  to Roman times was accurately preserved except for an overlooked 24 years. This 
  period was the 24 years from Abram's year 75 to his year 99. The later chroniclers, 
  who placed in parallel German and Hebrew history, universally reckoned the 430 
  years from the Covenant that was confirmed with Abraham to Sinai as beginning 
  when Abram was 75 years old, instead of 99. They therefore placed the Flood 
  24 years too late in history. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  German chronicles that were the basis of Turmair's work placed the Flood 131 
  years before the coming of the German patriarch Tuisto into Europe. They should 
  have reckoned 131 plus 24 -- that is, 155 years. With this one exception, all 
  dates from Tuisto down to the burning of Rome in 390 B.C. need no correction. 
  All that is necessary is to add the separate lengths of reign. There are no 
  missing lengths of reign. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">German history commences with an 
  extensive settlement of farmers in Europe from the Don River to the Rhine. The 
  date of this migration into Europe from Mesopotamia and the Near East is placed 
  at 2214 B.C. by German history -- just 155 years after the Flood and 40 years 
  after the Tower of Babel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE EARLY SETTLERS OF EUROPE <br>
  The &quot;Bavarian Chronicle&quot; records in detail the earliest settlers of 
  Europe after the Deluge. Their encampments and habitations have been recovered 
  by archaeological research and are labeled the &quot;Neolithic&quot; migrations 
  that traversed the Danube and adjoining valleys. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shem or Tuitsch came into Europe 
  with members of his family, as well as with certain of the sons of Japheth and 
  two of the sons of Ham who were of the white stock. From these have descended 
  most of the present-day nations of Europe. The descendants of Shem include many 
  sons of Joktan, son of Heber, and a number of the sons of Mash, son of Aram. 
  The Biblical names (Genesis 10) of the grandsons and great-grandsons of Shem 
  are clearly preserved in most instances by the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. In the 
  following chart, together with the names of the patriarchal settlers, appear 
  either the areas settled, the tribes which sprang from them, or their Biblical 
  names. An historical or classical map should be consulted for location of geographic 
  names. In later times the descendants of these early heroes migrated west, south, 
  north and east under population pressure. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dukes settled by Shem in Europe Identity, 
  or Area settled <br>
  1. Sarmata, son of Joktan Settled Sarmtia; is the Hazarmaveth of Gen. 10:26; 
  colonized south Arabia; a son Tanaus gave his name to the river Tanais, now 
  called the Don. <br>
  <br>
  2. Dacus, son of Mash, grandson of Aram settled Dacia, later also colonized 
  in Denmark <br>
  <br>
  3. Geta, another son of Mash (included in Anderson's &quot;Royal Genealogies&quot;, 
  but not in &quot;Bavarian Chronicle&quot;) <br>
  from whom came certain of THE GETAE of Roman history <br>
  <br>
  4. Gotha Gether (v .23) from whom came the Goths <br>
  <br>
  5. Tibiscus, late Latin spelling of Tiobo, an Italian spelling of Jobab (Gen. 
  10:29) settled on the river Theiss or Tibiscus; descendants migrated into Germany 
  (see &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, article &quot;Archaeology&quot;) <br>
  <br>
  6. Moesa, Mash (Gen. 10:23) settled MYSIA AND MOESIA.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;(So and so) thinks that those writers are most plausible who place 
    the ARIMI (the Arimaeans) in the Catacecaumene country in MYSIA... But some 
    understand that the Syrians are ARIMI who are now called Arimaeans.&quot; 
    Strabo, Book 13.4.5-7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">_____</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Now the Greeks used to suppose that the Getae were Thracians; and the 
    Getae lived on either side of the Ister (the DANube), as did also the MYSI, 
    these also being Thracians and identical with the people who are now called 
    Moesi; from these Mysians also sprang the MYSI who now live between the Lydians 
    and the Phrygians and the Trojans. THESE PEOPLE TO BE SURE HAVE ALL UTTERLY 
    QUITTED EUROPE, but some of the MYSI have remained there.</p>
  <p>And Poseidonius seems to be correct in his conjecture that Homer designates 
    the Mysi in Europe--I mean those in Thrace-when he says: 'But back he turned 
    his shining eyes, and looked far toward the land of the horse-tending Thracians, 
    and of the Mysi, hand-to-hand fighters,' for surely, if one were to take Homer 
    to mean the Mysi in Asia, the statement would not hang together.</p>
  <p>The language of the Daci is the same as that of the Getae. (Gaelic-Hebrew). 
    Among the Greeks, however, the Getae are better known because of the migrations 
    they make to either side of the Ister...and because they are mingled among 
    the Thracians and the Mysians...</p>
  <p>The Getae and the Daci once attained to very great power, so that they could 
    actually send forth an expedition of two hundred thousand men...they now find 
    themselves close to the point of yielding obedience to the Romans. (see Antiquities 
    XII.XI.6).&quot; Strabo's Geography Book 7.3.2-13.</p>

  26) settled Dalmatia on Adriatic; 10. Jader, Jerah (v .26), his descendants

  <p>(And our author's list goes on. We will prepare to depart from him because 
    we do not believe that these Hebrew patriarchs ever existed, but that they 
    are the product of the Hebrew genius for telling a story that not only mirrors 
    human history, but provides its images and keeps it on course. The Hebrew 
    story, in all of its literary types and images, preserves the past and foretells 
    the future. Over the course of history many true-life individuals have become 
    one with the story and have kept it alive. It is now unfolding in the world 
    before our very eyes). </p>

  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KINGS OF ANCIENT GERMANY <br>
  Early Kings of German Lengths of Reign Dates <br>
  1. Tuitsch or Tuisto </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chief of thirty-two dukes. Noah gave 
  him all the land between the Don River and the Rhine or what was called Grossgermania. 
  This is the beginning of the &quot;neolithic&quot; settlement of Europe. Tuitsch 
  is, according to all ancient German commentaries and chronicles, a son of Noah. 
  But which son? Noah adopted Tuitsch's children as his own. The ancient Germans 
  understood the name Tuitsch to be the title &quot;Teacher.&quot; He was therefore 
  the great patriarch of his family who taught the divine will to his children. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tuitsch is the father of Mannus (who 
  is the Assyrian Ninus). The son of Mannus, Trebeta, is the same man who is called 
  the son of Ninus in classical writers. The son of Mannus or Ninus -- Trebeta 
  -- built Trier, the first town of Germany. Since the Bible calls this Ninus 
  (who built Nineveh), Asshur, Tuitsch is therefore Shem! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tuitsch (Shem) left Europe for Egypt 
  in 2038. His appearance in Egyptian chronological records of Dynasty I dates 
  his arrival and government in 2037. From Armenia Tuitsch left 155 years after 
  the Flood (131 plus 24) -- see the comments at the beginning of this chapter. 
  With him were twenty-two descendants plus eight from Japheth and two from Ham. 
  Tuitsch made his headquarters at Deutz (today Koeln-Deutz). The country is called 
  Deutschland after him -- that is, the land of the great Patriarch or Teacher, 
  Shem. In the 25th year of his reign (2190-2189) Tuitsch held a state assembly, 
  divided lands among his descendants and ordained laws. He also brought more 
  colonies from Mesopotamia. 176, 2214-2038 </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the last 60 years of Tuitsch's 
  or Shem's reign in Germany, he governed his family from Egypt and Italy. It 
  was not until 1978 that Mannus assumed the government over Western Europe, succeeding 
  his father Tuitsch. At the beginning of his reign he sends out colonies to France 
  and Asia Minor. His son Herman establishes the kingdoms of Phrygia, Mysia and 
  Bithynia in Mannus' 34th year (1945-1944). Another son Trieber or Trebeta, built 
  Trier. Nerus, another son, settled in the Netherlands. This Mannus is the Assyrian 
  Ninus and is Asshur, son of Shem. Asshur means &quot;strength&quot; in Hebrew 
  and has the same sense as Mannus -- masculinity -- in German. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This son of Mannus or Ninus -- Asshur 
  -- was the German Mercury. His wife Freia was the German Venus. He instituted 
  the observance of Weinnachten of December 24. Eingeb is responsible for settling 
  Germans on the North Sea from Denmark to Dunkirk. He sent his general Brigus 
  from the Danube valley to secure Spain against the African Amazons (female warriors). 
  Myrein, queen of the African Amazons advanced up the Danube but was defeated 
  and slain by Eingeb's generals Seiphyl and Mopser. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Ausstaeb or Istaevon. Son of Eingeb, 
  Ausstaeb was the German Mars. From him are descended the Rheinlanders. In his 
  days a great drought devastated Italy. <br>
  <br>
  Herman, Son of Ausstaeb. He taught the philosophy that war and to die in battle 
  is most pleasing to God. He introduced the arts of warmaking to the Germans. 
  The Druids began to flourish in Germany. Herman settled the heart of Germany, 
  whose people were called Hermanduri or Hermiones after him. 1820-1757 <br>
  <br>
  Mers, Son of Herman. The city of Merseburg is named after him. The Dithmarsii 
  descended from him. Oryz, the Egyptian god-king Osiris, came with his wife Eisen 
  up the Danube valley to Mers. They left Germany and went to Italy on their way 
  back to Egypt. Cultural development of Germany through contact with Egypt in 
  days of Joseph -- beer making, agriculture, forging and medicine were brought 
  to Germany. <br>
  Son of Alman. He sent a great army of Germans and Wends from Germany, Denmark 
  and Gothland to the Balkans. One group, the Goths under Gebreich and Vilmer, 
  settled on the river Theissa and lived there as the Getae till the time of Valentinian. 
  Another group, including the German Amazons, proceeded down the Danube valley 
  to the Black Sea and on through the Crimea and the Palus Maeotis to Armenia 
  and Cappadocia and the Taurus mountains. Here they were known as the Cimmerians. 
  Baier was also known as Bojus of Bavaria since he was the ancestor of many Bavari. 
  He built Prague. 1489-1429 <br>
  <br>
  13. Ingram or Ingramus Son of Baier. He sent many German colonists to Asia Minor. 
  Tanhauser, king of the Germans in Asia Minor, and his priestess Schmirein, led 
  a conquering army through Syria as far as Egypt. Built Hermenia, afterwards 
  called Reginoberg (Ratisbon). 1429-1377 <br>
  <br>
  15. Larein, Son of Adalger. This is the Laertes of Trojan fame, mentioned by 
  the Roman historian Tacitus. During his rule an army set out from Germany and 
  went via Poland and Ruthenia to the Danube valley. Here it was joined by Germans 
  who had come to the area some 150 years earlier, and the combined forces fell 
  into Asia Minor under their leader Mader and their queen Aloph. They passed 
  through Phrygia and settled in Armenia. 1328-1277 <br>
  <br>
  16. Ylsing or Ulsing, Son of Larein. This is the Trojan Ulysses of Tacitus. 
  He is also the Greek Odysseus who sailed out to the Atlantic and up to the Rhine. 
  Built Emmerick on the Main. During his reign the Germans under Galter again 
  invaded Asia Minor and settled on the banks of the river Sangarius. Priam of 
  Troy tried in vain to expel them, finally made a treaty, and they later helped 
  him against the Greeks. 1277-1224 <br>
  <br>
  18. Heccar (Hykar or Highter), Son of Brenner. He is the famous Hector of the 
  First Trojan War. He was of great help to Priam. Teutschram, king of the Germans 
  of Transylvania and son-in-law of Priam also sent help. 1186-1155 <br>
  <br>
  Frank (Francus or Franco) Son of Heccar. From him descended the German Franks 
  or Franconians. In his days Amar, queen of the German Amazons, burned the temple 
  in Ephesus. 1155-1114 <br>
  <br>
  31. Schirm, Son of Brenner III. He and his son Brenner IV ruled until 60 years 
  after death of Alexander -- although Brenner IV dies earlier. Brenner led a 
  massive German invasion into Greece, plundered Macedonia and the oracle at Delphi, 
  but was killed in 279 B.C. 361-263 <br>
  <br>
  33. Dieth I , Son of Thessel, ruled jointly with his son Diethmer. Diethmer 
  invaded Palestine on behalf of Antiochus IV, took many Jews captive and settled 
  them in Germany near Regensburg. Soon afterwards Hannibal attacked Italy and 
  many of the Bavarians from Northern Italy joined him against Rome. After Hannibal's 
  defeat there followed a war between the Romans and Bavarians in northern Italy 
  which lasted 12 years. Finally, weary of fighting, the Bavarians left Italy, 
  where they had dwelt for almost 400 years, and settled in Pannonia. Dieth was 
  also driven from Italy, whereupon Diethmer, in retaliation, persuaded Philip 
  V of Macedon to renew his hostilities with Rome. Entz and Olor, German kings 
  in Istria and Transylvania, aided Philip, but Rome won. In Asia Minor Rome launched 
  an attack against the German kings Orthjag, Gompelmer, G&#132;udhor, Orgsgund 
  and Eposgnad. These retreated eastward over the Halys, where they were defeated, 
  sued for peace, and swore never to raid foreign nations again. The Romans also 
  defeated king Entz of Istria. 194-172 <br>
  <br>
  35. Boiger, Kels and Teutenbuecher, They ruled jointly over the Germans and 
  Bavarians in 127 B.C. They gathered an army of 300,000 Saxons and Bavarians, 
  intending to invade and resettle Italy, from which they had been driven some 
  70 years earlier. They were, however, defeated by Marius at Aquae Sextiae (102 
  B.C.) and Vercellae (101 B.C.). Boiger died, having reigned 27 years. <br>
  <br>
  36. Scheirer, Mithridates tried to enlist his aid in the struggles against Rome. 
  <br>
  <br>
  37. Ernst (Arionistus) and Vocho, Ernst was king over Germany and France, his 
  brother-in-law, Vocho, over Bavaria, Austria and Hungary. Ernst invaded France, 
  fought there for 14 years, and settled it with 120,000 Germans. Next 33,000 
  Bavarians decided to go via France and Spain into Italy. They were joined by 
  the Helvetti. Julius Caesar defeated them, sent the Helvetii back home, but 
  allowed the Bavarians to settle in Burgundy. Caesar also defeated king Ernst. 
  70-50 <br>
  <br>
  38. Pernpeist, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He made a treaty 
  with Persia against the Romans, made raids into Greece and even attacked Apulia 
  and Naples by sea. The Bavarians, having been driven from Italy, lived near 
  the Drave and Danube for 127 years. In the times of Ernst and Pernpeist they 
  left their homes, sailed down the Danube and settled near the Vistula, Dniester 
  and Dnieper, where they remained some 550 years. The name of the Bavarians is 
  not encountered again for some 500 years, till the time of Attila. 50-40 <br>
  <br>
  </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 13 B.C. Augustus made an attack 
  against the Germans on the Danube. Later he settled 40,000 Westphalians, Hessians 
  and Schwaben on the west bank of the Rhine. Virtual anarchy now began to reign 
  among the German tribes. There were anti-Roman and pro-Roman factions and these 
  split whole tribes and even families. The ruling families soon killed each other 
  off in family feuds and inter-tribal warfare. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  royal house that next dominated Germany came from the Sicambrian Franks.</font></p>
