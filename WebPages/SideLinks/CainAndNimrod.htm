<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE TWO SPIRITS IN 
  MAN</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is for the one 
    who would bring others to the inner vision, so that they may understand and 
    teach to all the children of Light the real nature of men, touching the different 
    varieties of temperaments with the distinguishing traits thereof, touching 
    their actions throughout their generations, and touching the reason why they 
    are now visited with afflictions and now enjoy periods of well-being.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All that is and ever 
    was comes from a God of knowledge. Before things came into existence He determined 
    the plan of them; and when they fill their appointed roles, it is in accordance 
    with His glorious design that they discharge their functions. Nothing can 
    be changed. In His hand lies the government of all things. God it is that 
    sustains them in their needs.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now this God created 
    man to rule the world, and appointed him two spirits after whose direction 
    he was to walk until the final inquisition. They are the spirits of Truth 
    and Perversity.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The origin of Truth 
    lies in the Foundation of Light, and that of Perversity in the Wellspring 
    of Darkness. All who practice righteousness are under the dominion of the 
    Prince of Lights, and walk in the ways of light; whereas all who practice 
    perversity are under the dominion of the Angel of Darkness, however, even 
    those who practice righteousness are made liable to error. All their sins 
    and iniquities, all their guilt and their deeds of transgression are the result 
    of his dominion; And this, BY GOD'S INSCRUTABLE DESIGN, will continue until 
    the time appointed by Him. Moreover, all men's afflictions and all their moments 
    of tribulation are due to this being's malevolent sway. All the spirits that 
    attend upon him are bent on causing the children of light to stumble. How 
    be it, the God of Israel and the Angel of His Truth are always there to help 
    the children of Light. It is God that created these spirits of Light and Darkness, 
    and made them the basis of every act, the instigators of every deed and the 
    directors of every thought. The one He loves to all eternity, and is ever 
    pleased with its deeds; but any association with the other He abhors, and 
    He hates all its ways until the end of time.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the way those 
    spirits operate in the world. The enlightenment of man's heart, the making 
    straight before him all the ways of righteousness and truth, the implanting 
    in his heart of fear for the judgments of God, of a spirit of humility, of 
    patience, of abundant compassion, of perpetual goodness, of insight, of perception, 
    of that sense of the Divine Power that is based at once on an apprehension 
    of God's work and a reliance on His plenteous mercy, of the spirit of knowledge 
    informing every plan of action, of a zeal for righteous government, of a hallowed 
    mind in a controlled nature, of abounding love for all who follow the truth, 
    of a self-respecting purity which abhors all the taint of filth, of a modesty 
    of behavior coupled with a general prudence and an ability to hide within 
    oneself the secrets of what one knows--these are the things that come to those 
    in the world through communion with the spirit of truth...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But to the spirit 
    of perversity belong greed, remissness in right-doing, wickedness and falsehood, 
    pride and presumption, ruthless deception and guile, abundant insolence, shortness 
    of temper and profusion of folly, arrogant passion, and abominable acts...a 
    blasphemous tongue, blindness of eyes, dullness of ears, stiffness of neck 
    and hardness of heart, to the end that a man walks entirely in the ways of 
    Darkness and evil cunning. The guerdon of all who walk in such ways is multitude 
    of afflictions at the hands of the angels of destruction...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is to these things 
    that all men are born, and it is to these that all the host of them are heirs 
    throughout their generations. It is in these ways that men needs must walk 
    and it is in these two divisions, according as a man inherits something of 
    each, that all human acts are divided throughout all the ages of eternity. 
    For God has appointed these two things to obtain in equal measure until the 
    final age...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Howbeit, God in His 
    inscrutable wisdom has appointed a term for the existence of perversity, and 
    when the time of Inquisition comes, He will destroy it forever. Then Truth 
    will emerge triumphant in the world... </font>The Manual of Discipline, The

    and because she hopes to become something that contradicts her nature, she 
    destroys what she has. Pretending to make sacrifices, she stains herself with 
    blood at the time of her menses, and thus pollutes those who touch her. When 
    she conceives she gives birth to temporary kings and brings about wars in

    has a two-fold meaning; for it is interpreted both &quot;possession&quot; 
    and &quot;envy&quot; and indicates that later he was to envy his brother Abel 
    a woman, or a possession, or the love of his parents. But if it was none of 
    these, then it was well ordered that he should be called &quot;Possession,&quot; 
    for he was her first possession that was profitable for her...For he was a 
    murderer and a liar and did not wish to cease from sin once he had begun to 
    do so. Moreover his descendents were the first adulterers. They made harps
