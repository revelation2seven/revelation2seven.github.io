<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neocons Admit They&#146;ve 
  Blown It &#150; Is The Draft Next?<br>
  By Paul Craig Roberts</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  August 28, 200 </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you remember the ridicule neocons 
  heaped on critics who predicted a quagmire in Iraq? Now neocons William Kristol 
  and Robert Kagan are calling for more troops and more money - two more army 
  divisions and another $60 billion to be exact. &#147;Next spring, if disaster 
  looms,&#148; they write, &#147;it may be too late.&#148; [Do What It Takes in 
  Iraq Weekly Standard, by William Kristol and Robert Kagan, September 01, 2003] 
  John McCain, who experienced, but has forgotten, the Vietnam quagmire has taken 
  the bait and is urging Bush to send more troops. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But there are no troops to send. 
  The Pentagon doesn&#146;t know where it is going to get the troops to carry 
  on the occupation of Iraq at the present level of troop strength. The Associated 
  Press reports that our combat troops are going to be saddled with back-to-back 
  assignments to overseas hotspots. Army officials are concerned that they are 
  going to begin losing many sergeants and junior officers. Officers in infantry 
  divisions are scrambling to find other military jobs that are not subject to 
  overseas deployment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, the handful of neocons 
  who got our country into this growing mess are still talking about the U.S. 
  invading other Middle Eastern countries as part of their program to deracinate 
  Islam. On top of it all, neocons want to take on North Korea, whose army outnumbers 
  ours two to one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush is trying to get other countries 
  to send their soldiers to occupy Iraq. So far success has eluded him. Other 
  countries don&#146;t like to tell us &#147;no&#148; repeatedly. They say they 
  have to have the cover of the UN, which the neocons intended to keep out. The 
  UN would likely get in the way of the neocons&#146; plan to use Iraq as a staging 
  ground for invading Iran, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush, however, is getting desperate. 
  As our soldiers are pushed off the streets of Iraq and congregate behind hopefully 
  impenetrable barricades, Bush might have to let the UN rescue him on its own 
  terms. The UN should not do so, however, without a firm understanding that it 
  is not freeing up US troops for an attack on another Middle Eastern country.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you think about it, you will realize 
  that the neocons&#146; war plans are taking us back to the draft. There&#146;s 
  no way around it. Lacking sufficient military forces to occupy Iraq with its 
  small population of 25 million, what would we do once neocons get us mired down 
  in Iran or Egypt with their large populations? Somebody needs to call a halt 
  to this. It will not be the neocon press or Fox News that does it. These folks 
  hide behind superpatriotism, but their real motive is to make the Middle East 
  safe for Israel. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The alliance of neocons with white 
  southern evangelicals is not enough to control US foreign policy. Sooner or 
  later even the brain-dead are going to realize that Iraq had no weapons of mass 
  destruction, was not a threat to us (until neocons got us mired down there), 
  and had nothing to do with the events of September 11. We spent a fortune attacking 
  a country that had done us no harm, killing tens of thousands of its people, 
  and giving the US a black eye as an aggressor that starts wars on the basis 
  of lies and disinformation. In the process, we also wrecked the political standing 
  of our best ally, British PM Tony Blair. Two-thirds of the British people now 
  believe that Blair intentionally made a false case for invading Iraq.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the public tires of flag-waving 
  and war propaganda, how will the Bush administration carry on with its pretense 
  that we have made the world safe from terrorists by overthrowing Saddam Hussein? 
  Voters will begin to wonder why Bush doesn&#146;t sack the neocons who have 
  brought him such deep embarrassment. The longer Bush waits before sacking the 
  neocons, the more voters will wonder why they voted for Bush.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our situation in Iraq is already 
  bad. It will become untenable if the Shiite majority decides to join in the 
  effort to drive us out. It doesn&#146;t appear we will be able to buy off our 
  adversaries with our money. Will we as a proud nation respond to Iraqi resistance 
  by conscripting our sons and grandsons as targets for terrorists and guerillas? 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While we are bogged down, what happens 
  if something hits the fan in another part of the world? Will we be forced to 
  resort to nuclear weapons? Many people much smarter than neocons gave these 
  warnings in response to the neocons&#146; promise of &#147;cakewalk.&#148; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is time Bush replaced his delusional 
  neocon advisors with wise people of integrity. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AMERICAN POLITICIANS 
  CALLING FOR MORE TROOPS</font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON, Sept 1 (AFP) - Less 
  than six months after starting the Iraq war, the US administration is battling 
  to shore up confidence in its ability to rebuild the country and its military 
  strategy. Though polls indicate Americans still support the campaign to bring 
  down Saddam Hussein, daily attacks on US targets, and their supporters are starting 
  to eat into backing for President George W. Bush's Iraq policy. Opposition Democrat 
  leaders are starting to talk of &quot;quagmire.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anti-American slogans shouted by 
  crowds in Iraq after the latest car bomb, that killed 85 people in the holy 
  city of Najaf, will no doubt unnerve the US public even more. Bush insisted 
  again last week that the United States will stay the course in Iraq though he 
  admitted it will be hard and sacrifices will have to be made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The administration has said there 
  are no plans to add to the 140,000 US troops in Iraq but the failure to get 
  other countries to help the stabilization effort has only added to US problems. 
  Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage expressed strong frustration at Japan's 
  intention to postpone sending troops to Iraq during recent talks with a top 
  Japanese envoy in Washington, Japan's Kyodo News agency reported. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The much-watched US opinion polls 
  indicate the public would be willing to hand over control of Iraq to the United 
  Nations. Sixty-nine percent of respondents in a CBS News survey released Friday 
  said the United Nations should take the lead in rebuilding Iraq. Just 25 percent 
  said the United States should remain in charge. Forty-seven percent of those 
  surveyed said events in Iraq are slipping out of US control compared with 42 
  percent who believed the US remains firmly in control.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Kerry, one of the nine Democrat 
  presidential contenders, called Sunday for greater efforts to persuade other 
  countries to send troops to Iraq. &quot;We are in danger, if we don't do what 
  we need to do in the next months, of having an enormous quagmire, of having 
  a very serious challenge,&quot; he told CBS television. Kerry said UN help must 
  be sought. &quot;We must internationalize this effort, we have to reduce the 
  sense of American occupation, we have to take the target off of American troops.&quot; 
  He also called for increasing spending on Iraq &quot;by whatever number of billions 
  of dollars it takes to win.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John McCain, an influential Republican 
  senator, wrote in the Washington Post that &quot;our military force levels are 
  obviously inadequate&quot; in Iraq. But he opposed handing over authority to 
  the United Nations. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, has floated the 
  idea of having a UN force with a US general in charge. But even that causes 
  nerves within the administration, experts said. General John Abizaid, the new 
  head of the US Central Command, whose responsibility includes Iraq and Afghanistan, 
  said a greater international participation was needed to end Iraqi fears that 
  they were living under a US occupation. But he has also reinforced the need 
  for better intelligence on the threat from followers of ousted Iraqi leader 
  Saddam Hussein and the foreign fighters that US officials say have entered the 
  country.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not all experts agree extra numbers 
  are needed. Anthony Cordesman, a military specialist with the Center for Strategic 
  and International Studies in Washington said: &quot;The key to winning in this 
  offensive is not numbers, but intelligence, skilled cadres of expert troops, 
  area of language specialists, mixed with constant civic action and political 
  warfare to win hearts and minds.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="center"><b>THE DRAFT: A CALL TO DECISIVENESS</b></p>

  <br>
  The cheers of the moment are not what a man ought to think about, but the verdict 
  of his conscience. - Woodrow Wilson</p>
<p>Veterans Day was cold and rainy in my hometown this year. But it wasn&#146;t 
  just the weather that dampened parades. It was also the nagging thought that 
  though the holiday honors those who fought in past wars, the ongoing conflict 
  in US-occupied Iraq is currently turning out the largest new wave of combat 
  veterans since Vietnam. </p>
<p>&#147;Do not do what your conscience condemns, and do not say what does not 
  agree with truth. Let no one coerce your will; let it be accessible neither 
  to thief nor robber...The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, 
  but to escape finding yourself in the ranks of the insane.&#148; Marcus Aurelius</p>
<p>Equally sobering were two articles I read on November 11, a date originally 
  set to commemorate the end of armed hostilities. One carried the headline, &#147;Talk 
  of a Draft Grows Despite Denials by White House.&#148; The other reported on 
  the 7,500 U.S. soldiers that have been wounded in action since April&#151;and 
  are now flooding military hospitals like Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 
  Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>As a counselor I have talked with veterans of every major war in the last century. 
  I have looked into their haunted eyes and listened to their stories. Personally, 
  I am adamantly opposed to armed force. I belong to a peace church that has consistently 
  spoken out against violence for 450 years. Still, I sometimes wonder whether 
  it wouldn&#146;t be a blessing for today&#146;s youth to be faced with a military 
  draft, <b>as long as provisions are made for conscientious objectors</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Our 
  author lacks Prophetic Sight)</font>.</p>
<p>My generation (I became a teen during the McCarthy era) came of age when opposition 
  to war cost something. My peers and I had to decide to either join the military 
  or to volunteer for alternative service. No matter what we chose, in a sense 
  we all saw combat: not one of us could evade the battle that takes place inside 
  when one is faced with such a question. At that time most Americans had no trouble 
  accepting a draft: they saw the fight against communism as a conflict between 
  good and evil. A recent immigrant and a child of refugees from Nazi Germany, 
  I cherished my adoptive country&#146;s freedoms. <b>But having been brought 
  up to follow the teachings of Jesus, I was also convinced that killing people 
  can never be right.</b></p>
<p>Most people I knew did not look kindly on such a view. Though many understood 
  how one&#146;s faith might prevent one from signing up, many more saw conscientious 
  objectors as draft dodgers and cowards, and hated them for it. <b>But I knew 
  what my faith demanded, and that I must honor it.</b> Looking back, I feel that 
  deciding to do so strengthened me.</p>
<p>That&#146;s why I believe it could be healthy for today&#146;s youth to face 
  a similar choice. Deciding which side to stand on is one of life&#146;s vital 
  skills. It forces you to test your own convictions&#151;to assess your personal 
  integrity and your character as an individual. Each of us knows right from wrong, 
  but we often lack the courage to act on that knowledge. How many of us are secretly 
  troubled&#151;if not outraged&#151;by the atrocities that are being committed 
  in the name of the &quot;war on terror&quot;? How many of us feel isolated and 
  insecure but are too afraid to speak out?</p>
<p><b>If the White House and the Congress decide to reinstate mandatory military 
  service, maybe it will sober us and our nation's young.</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  (1 Thessalonians 5)</font>. For too long we have taken our freedoms and comforts 
  for granted. We have failed to appreciate our high standard of living, and forgotten 
  the millions who live in grinding poverty. But if the war in Iraq is any indication, 
  harder times are on the horizon. Perhaps they will help us realize that survival 
  does not depend on material things. It depends on one's relationship with God 
  and with one's neighbor.</p>
<p><b>Hard times could also remind us that there is a power far greater than military 
  might. It is the power of love and forgiveness, which will ultimately lead all 
  peoples together. Love, not armed force, is the only power that will bring healing 
  and peace, especially to those injured and maimed by war, and to those who have 
  lost loved ones&#151;men and women who were willing to pay the ultimate price.</b></p>
<p><b>A draft would present every young person with a choice between two paths, 
  both of which require equal courage: to heed the recruiter's call and be rushed 
  off to war, or to say, &#147;No. I will give my life only in the service of 
  peace.&#148; It is for God to decide which is more patriotic.</b></p>
