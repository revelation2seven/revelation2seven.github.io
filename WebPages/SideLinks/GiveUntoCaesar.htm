<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants 
      to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto unto death, 
      or of obedience unto righteousness. </font></i><font size="+1"><i>YIELD 
      NOT YOUR MEMBERS AS INSTRUMENTS OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</i>...(Romans 6:12-16).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">This is the place to take a closer look at the words <i>Give 
  Unto Caesar</i>. It is a favorite quotation of the prophets of Ba'al. The various 
  churches under their sway have wrapped this saying around themselves and the 
  people like a set of chains. They think it says &quot;Give unto Caesar the things 
  that are Caesar's,&quot; and to this unholy misconception they offer themselves 
  and their children. The Lord's groanings vibrate in our ears as we hear the 
  people declaring what they have been told he said. They teach other, saying 
  &quot;we must give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's&quot;. But what 
  he said to them, &quot;as he perceived their wickedness,&quot; was &quot;WHY 
  TEMPT ME YE HYPOCRITES?&quot; (Luke 20:21-26; Matthew 22:17-26...KJV).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">They asked if it was lawful to render unto Caesar, even though 
  the commandments NOT to do so were already contained in the Scriptures. It is 
  written: <i>The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, the world, and 
  they that dwell therein. </i>(Psalm 24:1). Caesar himself does not belong to 
  Caesar, so why would God give us to him? Does God enslave the Spirit to the 
  flesh? Well, yes, but only in the sense that every spirit is born into a body 
  of flesh, and only in the sense that God sent Israel down to Egypt--but this 
  so that the people might learn, not only how to overcome the Darkness, but why. 
  The ruler was created by God to fulfill all the ordinances of Darkness:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same 
    purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my Power in thee, and that 
    my Name might be declared throughout all the earth...</font></i><font size="+1">(Romans 
    9:17).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Now who is Pharaoh but Caesar? And who is Caesar but a king? 
  And who is a king but a president? And how did God show His Power in Pharaoh? 
  By destroying him and all his host, and drowning them beneath the sea. As a 
  people who have come to a full age, we ask, &quot;Why would God give His people 
  over to a power that He himself has purposed to destroy? </font></p>

<p align="center"><b> For the Mystery of Iniquity doth already work...2 Thessalonians 
  2:7-12; Malachi, chapter 4....(KJV).</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Caesar is ordained by God to instruct the children of Light 
  in the ways of Darkness. He and Pharaoh are one, even as the children of this 
  world are one with the mind that rules over the lower order. God created the 
  lower order, first of all, in order to reveal ourselves to ourselves, and then, 
  that He might reveal Himself and how it is that He rises up against the powers 
  of the earth in the form of opposing powers; and how He will rise up again to 
  destroy any future attempt to duplicate the forms of political and economic 
  evils that have been demonstrated to the world throughout this course of recorded 
  history. Pharaoh, or Caesar, (or the Papacy), or a President, all of these sit 
  as chiefs over the lower order:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">But...you hath he quickened who were dead in trespass 
    and sins, wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of this 
    world, according to </font></i><font size="+1"><i>the Prince of the Power 
    of the Air</i></font><i><font size="+1">, the spirit that now worketh in the 
    children of disobedience...</font></i><font size="+1"> (Ephesians 2:2).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For ye were sometimes Darkness, but now are ye light in 
    the Lord: walk as the children of Light...AND HAVE NO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE 
    UNFRUITFUL WORKS OF DARKNESS</font></i><font size="+1">, <i>but rather reprove 
    them..</i> (Ephesians 5:8, 11; Matthew 7:16-20).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The World-ruler is called the Prince of the Power of the Air 
  because he is so intricately connected to the course of the Mystery of Christ 
  which has been on an epic flight across history, from the rising of the Sun 
  in the East (out of ancient Egypt) to the setting of the Sun here in the West 
  (in America). It is understood in the words: <i>Ye have seen what I did unto 
  the Egyptians, and how I bare you on Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself. 
  </i>(Exodus 19:4-6; 1 Thess.4:16-18). Thus Paul, always looking toward the fulness 
  of time, also says: <i>For the Mystery of Iniquity doth already work. </i>(2 
  Thess. 2:1-12).</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg138a.gif" width="527" height="237"></p>
<p align="center"><b>The realm of EGYPT, where also Our Lord was crucified...Revelation 
  11:8</b> </p>
<p><font size="+1">The architects of the American government, who are referred 
  to by the American church as &quot;Our Founding Fathers,&quot; after they seized 
  upon this land, were also compelled by God--when they were considering a design 
  for the national seal--to engrave upon the national consciousness this very 
  episode of Israel's epic flight from the lower realm. Thomas Jefferson, after 
  describing the obverse side of how he thought the seal should be inscribed, 
  said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;On the other side of the Great Seal should be the following device: 
    Pharaoh sitting in an open chariot, a crown on his head, and a sword in his 
    Right Hand, passing through the divided waters of the Red Sea, in pursuit 
    of the Israelites. Rays from a pillar of Fire in the Cloud, expressive of 
    the Divine Presence and Command, beaming on Moses, who stands of the shore, 
    and extending his hand over the sea, causes it to overthrow Pharaoh.</b></p>
  <p><b>Motto, 'Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.'&quot;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Of course Jefferson could not have had any idea in his time 
  that the words in Genesis 15:7-16 were referring to the people's spiritual captivity 
  in America in these last times, or to events that would unfold at the end of 
  the 20th century. Neither did Congress; it selected another instead, depicting 
  the Great Eagle itself. With both Olive Branches and Arrows held in its talons 
  it reflects the words: <i>Let them grow together until the harvest. </i>(Matthew 
  13:30).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The early Church (those who understood the mysteries) already 
  knew the fate of Caesar and the Roman empire:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all 
    the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn 
    their backs to thee.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And I will send hornets </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(humans 
    with the spirits of hornets in them)</font><i><font size="+1"> before thee, 
    and shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before 
    thee.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, 
    lest the land become desolate and the beast of the field multiply against 
    thee.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">By little and little will I drive them out from before 
    thee, until thou be increased and inherit the land...</font></i></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>THOU SHALT MAKE NO COVENANTS WITH THEM, NOR WITH THEIR 
    GODS.</i> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(This means, with 
    their Caesars, their popes, their kings, or their presidents, and especially 
    when these take the Name of Jesus Christ in their mouths without walking in 
    the precepts of Christ themselves. In which case even Jesus Christ becomes 
    a false god)</font>.</p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">They shall not dwell in thy land </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(and 
    because the true Israel is not allowed to occupy any land on earth, the text 
    means: They shall not dwell in thy heart or in thy mind)</font><font size="+1"><i>, 
    lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods it will surely 
    be a snare unto thee...</i>(Exodus 23:27-33; Luke 21:35).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It is also written: <i>The Lord will punish the host of the 
  High ones that are in high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. </i>(Isaiah 
  24:21), and, <i>He shall cut off the spirit of princes. He is terrible to the 
  kings of the earth. </i>(Psalm 76:12). So when they asked him to expound the 
  doctrine of the &quot;slavery of Kings&quot;</font> <font size="+1">he could 
  see that they were trying to ensnare him in his words. Had he expounded it clearly 
  it would have been at the expense of the entire epic. (Matthew 13:10-15). It 
  was not time yet. The sons of Darkness would have refrained from doing what 
  was naturally in their hearts to do: sit on thrones, or declare war on Austria 
  as Woodrow Wilson was fated to in 1917. They would have been able to &quot;act&quot; 
  differently, refraining from power and thus fully deceiving the children of 
  Light. They would have been able to slip into the-age-to-come with the children 
  of the Kingdom, appearing to be of the same spirit. Not knowing who they were, 
  and unable to distinguish their lofty rhetoric and smooth-sounding words from 
  the truth, they would soon come to power again in the same manner as they came 
  to power in this age of Darkness, and the whole cycle of judgments would begin 
  again. Therefore God laid a snare for them. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is written...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, 
    prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for ALL men.</font></i></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>FOR kings, and ALL that are in authority, THAT THEY MAY 
    LEAD A QUIET AND PEACEABLE LIFE IN GOODNESS AND HONESTY</i>...(1 Timothy 2:1,2).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...but the apostate church, having made its pacts with the 
  lower world, and having added to the context of Paul's words, now finds itself 
  praying, not &quot;FOR&quot; Caesar, or the President, but &quot;WITH&quot; 
  him, becoming in turn his priests and prophets--the prophets of Ba'al. And what 
  do these World-leaders pray for? For God to be quiet and peaceable, so that 
  their own earthly authority may continue. Therefore, with the words in his heart 
  that say...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"></font><i><font size="+1">Evil men understand not judgment, 
    but they that seek the Lord understand all things...</font></i><font size="+1">(Proverbs 
    28:4,5).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...he said to them, &quot;Show me a coin.&quot; Seeing the 
  image of <i>their</i> god imprinted on it--knowing it would not be so for those 
  who have endeared themselves to the whole of God's teachings--he gave them permission 
  to do what was already in their hearts to do...even as it was said of them in 
  1776, &quot;The revolution was in the hearts and minds of the people.&quot; 
  (Open the pages of the Book of Isaiah at the time of the American and French 
  revolutions, and understand 1 Peter, chapter 2 at the same time). Therefore 
  it is also written: <i>And they could not take hold of his words. </i>(Luke 
  20:26).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest 
    thou unto them in parables?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto 
    you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not 
    given...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore I speak unto them in parables: because they 
    seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which 
    saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall 
    see, and shall not perceive:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears 
    are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they 
    should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand 
    with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears 
    for they hear.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous 
    men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; 
    and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Hear ye therefore the parable of the Sower...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew 
    13:10-18; Isaiah 6:9-110).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">He wished they could have come close enough to be instructed. 
  He would have told them that nothing belongs to Caesar, save our compassion 
  for him, and our knowledge of his great anointing from heaven. He is not our 
  enemy until he attempts to draw us down into his realm, to fight his wars, or 
  to stand up for him in his defense against God. Then he must be resisted. God 
  has commissioned him to make an attempt on our souls, so that we could be instructed 
  in the ways of Holy warfare. The Zealots too: if they would have listened, they 
  would have learned that we do not have to storm Caesar's gates because God has 
  already promised to throw them down for us. We simply go in and out liberating 
  souls from his domain, and if he catches us, willingly suffering the consequences, 
  and the death if need be as it has been revealed to us. Such a death leads to 
  LIFE.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Nor do we bind ourselves to laws of Caesar's kingdom, especially 
  when they are in violation of our own: <i>After the doings of the land of Canaan 
  whither I bring you shall ye not do. NEITHER SHALL THOU WALK IN THEIR ORDINANCES. 
  </i>(Leviticus 19:5). When the first Church aligned itself to the nations round 
  about it God said: <i>They have built the high places of Ba'al...WHICH I COMMANDED 
  NOT, NOR SPAKE IT, NEITHER CAME IT INTO MY MIND. </i>(Jeremiah 19:5). This means 
  that we are not commanded, nor did God ever instruct us to obey the laws of 
  this world...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But neither are we commanded to disobey the laws of men, when 
  they are not in violation of God's laws. We are commanded to walk above them. 
  And this because the highest legislative capabilities of men merely touch the 
  lower wisdom of Heaven's laws. And because every thing good in man's laws is 
  already contained in God's laws, to walk in them (even in the simplest precepts 
  of men) is to come down from the heavenly places wherein we already dwell in 
  Christ; and to break what is truly good in man's law is to have already transgressed 
  the commandments of God. This, because the constitutions of men, their canons 
  and their declarations, are all out of harmony with the just and radical requirements 
  of God. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Keep therefore and do them; for this is your Wisdom and 
    your Understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear of these 
    statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a Wise and Understanding people.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For what (other) nation is so great, who hath God so near 
    unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Them for?</font></i></p>

    lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart
