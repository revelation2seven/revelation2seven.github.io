    <b>REAL-LIFE RAIDERS HUNT ARK OF THE COVENANT</b></p>
  <p>Relic searchers dig near Jesus' crucifixion site in quest for chest holding 
    10 Commandments </p>
</div>
<p align="center">By Joe Kovacs</p>
<p><b>For centuries, many have wondered whatever happened to the Ark of the Covenant, 
  the box the Bible says contained the Ten Commandments of God. Now, a new quest 
  is underway for the legendary chest featured in the film &quot;Raiders of the 
  Lost Ark,&quot; trying to prove the claim the Ark is buried below the purported 
  site where Jesus Christ was crucified. </b></p>

<p>An international team has just completed what it calls its first stage of exploration, 
  spending two weeks <b>beneath Mount Moriah outside the walls of ancient Jerusalem</b>. 
  Some 30 explorers from the U.S., Australia, Norway and Estonia have been in 
  a cave system north of the city's Damascus Gate to try to determine if the Ark 
  is indeed located there. </p>
<p>The group is trying to verify the claim made by relic hunter Ron Wyatt who 
  said he actually saw the Ark there two decades ago after tunneling through a 
  small passageway. Wyatt died of cancer in 1999 after years of searching for 
  biblical antiquities, claiming to have found Noah's Ark near Mount Ararat in 
  Turkey, <b>the remains of Pharaoh's chariots that chased Moses through the Red 
  Sea, and the &quot;true&quot; location of Mount Sinai in Arabia.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>&quot;I just want to know the truth, whatever it is,&quot;</b> 
  says Richard Rives, president of Wyatt Archaeological Research in Cornersville, 
  Tenn., which is spearheading the latest effort. </p>
<p>While members of his group are not archaeologists by trade &#150; they're doctors, 
  nurses, structural and construction engineers, and businessmen &#150; they are 
  teaming with professional archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority, 
  which has sanctioned the dig.In 1982, Wyatt entered the caves from a location 
  since sealed, <b>but believed there was an alternate passageway used by the 
  prophet Jeremiah to protect the Ark from invading Babylonians some 600 years 
  before the birth of Christ</b>. Ironically, during his Ark quest 21 years ago, 
  Wyatt and his crew decided to take a break and go to the movies. Unaware of 
  what was playing, they were surprised to see <b>&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot;</b> 
  which had just been released. </p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">It is also found in the records that Jeremy the prophet 
    commanded them that were carried away (to Babylon) to take of the Fire, as 
    it hath been signified.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And how that the prophet, having given them the law, charged 
    them not to forget the commandments of the Lord, and that they should not 
    err in their minds, when they see images of silver and gold, with their ornaments.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And with other such speeches exhorted he them, that the 
    law should not depart from their hearts.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet, 
    being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, 
    as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up and saw the heritage 
    of God.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And when Jeremy came thither, he found an hollow cave, 
    wherein he laid the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and 
    so stopped the door.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And some of those that followed him came to mark the way, 
    but they could not find it.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Which when Jeremy perceived, he blamed them, saying, As 
    for that place, it shall be unknown until the time that God gather his people 
    again together, and receive them unto mercy.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then shall the Lord shew them these things, and the glory 
    of the Lord shall appear, and the Cloud also, as it was shewed under Moses, 
    and as when Solomon desired that place be honourably sanctified.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">It was also declared, that he being wise offered the sacrifice 
    of dedication, and of the finishing of the Temple.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And as when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the Fire came 
    down from heaven, and consumed the sacrifices: even so prayed Solomon also,

<p>This summer's research team used ground-penetrating radar to peer below the 
  surface, trying to pinpoint the alleged tunnel of Jeremiah. Rives believes they 
  met great success while taking samples behind a man-made wall. (wyattmuseum.com). 
  &quot;We found a void where Ron said there would be a passageway,&quot; Rives 
  said. It's at the end of that passageway where Wyatt believed the sacred container 
  rests. </p>
<p>But once the diggers started excavating beneath the wall, they encountered 
  a problem forcing a halt to the hunt. &quot;We lost our ceiling to prevent collapse,&quot; 
  Rives said. &quot;The people in the antiquities department insisted we stop 
  and do more architectural engineering to determine what it would take to continue 
  safely.&quot; The group is now studying the situation with experts and hopes 
  to be back in business within the next six months. </p>
<p>This latest search effort reignites debate over whether or not the Ark is even 
  located there, since many theories have sprouted concerning the container's 
  whereabouts. <b>Some claim it's currently in Ethiopia, having been brought there 
  after a visit to Solomon's Temple by the ancient Queen of Sheba</b>. Others 
  have suggested the box is hidden in Spain, Canada, Elephantine Island in Egypt, 
  the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm <b>and even somewhere in America</b> near 
  Utah. </p>
<p>The Bible's final mention of the Ark recounts King Josiah's order to return 
  the chest to the temple: Put the Holy Ark in the house which Solomon the son 
  of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders. 
  (2 Chronicles 35:3).</p>
<p>Spiros Zodhiates, editor of the Hebrew-Greek Key Word Study Bible, expounds 
  on the Ark's possible fate subsequent to that verse. <b>&quot;It may have been 
  carried away by [Babylonian King] Nebuchadnezzar along with the other saved 
  articles, when he plundered the temple,&quot;</b> Zodhiates writes. &quot;Since 
  no reference is made to the Ark by Ezra, Nehemiah or even [Roman historian] 
  Josephus after the capitivity, it is believed that there was no Ark in the second 
  temple and that the Holy of Holies [where the Ark was situated in the temple] 
  stood empty.&quot; </p>
<p>Biblical scholar and modern-day relic hunter Mike Sanders, who has gained notoriety 
  with his Biblical Mysteries programs, believes the original Ark was destroyed 
  by a different pagan king, and a replica was constructed to replace it. &quot;The 
  Ark was certainly taken by the Egyptian King Shishak,&quot; Sanders told WorldNetDaily. 
  &quot;There were obviously subsequent copies made as there were of all the other 
  temple accoutrements which were also looted many times over the centuries. This 
  has enabled the myth makers to come up with many wild and wonderful scenarios.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Sanders believes the Ark's contents &#150; the stone tablets etched by God 
  with the Ten Commandments &#150; are located in the foundation deposit of an 
  Egyptian temple he discovered in the Judean hills. &quot;Hopefully we will extract 
  the contents live on the Internet and on television sometime early next year 
  when the situation in Israel is somewhat safer,&quot; he says. </p>
<p>Sanders is among those critical of Wyatt's assertions about the Ark. &quot;When 
  he was alive, I spent some time asking him questions and asking for evidence 
  [regarding] his claims. None was ever forthcoming to me or anyone else,&quot; 
  Sanders said. &quot;In those areas where I have done some investigations, he 
  has proven to be a charlatan.&quot; Just days before his death, Wyatt granted 
  an interview to WorldNetDaily, and addressed such criticism from his detractors. 
</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing [that] can be done to prevent ridicule that I'm aware 
  of,&quot; Wyatt said. &quot;I don't think it would be appropriate to deny people 
  the opportunity of using ridicule because I think that's part of showing their 
  true character.&quot; During the interview, Wyatt explained he found an earthquake 
  crack directly below the place where the wood on which Jesus was crucified would 
  have been. The cleft extends down through the rock to the resting place of the 
  Mercy Seat representing God's throne atop the Ark of the Covenant. The blood 
  of Christ would have flowed through that crevice after his death and after his 
  side had been pierced by a soldier's spear. </p>
<p> The Bible teaches the concept of sacrifice of animals, symbolic of the actual 
  blood sacrifice Christ would make. The act of Christ, regarded by some as the 
  great High Priest, permitting himself to be sacrificed and placing his own blood 
  upon the Mercy Seat was <b>the great and final act in the process of blood sacrifice</b>, 
  according to Wyatt's writings. And while Wyatt believed the Ark itself would 
  never be moved from its current location, he thought the laws of God inside 
  it would eventually be removed and put on display as a testimony to the world. 
</p>
<p>&quot;This last revelation is for the inhabitants of the Earth who don't have 
  a clue, as well as for those of us who do have a clue and have been commissioned 
  by Christ to reach out to help bring these people who don't have a clue into 
  the fold,&quot; Wyatt told WorldNetDaily. &quot;So these are tools that God 
  has given the believers to strengthen their faith and to reach out with. They 
  are tools that will be extremely effective in these the last pouring out to 
  the entire population, all inhabitants of the Earth.&quot; </p>
<p>Rives says from a biblical standpoint, it makes perfect sense the Ark would 
  be located where Wyatt claimed <b>and be covered with Christ's own blood</b>. 
  &quot;What's important about the Ark is what's inside of it &#150; the Ten Commandments, 
  the Covenant,&quot; said Rives. </p>
<p>While many people talk about sin in the modern world, Rives points out the 
  Bible defines sin as breaking the law recorded on the tablets inside the Ark. 
  &quot;For sin is the transgression of the law.&quot; (1 John 3:4) &quot;The 
  first four Commandments teach us who our Creator is and how he wants us to worship 
  Him,&quot; said Rives. &quot;There's an adversary, Satan. He wants to be God 
  if he can get us to break those first four Commandments. Many aspects of religion 
  today are in violation of the first four Commandments.&quot; </p>
