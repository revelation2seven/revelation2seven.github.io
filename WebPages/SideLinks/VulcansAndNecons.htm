<p align="center"><b>RISE OF THE VULCANS<br>
  The History of Bush's War Cabinet<br>
  By James Mann<br>
  </b> </p>
<p align="center"> <br>
  <b>A REVIEW BY MICHIKO KAKUTANI</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>The Vulcans in James Mann's compelling new book are not the 
  ultra-logical pointy-eared beings from &quot;Star Trek,&quot; but the Pentagon-trained 
  pro-military foreign policy advisers who surround President Bush. THEIR NICKNAME, 
  WHICH THEY COINED DURING THE 2000 CAMPAIGN, CAME FROM THE ROMAN GOD OF FIRE 
  AND THE FORGE, and was meant, Mr. Mann says, to convey a sense of &quot;power, 
  toughness, resilience and durability.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Mann's real subject in this book is the United States' evolving relationship 
  with the world over the past three decades, as American power rose from a nadir 
  at the end of the Vietnam War to a position of military supremacy. The prism 
  he uses to examine this subject consists of THE BELIEFS AND EXPERIENCES OF SIX 
  LEADING VULCANS: VICE PRESIDENT DICH CHENEY, DEFENSE SECRETARY DONALD H. RUMSFELD; 
  DEPUTY DEFENSE SECRETARY PAUL WOLFOWITZ; SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN L. POWELL; 
  DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE RICAHRD ARMITAGE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER 
  CONDOLEEZA RICE.</b></p>

<p><b>The resulting book is lucid, shrewd and, after so many high-decibel screeds 
  from both the right and left, blessedly level-headed. It is necessary reading 
  for anyone interested in understanding the back story of how and why America 
  came to deal with the rest of the world the way it is doing under the Bush administration.</b></p>
<p><b>Although much of the information is familiar from newspapers and policy 
  documents, Mr. Mann &#151; a former correspondent for The Los Angeles Times 
  &#151; does an impressive job of pulling it all together and connecting a multitude 
  of dots. He explicates the complex legacy of such watershed events as Vietnam, 
  Iran-contra and the first gulf war, while at the same time showing how crisscrossing 
  alliances and rivalries among the Vulcans in earlier Republican administrations 
  informed the debates and the decisions surrounding the war in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>Despite serious disagreements that emerged between Mr. Powell and Mr. Armitage 
  at State, and Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Wolfowitz at the Pentagon, Mr. Mann argues, 
  larger shared assumptions tie the Vulcans together. THESE ARE A BELIEF IN THE 
  IMPORTANCE OF AMERICAN MILITARY POWER, A FOCUS ON TRADITIONAL NATIONAL SECURITY 
  ISSUES (as opposed to, say, international economic concerns), A BELIEF THAT 
  &quot;AMERICAN POWER AND IDEALS ARE, ON A WHOLE, A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD: 
  AND AN OPTIMISM ABOUT AMERICA'S ABILITIES AND ITS FUTURE. </b></p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Some of the Bush administration's policy decisions, this book suggests, 
  were fed by temperamental differences among the Vulcans and by internal decision-making 
  dynamics. Mr. Mann describes Mr. Powell as a problem solver and pragmatist, 
  not given to big-picture thinking, and chides him for failing to put forth a 
  compelling alternative to Mr. Wolfowitz's vision of America as an unchallengeable 
  superpower or to Ms. Rice's National Security Strategy with its doctrine of 
  pre-emption. </b></p>
<p><b>He also observes that bureaucratic warfare between the Pentagon and the 
  State Department meant that the White House was regularly called upon to resolve 
  disputes, further enhancing Mr. Cheney's already substantial leverage and power. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Mann charts the permutations and flip-flops in neoconservative thinking 
  over the years, underscoring how the cause of democracy and self-determination 
  overseas went from being a largely liberal, Democratic idea (looked upon with 
  suspicion by conservatives like Jeane J. Kirkpatrick in the late 1970's) to 
  a fiercely held axiom of the Bush administration.</b></p>
<p><b>He similarly charts the sea change that the thinking of some Vulcans underwent 
  over the years, ALTHOUGH HE DOES NOT ALWAYS MANAGE TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHY THOSE 
  CHANGES CAME ABOUT. For instance he points out that Ms. Rice evolved from being 
  a pragmatist (in the tradition of Henry A. Kissinger and her mentor Brent Scowcroft) 
  to being &quot;the prime mover behind the drafting of a new National Security 
  Strategy that laid the framework for a preventive war.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>In addition Mr. Mann reminds us how policies, frequently presented by the 
  Bush administration as responses to a post-9/11 world, had roots in long-standing 
  neoconservative theories and propositions: from the push by many Vulcans for 
  a more assertive, moralistic stance toward the Soviet Union in the 1970's and 
  80's, to a hawkish 1992 Defense Planning Guidance paper, which was drafted by 
  Mr. Wolfowitz's office, sponsored by the defense secretary at the time, Dick 
  Cheney, but turned aside by the White House of the current president's father...</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg481-482.gif" width="750" height="650"></p>
<p><b>For Mr. Mann, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 &quot;greatly accelerated&quot; 
  the willingness of the current administration &quot;to rethink cold war ideas 
  about national security&quot; &#151; namely, containment, deterrence and multilateral 
  approaches to foreign policy &#151; and persuaded the Vulcans that &quot;America 
  had entered a new era and needed new concepts to guide it.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>In the ensuing months, he observes, the administration would abandon the 
  ABM Treaty, move away from cold war strategies of deterrence, recast America's 
  stand on nuclear weapons, turn the war on terror into a campaign against weapons 
  of mass destruction and reshape American approaches to Israel and the Palestinians. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>The decision to invade Iraq last year, Mr. Mann writes, &quot;encapsulated 
  virtually all the key elements in the Vulcans' views of the world&quot; and 
  &quot;reflected the foreign policy ideas and themes that the Vulcans had gradually 
  developed over the previous three decades.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>Writing in clear, authoritative prose, Mr. Mann provides a coolly nonpartisan 
  assessment of these developments. He argues that while Democratic leaders often 
  accused the Republicans of unilateralism, &quot;the truth was that the Clinton 
  administration too gave far less weight to principles of collective security 
  than had America's leaders from the 1940's through the 1980's.&quot; On the 
  other hand, he points out that after the war in Iraq ended, &quot;many of the 
  forecasts of the hawks proved inaccurate,&quot; from their assertions about 
  weapons of mass destruction to their predictions of a welcoming Iraqi nation.</b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Mann wants to treat the Vulcans as a singular and historically important 
  group, like THE WISE MEN, WHO SHAPED AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AT THE END OF WORLD 
  WAR II, OR THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST WHO PROSECUTED THE VIETNAM WAR IN THE 
  1960's. </b></p>
<p><b>Unfortunately this premise sometimes goads him into playing down the serious 
  schisms that developed among the Vulcans and also results, at the book's very 
  end, in a highly dubious generalization, that &quot;during the 35 years FROM 
  1968 THROUGH 2003, THE VULCANS REFLECTED THE MOODS AND BELIEFS OF AMERICA AS 
  A WHOLE.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>But such reductive asides are rare in this book, which not only shows how 
  the personal experiences of individual Vulcans shaped &quot;the choices they 
  made after taking office in 2001 and after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,&quot; 
  but also delivers A MEASURED AND KEENLY ANALYTIC ACCOUNT OFHOW THE VULCANS AS 
  A GROUP TRIED TO PROMOTE THEIR AUDACIOUS AND PROBLEMATIC VISION OF AMERICA AS 
  AN UNCHALLENGEABLE BEHEMOTH, &quot;WHOSE MILITARY POWER WAS SO AWESOME THAT 
  IT NOT LONGER NEEDED TO MAKE COMPROMISES OR ACCOMODATIONS (unless it chose to 
  do so) WITH ANY OTHER NATION OR GROUPS OF COUNTRIES.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE
