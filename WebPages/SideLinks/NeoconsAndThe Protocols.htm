<P align=center>HOW TO TALK ABOUT ISRAEL</P>
<P align=center>By IAN BURUMA</P>
<P align=center>August 31, 2003</P>
<P><BR>
  The Jewish Problem pops up in the strangest places. In the winter of 1991, at 
  the height of the first gulf war, I asked a right-wing Japanese politician who 
  still wields considerable power in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to explain 
  the Japanese role in the Middle Eastern conflict. After clearing his throat 
  with some perfunctory remarks about oil supplies and United States-Japan relations, 
  he suddenly stopped midsentence, gave me a shrewd look and said: ''Look, we 
  Japanese aren't stupid. We saw Henry Kissinger on TV. We know how America operates. 
  We're perfectly well aware that this war is not about Kuwait. It's about Jewish 
  interests. It's all about Israel.'' </P>
<P>Perhaps he had read too many books about Jewish conspiracies (Roosevelt was 
  a Jew, Churchill was a Jew, Rockefeller was a Jew, etc.), for which the Japanese 
  market seems to have an insatiable appetite. He was, in any case, not known 
  for his intellectual finesse. BUT THE IDEA THAT ISRAEL OR JEWISH INTERESTS ARE 
  SOMEHOW AT THE CENTER OF WORLD EVENTS, OR at the very least, at the center of 
  American foreign policy in the Middle East is widely held, and not only outside 
  the United States. No matter what the current American administration does to 
  save the tattered ''ROAD MAP'' toward an end to the conflict between Israelis 
  and Palestinians, sinister motives are still bound to be imputed. </P>
<P align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac4.gif" width="650" height="472"></P>
<P align="center"><b>They are very much at the Center of World Events. They ARE 
  the Center of World Events.</b></P>
<P>Earlier this year, Representative James Moran, a Democrat, said that ''if it 
  were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, 
  we would not be doing this.'' In Britain, Tam Dalyell, a longstanding Labor 
  member of Parliament, expressed a similar view. Tony Blair, he opined, was listening 
  too much to A 'CABALl'' OF JEWS AROUND PRESIDENT BUSH that included Deputy Defense 
  Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; an under secretary of defense, Douglas Feith; Richard 
  Perle, a member of the Defense Policy Board; Elliott Abrams, director of Middle 
  East Affairs in the White House; and the former presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer. 
  ''Those people drive this policy,'' Dalyell said. Dalyell was ''worried about 
  my country being led up the garden path on a Likudnik-Sharon agenda'' by British 
  Jews close to Blair. He included among them Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, a 
  Christian, whose rather distant Jewish family connections are very unlikely 
  to make him a Likudnik. </P>
<P>The fact that James Moran had to apologize immediately, while the British M.P. 
  was under no compulsion to do so, shows a profound difference between the United 
  States and Europe, or indeed anywhere else in the world. Although Moran's opinion 
  may be shared by other Americans, it is not something mainstream politicians 
  can vocalize. Even legitimate criticism of Israel, or of Zionism, is often quickly 
  denounced as anti-Semitism by various watchdogs. In European political discourse, 
  not only is anti-Zionism quite acceptable, but so are vague allegations of too 
  much Jewish influence in public life, especially across the Atlantic. And in 
  the non-Western world, it's not even necessary to keep such allegations vague. 
</P>
<P>Rarely can such a tiny country as Israel, and such a relatively small minority 
  as the diaspora Jews, have been assumed to exercise so much influence in world 
  affairs. THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES, and 
  the supposed dominance of ''Jewish interests'' in Washington, is by now encrusted 
  with so many layers of mythology and bad faith that it has become very difficult 
  to discuss Israel's role in American politics critically and dispassionately. 
  Yet not to talk about it invites only more conspiracy theories. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)</font>...</P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)</font>...There are several 
  myths to be considered. The first is the idea that the American or the British 
  government is dominated or manipulated by Jews. In fact, none of President Bush's 
  cabinet members are Jewish, and the last time individual Jews played a prominent 
  part in any British government was under John Major. Straw, moreover, has spent 
  more time and energy courting Iran than Israel. The well-being of Israel is 
  not Blair's main concern either. In fact, an equitable deal for the Palestinians 
  is more important to the British leader, who badly needs to rebuild his bridges 
  with other European governments. That is why he wants Washington to push the 
  Israelis harder to make peace with the Palestinians. </P>
<P>There is no doubt that Israeli lobby groups are well organized and well financed 
  and have considerable clout in Washington. But then so do other lobbies. That 
  is how the game is played. There was a time not so long ago when hefty books 
  were written about the United States government falling into the hands of scheming 
  Japanese lobbies. It is true that some people in the Pentagon, as well as influential 
  organizations like the AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE and the PROJECT FOR A NEW 
  AMERICAN CENTURY, have close relations with the Likud Party, and especially 
  with Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is much more in tune with AMERICAN 
  NEOCONSERVATISM than Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is. Douglas Feith and Richard 
  Perle advised Netanyahu, who was prime minister in 1996, to make ''a clean break'' 
  from the Oslo accords with the Palestinians. They also argued that Israeli security 
  would be served best by regime change in surrounding countries. Despite the 
  current mess in Iraq, this is still a commonplace in Washington. In Paul Wolfowitz's 
  words, ''The road to peace in the Middle East goes through Baghdad.'' It has 
  indeed become an article of faith (literally in some cases) in Washington that 
  American and Israeli interests are identical, but this was not always so, and 
  ''Jewish interests'' are not the main reason for it now. </P>
<P>Indeed, Israel enjoys a zealous following among some gentiles, PARTICULARLY 
  CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALISTS. (In electoral terms, Christian fundamentalists are 
  more important to the Republican Party than Jews -- there are many more of them. 
  The Christian Coalition is highly efficient and most Jews still vote for the 
  Democrats anyway.) Even though Israel is often described as the only democracy 
  in the Middle East, the Christian right's remarkable devotion to Israel is not 
  necessarily driven by democratic principles. The ''Christian Zionists'' are 
  convinced BY A LITERAL READING OF THE BIBLE that Christ will reappear only once 
  the Jews HAVE REPOSSESSED THE HOLY LAND...</P>

<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: 
    for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it 
    be told you...</font></i><font size="+1">(Habakkuk 1:5; Acts 13:40,41 KJV)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<P>...Their other conviction, that Jews will either die in an apocalypse or be 
  converted to Christianity, is not so reassuring. Still, the Rev. Jerry Falwell 
  declared on ''60 Minutes'' that evangelical Christians would make sure no American 
  president would ever do anything to harm Israel. At a conference of the Christian 
  Coalition held in Washington last year, there were more Stars of David than 
  crucifixes. </P>
<P>Then there are the FOREIGN POLICY HAWKS for whom Israel has been a strategic 
  inspiration. The notions of ''pre-emptive'' war and ''regime change'' were exemplified, 
  if not exactly pioneered, by Israel. The Six-Day War of 1967 was launched by 
  Israel in self-protection, admittedly in the face of far greater provocation 
  than Iraq ever gave the United States. And the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 was 
  part of an Israeli effort to install a more friendly government in Beirut. Both 
  actions, deplored by critics of Israel all over the world, were seen as marks 
  of admirable resolve by friends of Israel in the United States. </P>
<P>WHAT WE SEE, THEN, IS NOT A JEWISH CONSPIRACY, BUT A PECULIAR ALLIANCE OF EVANGELICAL 
  CHRISTIANS, FOREIGN-POLICY HARD-LINERS, LOBBYISTS FOR THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT 
  AND NEOCONSERVATIVES, a number of whom happen to be Jewish. But the Jews among 
  them -- Perle, Wolfowitz, William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, et 
  al. -- are more likely to speak about freedom and democracy than about Halakha 
  (Jewish law). What unites this alliance of convenience IS A SHARED VISION OF 
  AMERICAN DESTINY and the conviction that American force and a tough Israeli 
  line on the Arabs are the best ways to make the United States strong, Israel 
  safe and the world a better place...</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden 
    destruction shall come upon them, as travail upon a Woman with child, and 
    they shall not escape...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Thessalonians 5:1-9).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<P>Not all Americans agree with this hard line, to be sure: a recent campaign 
  by American Jews to press Sharon into accepting a two-state solution shows this. 
  In fact, he now accepts it in principle. Whether he will comply with American 
  pressure to stop building a barrier to keep the Palestinians more or less imprisoned 
  inside the occupied territories is doubtful, especially when Palestinian suicide 
  bombers continue to blow up buses -- and the Israeli government continues to 
  kill Hamas leaders. And there is no sign that President Bush will make a serious 
  effort to make the Israelis dismantle, or at least stop building, Jewish settlements 
  in Palesitinian areas.. THE IDEA THAT ISRAELI AND AMERICAN INTERESTS, AS DEFINED 
  BY EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS, NEOCONS AND LIKUDNIKS, CONVERGE, AS IF BY FORCE OF 
  NATURE, is not seriously challenged in the United States. </P>
<P>To judge from much of the world's media, especially in Europe and the Middle 
  East, this was always true. In fact, it was not. The turning point was the Six-Day 
  War. It was then that many Europeans took up the Palestinian cause and Israel 
  could count, for the first time, on the almost unconditional support of the 
  United States. In 1947, President Harry S. Truman did join the Soviet Union 
  in backing the United Nations resolution THAT GAVE JEWS THE RIGHT TO FOUND A 
  STATE IN PALESTINE. But he did so against the advice of State Department officials, 
  who worried about antagonizing the oil-rich Arab nations. When Israelis fought 
  for the survival of their state in 1948, the United States did nothing to help 
  them. Both the Americans and the Soviets would later have good reasons for discretion 
  about their respective attitudes AT ISRAEL'S DIFFICULT BIRTH... </P>

</blockquote>
<P>...In 1956, during the Suez crisis, the United States actively opposed Israel's 
  interests. It was an interesting little war in light of today's fashionable 
  cliches about dovish anti-Zionist Europeans and hawkish pro-Israeli Americans. 
  Israel's biggest supporter and arms supplier in the 1950's was not the United 
  States, but France. That is how Israel got its nuclear bomb. Britain was more 
  ambivalent and tended to lean toward the Arabs. But when President Gamal Abdel 
  Nasser of Egypt, often depicted in the European press as an Arab Hitler, nationalized 
  the Suez Canal, thus cutting out the British and French corporate owners, the 
  British joined the French in an attempt to grab it back. They enlisted the Israelis 
  in this enterprise by encouraging them to attack Egyptian ''terrorists'' in 
  the Sinai, after which Britain and France would order both sides to withdraw 
  from Suez. The inevitable Egyptian refusal would then be followed by a short, 
  sharp conflict and possibly even a ''regime change'' in Cairo. All went well 
  until the Soviets threatened to intervene on behalf of the Egyptians and President 
  Dwight D. Eisenhower forced France and Britain to back off and the Israelis 
  to get out of the Sinai. </P>
<P>The French remained Israel's staunchest allies until 1967, when Gen. Charles 
  de Gaulle decided to withdraw his favors. Having only just divested France of 
  its last colonial possessions in North Africa, de Gaulle decided to cultivate 
  the Arabs. He called the Israelis a ''domineering'' people and warned them against 
  going to war. As he put it to the Israeli foreign minister, Abba Eban: ''You 
  will be considered the aggressor by the world, and by me. You will cause the 
  Soviet Union to penetrate more deeply into the Middle East, and Israel will 
  suffer the consequences. You will create a Palestinian nationalism, and you 
  will never get rid of it.'' De Gaulle was not totally wrong on any of these 
  counts. </P>
<P>Until 1967, Israel was a great liberal European cause. Almost everyone on the 
  left supported it. The promised land of kibbutzim and open-shirted pioneers 
  represented, after all, a socialist dream. Conservatives supported Israel, too, 
  especially the type of people who thought that Jews were all very well as long 
  as they stuck to their own kind. This attitude was not new. Arthur Balfour, 
  the British foreign secretary whose famous declaration in 1917 opened Palestine 
  to Jewish immigration, was against Jewish immigration to Britain and told Chaim 
  Weizmann, the Zionist leader, that he shared the ''anti-Semitic postulates'' 
  of certain well-known Jew-baiters. </P>
<P>Guilt, too, had a great deal to do with European good will toward Israel in 
  the 50's and early 60's. This was a time when Jewish characters in German novels 
  took on a saintly air and anti-Semitic remarks (in public) were treated as a 
  kind of blasphemy. Anti-Semitism didn't disappear, of course, but open expressions 
  of it were frowned upon, at least in Western Europe. If the word ''Jew'' had 
  to be uttered at all, people lowered their voices, as if embarrassed by the 
  very sound of it. Britain, never having been under Nazi occupation, was less 
  vexed. Having grown up in guilt-ridden Holland, I can remember how shocked I 
  was, sometime in the mid-60's, to hear a young lawyer in London make disparaging 
  remarks about Jews. </P>
<P>Philo-Semitism is better than pogroms, to be sure, but there was something 
  unreal, and even a little unsettling, about this dutiful sense of collective 
  guilt. It was as if Jews, including Israeli Jews, once again were not treated 
  in the same way as other human beings, which can quickly lead to resentment, 
  not among Jews so much as among gentiles. Zvi Rex, an Israeli psychoanalyst, 
  once put his finger right on this sorest of points. ''The Germans,'' he said, 
  ''will never forgive the Jews for Auschwitz.'' This harsh analysis applies to 
  some extent to non-Jews all over the European continent. Nobody likes to be 
  made to feel guilty, especially for the sins of his father. </P>
<P>So it was with a certain sense of relief, in the aftermath of the 1967 war, 
  that the European left, led by Communist publications like L'Humanite in France, 
  could point its finger at Israelis AND CONCLUDE THAT JEWS, FAR FROM BEING SAINTLY, 
  WERE BEHAVING JUST AS BADLY AS EVERYONE ELSE AND, INDEED, PERHAPS WORSE. Once 
  it became clear that the Israelis were not going to give back their conquered 
  territories, the Palestinians became the prime victims to be protected from 
  persecution, and the Jews became the Nazis. Here is L'Humanite on July 20, 1967: 
  ''Six million Jews were not slaughtered by the Nazis so that young sabras could 
  on occasion behave like young Hitlerites.''</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even 
    as the Lord my God commanded me, that you should do so in the land (in the 
    State of Mind) whither ye go to possess it.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Keep therefore and do them: for this is your Wisdom and 
    your Understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear of these 
    statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a Wise and Understanding people...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 
    4:5,6). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<P>...In fact, Europeans, especially on the left, had a double guilt complex. 
  One complex concerned the widespread collaboration in the destruction of European 
  Jewry; the other was about the colonial past. France's war in Algeria ended 
  only in 1962, after eight years of torture, terrorism and a near civil war in 
  France. Israel had backed France in this last stand for European colonial rule. 
  Taking up the cause of Palestinians, Vietnamese and other postcolonial peoples 
  fighting for their ''liberation'' was a way to atone for past European sins. 
  And because Western imperialism, since the late 60's, was largely associated 
  with Israel and the United States, ANTI-ZIONISM AND ANTI-AMERICANISM CAME TO 
  MEAN THE SAME THING. In this respect, if in little else, the editors of L'Humanite 
  and General de Gaulle were entirely on the same wavelength.</P>

  <p><b>The United States and Israel are both Zionists states. Both have the same 
    sense of their own existence, and have made the same mutual claims to being 
    <i>Manifest Israel. </i>And this because both nations lie on the same plain 
    of historical events as the other.</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<P>...THE UNITED STATES, meanwhile, BEGAN SUPPLYING ISRAEL WITH FIGHTER JETS in 
  1968 and became an ever more reliable friend. But Zionist lobbies were not the 
  main reason. It was the politics of the cold war that paved Washington's road 
  to Jerusalem. Even though President Lyndon Johnson liked the macho Israelis, 
  some of his closest advisers, including Vietnam hawks like Secretary of State 
  Dean Rusk and Walt Rostow, a national security adviser, argued against supporting 
  Israel's 1967 war. But Johnson decided that the United States had to stand by 
  Israel to thwart Soviet designs on the Middle East. </P>
<P>If American Jews had anything to do with this, it was because many of them 
  criticized the war in Vietnam, and Johnson needed something to appease these 
  loyal Democratic voters. Since Israel, by then, was becoming a primary focus 
  of Jewish identification -- AS RELIGION, YIDDISH AND OLD WORLD MEMORIES WERE 
  FADING. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)</font><b>... </b></P>

<p><font size="+1">Statement by Dr.Thomas Klestil, Federal President of the Republic

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Distinguished Guests, Ladies and 
    Gentlemen,</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT IS THE TIME SPAN OF OUR RECOLLECTIONS? 
    WHAT PERIODS OF THE PAST CAN WE STILL REACH WITH OUR KNOWLEDGE, OUR THOUGHTS 
    AND OUR FEELINGS? DO THE NARRATIONS AND JUDGMENTS OF OUR ANCESTORS STILL REACH 
    US? CAN WE STILL READ FROM THE STONES OF EARLIER TIMES? And another question: 
    how long do times past last? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have gathered here in a place 
    where we face the checkered history of our country in a very special way, 
    and which relates to us stories of suffering and joy, of supreme cultural 
    achievements and unfathomable hatred. Here, on Vienna's Judenplatz Square, 
    IT ALSO BECOMES VISIBLE THAT THE PAST AND THE PRESENT ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO 
    ONE ANOTHER; here we come to realize that it is only on the basis of the past, 
    which we cannot change anymore, that we can create a better future. THIS IS 
    WHAT HISTORY TEACHES US. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We, Austrians, like to of think 
    of ourselves as the successors and bearers of a great cultural tradition that 
    - to this very day - enables us to achieve great accomplishments in this field. 
    But if something applies to the bright side in our country, SHOULDN'T IT ALSO 
    APPLY TO THE DARK SIDE AS IT? Shouldn't we, as heirs and successors, also 
    face up to the tremendous barbarity of our history?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me briefly illustrate this 
    ambivalence in our history: Here, on Vienna's Judenplatz Square, stands the 
    house where Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote his opera &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot;, 
    with Lorenzo da Ponte, his librettist, who was the son of a Jewish craftsman 
    from Venetia, coming to see him frequently in house number four. Here, on 
    Vienna's Judenplatz Square, many Jews gathered for their common prayers, as 
    early as the late Middle Ages. However, we also find here evidence for many 
    centuries of hatred against the local Jewish population. We are standing now 
    on the foundations of that synagogue where, more than 500 years ago, the repeatedly 
    flaring phases of expulsion, persecution and killings of Jews in Vienna culminated 
    in their desperate act of self-conflagration. And we come to realize that 
    - here again - THERE IS A LONG CHAIN OF INTERACTION AND INVOLVEMENT WHICH 
    WE MUST ACCEPT, IN SORROW AND WITH HUMILITY, AS PART OF OUR HISTORY, AND WHICH 
    RUNS THROUGH THE CENTURIES LIKE A STIGMA. (Like a Stigmata)? However, we must 
    KNOW in order to be able to ACKNOWLEDGE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, on Vienna's Judenplatz Square, 
    you also see a statue of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, the German poet, whose 
    &quot;Ring Parable&quot; has remained alive to this day, as a forceful symbol 
    for tolerance. For us, a plea attaches to his person, namely that - time and 
    again - we must find the strength to actively and courageously stand up for 
    tolerance and to accept those who are different and are strangers. Here, on 
    Judenplatz Square, finally, we will unveil a memorial today, which is dedicated 
    TO THOSE AUSTRIAN JEWS WHO BECAME THE VICTIMS OF THE GREATEST INHUMANITY OF 
    THE PAST CENTURY. If I use the expression inhumanity this is, in fact, not 
    correct. After all, human beings devised, planned and consistently implemented 
    this virtually industrial extermination of millions of their fellow men and 
    women. There were many Austrians among those who let the flame of hatred burn 
    so high in their hearts as only human beings are capable of admitting. And 
    they were human beings &#150; acquaintances, colleagues, neighbours, or even 
    friends who were prepared, or had been moved, for the most diverse motives, 
    TO TAKE PART IN THE GREATEST CRIME THAT HAS EVER BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST THE 
    JEWISH PEOPLE: THE SHOA.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...If we have come here today to 
    unveil the memorial that Rachel Whiteread, the British artist, has designed 
    and which seems fit - like no other monument - to describe that which cannot 
    be described, then we must also admit that many Austrians share in the blame 
    of having committed the crimes of the Nazi regime. And we must also insist 
    and demand anew THAT WE MUST REJECT AND FIGHT AGAINST ANY FIRST SIGN OF ANTI-SEMITISM 
    AND RACISM IN AUSTRIA TODAY. There is no way around it, nor any looking to 
    the side. There must be no compromise, nor concession.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same holds true when addressing 
    the question of returning expropriated belongings to deportees or their descendants, 
    or of finding the best possible way to compensate them for the injustices 
    that they have suffered. Austria adopted restitution laws which stipulate 
    that the Government must take the iniative and examine ownership relations. 
    Austria's federal museums and art galleries have already returned to their 
    lawful owners a great many works of art which were unjustly in their possession. 
    As you may know, several bilateral agreements were signed yesterday in connection 
    with the issue of slave and forced labour. And we are also making efforts 
    to find a solution, acceptable to both sides, regarding &quot;aryanizations&quot;. 
    The negotiations relating to this issue began yesterday.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THIS GRADUAL COMING TO TERMS WITH 
    THE PAST&#150; also in a legal sense &#150; was neglected for a long time 
    &#150; for too long, in fact. As a result, there has been a strain on this 
    so very important relationship with our fellow Jewish citizens and their descendants. 
    It must therefore be in our all interest to make up for these omissions. We 
    also want the Jewish community in Austria to know that their contribution 
    to the cultural life of this country is a very valuable, even inalienable 
    component of how we see ourselves in this country. AUSTRIA AND, IN FACT, EUROPE, 
    OWES MANY DIFFERENT AND IMPRESSIVE ELEMENTS TO JUDAISM. We must therefore 
    continue to promote and protect Jewish life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ladies and Gentlemen, Perhaps you 
    may say: Haven't we known that all for a long time? Aren't these matters obvious? 
    &#150; Let me reply by also asking a question: Doesn't it also happen in Europe 
    today that fire bombs are thrown at synagogues? Doesn't it happen time and 
    again that Jewish cemeteries are desecrated? To be on the alert and to show 
    personal courage are therefore the dictates of the hour. Together, let us 
    be vigilant guardians of these virtues!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, we can hear time and 
    again questions like &quot;Shouldn't we make a clean break with the events 
    of the past? Shouldn't we stop looking back on the past all the time? Let 
    me react by saying very clearly: It is only by remembering the victims that 
    we are able to mould our future. That is the lesson that Simon Wiesenthal, 
    the initiator of this Memorial, has taught us and followed as a model throughout 
    his life. I would therefore like to thank Simon Wiesenthal most cordially 
    - he who has been a great teacher for Austria when the issue at stake was 
    to let the truth prevail. He has always regarded himself as a self-sacrificing 
    admonisher. He has often been misunderstood; YET, HE NEVER GAVE UP FEELING 
    COMMITTED SOLELY TO THE HISTORIC TRUTH. HARDLY ANY OTHER PERSON BUT HIM KNOWS 
    so well how difficult it is to make it possible for others to experience our 
    memories AND TO MEASURE, IN ALL THEIR DIMENSIONS AND COMPLEXITY, THE QUESTION 
    I ASKED AT THE BEGINNING: WHAT IS THE TIME SPAN FOR OUR RECOLLECTIONS? How 
    long do times past last? Richard Beer-Hoffmann, the Jewish poet, gave his 
    answer to the questions in his very forceful verses when he wrote:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;All are within us. Who feels 
    alone? You are their life &#150; their life is yours.&quot;</font></p>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)</font>...American support 
  for Israel was a popular move among Jews. And besides that, Israel was not only 
  more democratic than America's client states in Southeast Asia but a much brighter 
  military success to boot. </P>
<P>The steady alignment of American interests with Israel made it possible for 
  American Jews to be good Jews, good Democrats AND GOOD AMERCAN PATRIOTS TOO. 
  THIS SAME PERIOD GAVE BIRTH TO NEOCONSERVATISM, IN WHICH ISRAEL PLAYED A MAJOR 
  ROLE. The career of Norman Podhoretz might serve as an illustration. He was 
  once a man of the left who wondered, when ''thinking about the Jews,'' whether 
  ''their survival as a distinct group was worth one hair on the head of a single 
  infant.'' But, as he explained in a speech on the occasion of his retirement 
  as editor of Commentary in 1995, HE BEGAN TO CHANGE HIS MIND in the 60's, when 
  he became ''much more aggressive in defense of Jewish interests in general and 
  of Israel in particular.'' One reason was a sense of shock when defeat in Vietnam 
  threatened to turn THE UNITED STATES into a demoralized, enervated, even isolationist 
  power, WHICH WOULD NO LONGER STAND UP FOR GOOD AGAINST EVIL IN THE WORLD...</P>

</blockquote>
<P>...The other came roughly at the same time. Israel's occupation of Palestinian 
  territories made radical leftists in the United States as receptive as Europeans 
  to Arab and Soviet depictions of the Zionists as neo-Nazis. Disgust with this 
  kind of ''liberalism,'' as well as with A PERCEPTION OF AMERICAN WEAKNESS, PUSHED 
  FORMER LEFTISTS, like Podhoretz and Irving Kristol, managing editor of Commentary, 
  TO THE RIGHT. Convinced of ''THE INEXTRICABLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SURVIVAL 
  OF ISRAEL AND AMERICAN MILITARY STRENGTH,'' Podhoretz began to see American 
  dovishness in foreign affairs as a direct threat to Israeli survival. This feeling 
  may be shared by some European Jews too, but without the swagger that goes with 
  being a superpower citizen. Ruth Wisse, a professor of Yiddish literature at 
  Harvard, remarked about Podhoretz that ''because of the national confidence 
  that America nurtured in him, HE IS IMMUNE TO SELF-DOUBT and apologetics THAT 
  EAT UP SO MANY OF HIS CO-RELIGIONISTS FROM INSIDE.'' </P>
<P>This confidence is what Podhoretz and other neoconservatives sought to save 
  from the wreckage of Vietnam. One of their most powerful political allies in 
  this enterprise was Senator Henry (Scoop) Jackson, mentor of Richard Perle, 
  among others. Jackson, a gentile, a Democrat AND A STAUNCH COLD WARRIOR, was 
  the perfect bridge ON WHICH FORMER LEFTISTS COULD CROSS OVER TO THE RIGHT, without 
  actually joining the Republican Party. Henry Jackson was a founder of the America-Israel 
  Friendship League. Israel, to him, was not a sentimental issue but an essential 
  part OF HIS VISION OF THE UNITED STATES AS A NATION DESTINED TO FREE THE WORLD 
  FROM TYRANNY. ARAB NATIONALISM AND SOVIET COMMUNISM WERE SEEN AS EQUALLY DANGEROUS 
  in this rather Manichaean view of A WORLDWIDE BATTLE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL...</P>

    51:4,5). </font><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. </FONT></p>
</blockquote>
<P>...IT GOES WITH MANICHAEISM (WHICH IS, OF COURSE, WHAT APPEALS TO CHRISTIAN 
  FUNDAMENTALISTS TOO) THAT BATTLES ARE NOT ONLY STRATEGIC BUT ALSO EXISTENTIAL. 
  AND IN THE EYES OF MANY NEOCONS, IS WHAT PUTS ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES IN 
  THE SAME BOAT...</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The great difference that exists 
    between those on the political and religious Right, and those on the liberal, 
    intellectual Left--which essentially makes them the same--is that those on 
    the Right imagine that God is on their side, while those on the Left are not 
    much concerned about the idea of God at all, and believe that they themselves 
    and their generally-humanistic agenda are all-sufficient).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<P>...Podhoretz again: ''Just as the fervent wish of the Arab world to wipe the 
  Jewish state off the map derives not from anything Israel has done or failed 
  to do, BUT RATHER FROM ITS EXISTENCE ALONE, so we'' -- the United States -- 
  ''are hated not because of our policies but because of who and what we are.'' 
</P>
<P>The roots of neoconservative disillusion with liberalism and the almost OBSESSIVE 
  PROMOTION OF AMERICAN POWER go deeper than Vietnam, however. In Podhoretz's 
  case it goes back TO HIS CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ON A SCHOOL PLAYGROUND IN BROOKLYN, 
  where he was bullied by his black schoolmates. Blacks, he had always been told, 
  in good liberal fashion, were poor and persecuted, while Jews were rich and 
  powerful. Neither rich, nor powerful, young Norman grew to hate the boys that 
  beat him up with such ease. As he explained in a famous essay, ''My Negro Problem 
  -- and Ours,'' he hated them, but also admired them, for ''they were tough; 
  beautifully, enviably tough, not giving a damn for anyone or anything. To hell 
  with the teacher, the truant officer, the cop; to hell with the whole of the 
  adult world that held us in its grip and that we never had the courage to rebel 
  against.'' </P>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your pruninghooks 
    into spears: LET THE WEAK SAY I AM STRONG...</font></i><font size="+1">(Joel 
    3:9-14). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<P>...This is highly revealing. What Henry Jackson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, 
  Ariel Sharon, Benjamin Netanyahu and George W. Bush have in common is that they 
  enabled bookish men TO FEEL TOUGH, beautifully, enviably tough. Too much can 
  be made of the connection between the Chicago philosopher Leo Strauss and officials 
  in the current Pentagon, but one aspect of Strauss appears to have rubbed off 
  on them. Born in Germany, Strauss was a liberal rationalist in his youth. He 
  had hoped, he said, that anti-Semitism would end WITH JEWISH ASSIMILATION IN 
  A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. The Nazis taught him otherwise. By the 1920's he began 
  to regard liberals as weaklings, powerless to stop the violent mob. If one thing 
  ties neoconservatives, Likudniks, and post-cold-war hawks together, it is the 
  conviction that liberalism is strictly for sissies. </P>
<P>By the time Israel was attacked by Egypt and Syria in October 1973, it could 
  no longer be doubted which side the United States stood on, but the size of 
  American largess increased enormously. Before the Yom Kippur War, Congress agreed 
  to an annual loan to Israel of more than $500 million. After the war, this was 
  increased to $2.1 billion in loans and grants, much of which went into purchasing 
  American military hardware. Again, the influence of Jewish lobbies can be easily 
  exaggerated. President Nixon was not known for his warm feelings toward Jews, 
  and most Jews did not vote for him, but he saw Israel as a vital pawn in the 
  great game with the Soviets, especially when they were supplying Egypt with 
  arms. </P>
<P>Once Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979, and switched patrons from Moscow 
  to Washington, challenging the Soviets was no longer a major American concern. 
  But the revolution in Iran, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, produced another enemy 
  to confront. AND THIS NEW CONFRONTATION OUTLASTED THE COLD WAR. For Khomeini's 
  brand of revolutionary Islam inspired others. Among the Palestinians, who had 
  always been relatively secular, Islamist extremism gradually merged with Palestinian 
  nationalism. The intifadas began with throwing stones, but degenerated into 
  suicide attacks on Israeli citizens, organized by Palestinians with support 
  from parts of the Arab world. Seen from a particular perspective in America, 
  then, ESPECIALLY AFTER 9/11, Israel and the United States, bound together by 
  cold-war concerns in the 60's and 70's, were now thrown together in an existential 
  ''war against terrorism.'' This shaped a climate in which it is not just potentially 
  anti-Semitic to be critical of Israeli policies, but downright unpatriotic, 
  too... </P>

</blockquote>
<P>...If political perspectives have become muddled in the United States by an 
  identification with Israel that is too rarely critically examined, NON-AMERICANS 
  ARE MOSTLY INCAPABLE OF SEPARATING WHAT THEY THINK OF ISRAEL FROM WHAT THEY 
  THINK OF THE UNITED STATES. That is why the Japanese politician I interviewed 
  during the first gulf war automatically identified American policy with ''Jewish 
  interests.'' Japan, like much of the modern world, feels uncomfortably dependent 
  on American economic and military power. When people need to invent a malevolent 
  face for this overwhelming might, they often reach for the prejudices of a hateful 
  past. The Japanese politician may never have heard of the 19th-century Russian 
  forgery ''THE PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION,'' but it was widely read in prewar 
  Japan and is enjoying a popular revival in the Middle East today. </P>
<P>It is perfectly possible, of course, to take a critical view of Israeli policies, 
  and of their support in Washington, without being anti-Semitic. It is equally 
  possible to be critical of American policies without being irrationally and 
  emotionally anti-American. Just so, you can be opposed to CAPITALISM, or ''GLOBALIZATION,'' 
  without wishing to unleash or condone suicide attacks on Manhattan. What is 
  disturbing, however, is the way these views now increasingly come together in 
  a hostile cocktail. Most mass demonstrations in Europe, and elsewhere, against 
  the war in Iraq contained banners in support of the Palestinians, even the religious 
  extremists of Hamas, and against THE GLOBAL SYMBOLS OF CAPITALISM. For some 
  people on the left, being opposed to Israel, or Zionism, goes beyond specific 
  policies in Gaza or the West Bank; Israel is seen as the colonial Western presence 
  in an Arab world, AN AMERICAN CLIENT STATE LOCKED INTO GLOBAL CAPITALISM. Even 
  if the Israelis treated the Palestinians with the most scrupulous generosity 
  -- WHICH THEY DO NOT -- this impression would persist. </P>
<P>Not every demonstrator against Ariel Sharon's government or American imperialism 
  is an anti-Semite, to be sure, but the ready identification of Jewish interests 
  with the United States or, in the past, with Britain is old and loaded with 
  prejudice. Since the early 19th century, many Europeans associated the City 
  of London, as Wall Street is today, with financial power, materialist greed 
  and economic imperialism. To ethnic nationalists in Germany and elsewhere, Britain 
  and France, with their relative openness to immigrants, were seen as mongrel 
  nations, where citizenship could be bought for a crock of gold. </P>
<P>This is what Hitler meant WHEN HE CALLED FRANCE, BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES 
  &quot;JEWIFIED.'' He took the view, popularized by all manner of third-rate 
  scribblers, THAT A JEWISH CABAL WAS MANIPULATING WESTERN POWERS BEHIND THE SCENES. 
  French universalism and Anglo-Saxon capitalism, so it was believed, threatened 
  the unique values of culture and race. And behind all this were the Jews, pulling 
  strings in their cosmopolitan network of banks, newspapers and movie companies. 
</P>
<P>THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE BIGGEST CAPITALIST POWER IN THE WORLD...</P>

</blockquote>
<P>...To the extent that it is an empire, it is driven by economic interests, 
  but also, these days, by A MISSION TO SPREAD &quot;AMERICAN VALUES,'' as if 
  they were universal. Hollywood is seen in the outside world as part of this, 
  and so are Wall Street, the Pentagon and the International Monetary Fund. This, 
  alas, is precisely the kind of thing anti-Semites have always associated with 
  Jewish conspiracies. And since Israel is America's most favored ally in the 
  Middle East, and the Palestinian cause has become the universal litmus test 
  of liberal credentials, the idea that Jewish interests are driving American 
  foreign policy is even more widely believed, if not always openly stated. American 
  foreign policy and ancient prejudices ARE REINFORCING EACH OTHER IN A VICIOUS 
  CIRCLE. </P>
<P>For Israel, the American embrace is an ambiguous advantage. Although perhaps 
  vital for the nation's survival, it also makes Israel the hub of global hostility 
  toward the United States. It is, in any case, doubtful that the fate of Israel 
  is best served by its dependence on an alliance WITH CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALISTS 
  AND PEOPLE ON A MISSION TO LIBERATE THE WORLD WITH MILITARY FORCE. It may well 
  be that Israel's interests coincide with those of the United States for the 
  moment, but this should not be a given, never to be examined or reassessed...</P>

</blockquote>
<P>...The first condition for a reasoned examination would be to disentangle Israel's 
  politics from all the anti-Semitic myths and other leftovers of a murderous 
  past. This is not so easily done, since Israeli leaders have too often abused 
  history themselves. The Israeli bomb attack on an Iraqi nuclear installation 
  in 1981 might have been justified in many legitimate ways, but to say, as Prime 
  Minister Menachem Begin did, that it was to protect ''the children of Israel,'' 
  asking foreign reporters, ''Haven't you heard of one and a half million little 
  children who were thrown into gas chambers?'' is to dangerously confuse the 
  issue. The same was true when Prime Minister Sharon warned the United States 
  last year not to repeat the mistakes of 1938 and sell out Israel like Czechoslovakia. 
  Such false analogies serve only to invite equally odious comparisons from Israel's 
  critics. </P>
<P>Disentangling American and Israeli interests and government actions is, if 
  anything, even harder. To see Israel as nothing but a cat's paw of American 
  imperialism in the Middle East is a crude distortion. And to hold Washington 
  responsible for every Israeli action against the Palestinians is equally misguided. 
  But it is neither anti-Semitic nor blindly anti-American to point out that the 
  United States could have done much more to stop Israel from humiliating the 
  Palestinians BY TURNING THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES INTO A KIND OF WILD EAST OF 
  GUNSLINGING SETTLERS AND HOUNDED NATIVES</P>
<P>Finally, the politics of the Middle East may be murderous, but it is not helpful 
  to see them as an existential battle between good and evil. As long as such 
  a view persists, among zealots in Washington, Jerusalem and Nablus, the struggle 
  between Jews and Arabs will be forever obscured by a fog of noxious myths and 
  fantasies. RELIGIOUS FANATICISM IS CONFONDING THE POLITICS OF ISRAEL, AS WELL 
  AS THAT OF ITS ENEMIES. And its influence is felt in the United States as well. 
  Americans are right to support Israel's right to exist in peace, but criticism 
  of Israeli policies should not be stifled by Christian VISIONS OF ARMAGEDDON, 
  right-wing zealotry or memories of the culture wars in Brooklyn. This would 
  not be good for America, and it is certainly not good for the Jews. </P>

    is drawing the American pieces out across the Great Chessboard, extending 
    them, entangling them, and will move before the game is over to check and

</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Since the end of the cold war and the collapse of Communism, the United 
  States has accepted the &quot;victory&quot; and, for better or worse, has had 
  collective amnesia about global issues. After some 50 years during which foreign 
  affairs commanded the highest priority in Washington and on television and the 
  front page, the subject has virtually disappeared for most Americans. (And this 
  was true in a sense, until September 11th, 2001. Nevertheless the neo-cons of 
  the Reagan-Bush administrations were not asleep at their posts during the Clinton 
  years, and were cleverly devising and inciting the very global strategy that 
  is unfolding before our eyes at this present time).</p>
<p>This is true from top to bottom. President Clinton clearly pays as little attention 
  to foreign affairs as he can get away with...For many in the foreign policy 
  establishment, this means the public cares less and less about what they have 
  to say. But they keep saying it anyway. And some are saying with increasing 
  alarm: Wake up, America, before its too late.</p>
<p>One of those most troubled by the sudden turn in American attitudes is Zbigniew 
  Brzezinski, who from 1977 to 1981 was President Jimmy Carter's national security 
  advisor, and who has for years been one of the more provocative thinkers about 
  foreign affairs, particularly those dealing with the former Soviet bloc. What 
  has bothered Brzezinski is that as a result of the Soviet collapse, the United 
  States is the unquestionable world leader, unchallenged for the moment by any 
  other power. But American democracy does not lend itself well to the running 
  of empires. This has frustrated Brzezinski, who has now provided another scholarly 
  blueprint for what he believes the United States should do in the coming years 
  to further American interests, maintain the hegemony it commands and prevent 
  global anarchy. For Brzezinski this is a strategic game, not unlike chess, TO 
  OUTWIT POTENTIAL RIVALS, and hence the title of the book: &quot;The Grand Chessboard.&quot;...</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall 
    have them in derision.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath, and vex them 
    in His sore displeasure</font></i> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Recall 
    that Brzezinski's grand strategy was laid down well before September 11th...Deuteronomy 
    32:16-22; Isaiah 30:25. KJV)</font><font size="+1">...(Psalm 2:4,5)</font>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...This is not the first time Brzezinski has touched on this theme. Eleven 
  years ago he published &quot;THE GAME PLAN: A GEOSTRATIGIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE 
  CONDUCT OF THE U.S.-SOVIET CONTEST.&quot; And just four years ago, in the aftermath 
  of the Soviet disintegration, he wrote: &quot;Out of Control: Global Turmoil 
  on the Eve of the Twenty-first Century,&quot; which many saw as a counter to 
  the optimistic view of the future in &quot;The End of History and the Last Man,&quot; 
  by Francis Fukuyama...</p>
<p>Brzezinski, who writes convincingly if a bit inelegantly, describes a very 
  forbidding situation in the years ahead if the United States does not make more 
  permanent the dominance it now has over a vast area of the world. &quot;This 
  huge oddly-shaped Eurasian chessboard--extending from Lisbon to Vladivostok--provides 
  the setting for the game,&quot; Brzezinski says. &quot;IF THE MIDDLE SPACE CAN 
  BE DRAWN INCREASINGLY INTO THE EXPANDING ORBIT OF THE WEST (where America preponderates), 
  if the southern region is not subjected to domination by a single player, and 
  if the East is not unified in a manner that leads to the expulsion of America 
  from its offshore bases, AMERICA CAN THEN BE SAID TO PREVAIL...</p>
<p>He concludes bluntly that &quot;the time has come for the United States to 
  formulate and prosecute an integrated, comprehensive and long-term geostrategy 
  FOR ALL OF EURASIA...</p>
<p>How the United States manages this chessboard , he says, &quot;will be critical 
  to the longevity and stability of America's global primacy.&quot;...&quot;In 
  brief,&quot; he writes, &quot;the U.S. policy goal must be unapologetically 
  twofold: to perpetuate America's own dominant position...and to create a geopolitical 
  framework that can absorb the inevitable shocks and strains of social-political 
  change while evolving into the geopolitical core of shared responsibility for 
  peaceful global management.&quot;<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New

<P>I have to confess. The outrageous in-your-face behavior of the neocons finally 
  got to me - AS ARMAGEDDON APPROACHES, after seeing more and more references 
  to it (albeit usually wacky), I recently downloaded the Protocols of the Elders 
  of Zion. Guiltily, mind you, as if it were Mein Kampf or porno. I bet you haven't 
  dared (or bothered) to read it.</P>
<P>So, what is this best-selling political tract of the 20th century, the reading 
  of which carried the death penalty in Stalinist Russia, lauded by the likes 
  of Henry Ford and Winston Churchill, and then loudly condemned for the past 
  60 years since it was briefly declared an anti-Semitic forgery (in a Swiss court 
  in 1935 overturned by the Appeals Court in 1937)?</P>
<P>The bile aside, it is in fact an series of 24 mostly articulate, well-argued 
  lectures outlining a plan for world capitalist domination, with sharp political 
  and social analysis, lots of Machiavelli and a Marxian sophistication in ITS 
  UNDERSTANDING OF CAPITALISM AND HISTORICAL PROCESSES. Briefly, it outlines a 
  plan of world conquest by first establishing world government by consent. As 
  with any brilliant political analysis, it has been denounced, dismissed, misinterpreted 
  and banned. And made very good use of by those lusting for world power.</P>
<P>WHAT IMMEDIATELY STRUCK ME WAS THAT WITH A LITTLE DUSTING OFF, ABRIDGING AND 
  UPDATING, IT COULD EASILY BE THE HANDBOOK OF THE NEOCONS. With the wonders of 
  modern computers, you can download a free copy from the Internet, CLEANSE IT 
  OF ANTI-SEMITISM BY REPLACING &quot;FELLOW JEWS&quot; WITH &quot;NEOCONS" and 
  make sense of what's happening in the world today.</P>
<P>Mysterious origins? Not really</P>
<P>Though its origins are still unknown, it was clearly inspired by the French 
  revolution and its aftermath, the then-popular Masonic order, and most of all 
  the nascent 19th century Zionist movement. All that we know is that it was written 
  in France and brought to Russia, supposedly in 1884. It first appeared in print 
  in St Petersburg in 1903, but reached the West only after the Russian revolution. 
  It caused an immediate sensation, originally crudely interpreted as foretelling 
  the Bolshevik revolution as the crucial link in a Jewish conspiracy to rule 
  the world. As such, it was admired by the likes of Churchill and Ford, both 
  confirmed anti-communists and anti-Semites.</P>
<P>True, it has the prescience to allow for an anti-capitalist revolution on the 
  way to its final goal, but there's nothing even vaguely socialist in it. IT 
  IS FIRMLY FOUNDED ON A PLAN FOR CAPITALIST DOMINATION THROUGH JEWISH CONTROL 
  OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE and just happened to appear at the very moment of the 
  founding of the Zionist movement, with its goal of establishing as soon as possible 
  a Jewish state in Palestine, backed by powerful worldwide Ashkenazy Jewish economic 
  interests.</P>
<P>It's as if an especially ruthless and well-read 19th c Zionist, inspired by 
  the Rothschilds and other great Jewish financiers of the time, wrote it or most 
  of it, as I am sure is the case. Really, it reads as if it were written by the 
  Jungian shadow of the likes of Zionism's founder, Theodore Herzl, or any of 
  Israel's notables from Ben Gurion to Ariel Sharon. Its anti-goyim callousness 
  certainly indicate it was not written for public consumption, and after Hitler, 
  it was relegated to the Forbidden Shelf in ALL libraries along with Mein Kampf 
  and naked bottoms. But it is very hard to believe that it is a spoof or a mere 
  provocation, as it is just too impressive in detail and understanding of the 
  logic of late 19th c capitalism.</P>
<P>Did Hitler read it? I bet the Nazis read it carefully. They certainly followed 
  much of its advice, FROM HOW TO USE THE PRESS, TO HOW TO MANIPULATE BOTH POLITICIANS 
  AND THE MASSES consolidating their political hold. It's also clear why destruction 
  of the Jews became Hitler's tragic obsession. His New World Order (NWO) would 
  have to exclude a group even remotely connected with such a scheme for world 
  domination. As the neocons warn today: "You are either with us or against us."</P>
<P>Many paths - but they all lead to Rome <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(eh, 
  that would be America)</font>.</P>
<P>The trouble with the Protocols is that it has been interpreted since it was 
  published to suit the prejudices of the moment. In pre-revolutionary Russia, 
  it provided fuel for the already widespread Russian anti-Semitism. In post-WWI 
  Europe and America, it provided fuel against the Russian revolution. In the 
  post-WWII world, it became the Bible of American isolationists and racists who 
  see the poor UN as the dreaded "World Government," backed by the Soviet Union 
  and 3rd world revolutions. Now it is read by Muslims as proof of the conspiracy 
  by US imperialism to destroy them.</P>
<P>Another problem is that there have been many variations on the theme of the 
  NWO ever since the collapse of the Roman Empire. The French revolution and Napoleonic 
  conquests, the Masonic lodges, imperial Germany and England all have had their 
  own NWO fantasy. The Russian revolution was the most radical attempt at a NWO, 
  and even can be distinguished for the large number of Jews who took part, but 
  despite the fact that the Protocols was first published in Russia and strictly 
  banned during the Soviet period, the Soviet experiment was not even remotely 
  the final World Government of the Protocols, as it was anti-capitalist in its 
  essence.</P>
<P>The red herring in it is of course 'Jewish', which is supposed to refer to 
  a race. The Jews referred to in the Protocols are the European Ashkenazy Jews, 
  who had been traditionally usurers and who were in the 19th century becoming 
  increasing wealthy and part of the mainstream European culture. From them sprang 
  THE ZIONISTS, WHO TRANSFORMED A RELIGION WHERE GOD IS TO BRING THEM TO THE &quot;PROMISED 
  LAND&quot; SOMEDAY INTO AN ACTIVE PLAN TO SEIZE PALESTINE based on their growing 
  international economic and financial might...</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b><font size="+1"><i></i></font></b><font size="+1"><i>Therefore thus saith 
    the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a precious 
    corner stone, a sure foundation, HE THAT BELIEVETH SHALL NOT MAKE HASTE...</i>(Isaiah 
    28:16,17).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<P>...So it is this group that is the real inspiration behind the Protocols and 
  not some amorphous Jewish RACE. Think of the authors as the neocons of the day. 
  For by the 19th century, usury was the norm, AAND THE RAPID SPREAD OF CAPITALISM 
  MEANT THAT THE WESTERN WORLD EFFECTIVELY BECAME JEWISH, as Marx put it, and 
  adopted the Jewish idea of success.</P>
<P>Yet another problem. It is loudly dismissed as a forgery. Hello? It was anonymous, 
  so how can it be a forgery. Who forged what? No wonder the Swiss Appeals Court 
  threw the case out. In that case we can dismiss the Bible as a forgery. And 
  who cares who wrote the Psalms anyway? They stand on their own merits, as does 
  the Protocols stripped of a few provocative phrases here and there, which could 
  have been slipped in by anyone.</P>
<P>You may well protest: "The Protocols attributes the conscious machinations 
  of Jews to be behind all historical developments. I don't believe the Zionists 
  are either so powerful, or so far-sighted." In answer: It's not necessary for 
  our actions to be premeditated. THE LOGIC OF WORLD CAPITALISM SWEEPS US ALONG, 
  WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. SOME PLAYERS ARE MORE CONSCIOUS (AND RUTHLESS) THAN 
  OTHERS. They become the Herzls, the Wolfowitzes, the Sharons. The rest of us 
  get swept along, either yielding to, or fighting the current: the Bushes and 
  the Schwartzeneggers or the goyim. THE PROTOCOLS (or its original, if it is 
  indeed a forgery) WAS INSPIRED BY THE NEW ECONOMIC SYSTEM SWEEPING THE WORLD, 
  and composed by the 19th century equivalent of the neocons. It hasn't played 
  itself out yet, just as capitalism hasn't played itself out. WE IGNORE IT AT 
  OUR PERIL.</P>
<P>Arise, ye prisoners of starvation?</P>
<P>Contrast the Zionist movement with the other great attempt at a NWO from the 
  19th century on -- the world socialist movement. It is far weaker, split by 
  nationalism and hundreds of ideological splinters, and motivated by social justice, 
  a far less competitive motivation that money, wealth and power-for-its-own-sake. 
  The Protocols is quite clear about this: "OUR TRIUMPH HAS BEEN RENDERED EASIER 
  BY THE FACT THAT IN OUR RELATIONS WITH THE MEN WHOM WE WANTED WE HAVE ALWAYS 
  WORKED UPON THE MOST SENSITIVE CHORDS OF THE HUMAN MIND, UPON THE CASH ACCOUNT, 
  UPON THE CUPIDITY, UPON THE INSATIABILITY FOR MATERIAL NEEDS OF MAN: AND EACH 
  ONE OF THESE WEAKNESSES, TAKEN ALONE, IS SUFFICIENT TO PARALYZE INITIATIVE, 
  FOR IT HANDS OVER THE WILL OF MEN TO THE DISPOSITION OF HIM WHO HAS BOUGHT THEIR 
  ACTIVITIES.&quot;</P>
<P>There is no fear of the dangerous effective of democracy: "THE ABSTRACTION 
  OF FREEDOM has enabled us to persuade the mob in all countries that their government 
  is nothing but the steward of the people who are the owners of the country, 
  and that the steward may be replaced like a worn-out glove. It is this possibility 
  of replacing the representatives of the people which has placed them at our 
  disposal, and, as it were, given us the power of appointment." (I)</P>
<P>Socialism never had a chance against this corrosive Machiavellianism, though, 
  just in case, the Protocols had a plan: "The hour strikes when, not for the 
  sake of attaining the good, not even to win wealth, but solely out of hatred 
  towards the privileged, the lower classes of the goyim will follow our lead 
  against our rivals for power, the intellectuals of the goyim." (IV) This is 
  the only reference to the use of a revolt of the masses, which was seized upon 
  to associate the Protocols with the Russian revolution. Rather slim pickings, 
  and it reveals the strategy is to undermine the "intellectuals of the goyim", 
  i.e., the socialist opposition to world capitalism.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Russian revolution seemed to really shake the very foundations 
  of the plan for world capitalist domination. Curiously in its first 30 years 
  the SU had the Zionists split. Why? Well, no doubt partly because many rank-and-file 
  Zionists were socialist by persuasion, truly wanted the SU to succeed and hoped 
  for a socialist Israel as a bonus (Herzl's utopian novel depicts a socialist 
  Israel). But for the Zionist fanatics of the Protocols, their fence-sitting 
  was because achieving their own state was the main priority, and required the 
  support of both the communist and capitalist camps.</P>
<P>And as for the softer versions of socialism which have surfaced occasionally 
  in the West, their headway has always been kept well in check, and social democratic 
  reforms were rolled back very easily after the collapse of the SU, via the tactics 
  envisaged in the Protocols. So the plan of the Protocols should not be confused 
  with the many variations on a socialist/ communist NWO.</P>
<P>If you can't beat 'em, join 'em</P>
<P>The Protocols also lauds "the successes we arranged for Darwinism, Marxism, 
  Nietzscheism." Why promote such radicals? Because of the "disintegrating importance 
  these directives have had upon the minds of the goyim." Just how central to 
  Marx's success these Zionists were is debatable.</P>
<P>But it's become clear to me that Zionists have penetrated and tried to control 
  all the NWO fantasies, from left to right, to further their own cause. It is 
  not surprise then that they have been at the center of the present neocon insurgency 
  from the start. And as for the EU-as-NWO, Sharon even suggested Israel should 
  join the EU since 'we share common ideals'. In spite of Israel's loathing for 
  the UN, it is at the very heart of THAT beleaguered, clumsy organization too 
  (with a stake in hand just in case, it can be argued). It has recently been 
  revealed that Zionists are even involved with extreme right anti-Semitic movements 
  in Europe and with the creation of Hamas. After all, anti-Semitism is the Zionist's 
  best defense. "The Jewish group has thrived on oppression and on the antagonism 
  it has forever met in the world." (Albert Einstein, Collier's Magazine, November 
  26, 1938)</P>
<P>True, anti-Semitism got out of control under Hitler and it even looked like 
  it was touch-and-go for a while for the Ashkenazy Jews of Europe, but fascism 
  was in turn destroyed by a capitalist-communist alliance, with Zionists at its 
  heart, as the Protocols so brilliantly foretold: "For a time perhaps we might 
  be successfully dealt with by a coalition of the goyim of all the world: but 
  from this danger we are secured by the discord existing among them whose roots 
  are so deeply seated that they can never now be plucked up." Divide and rule!</P>
<P>The Holocaust gave the fanatical Zionists their long-sought state, which allowed 
  them to discard any socialist pretensions and nurture the capitalist-Zionist 
  alliance essential to the goal of world domination. THE DEFINING MOMENT IS PERHAPS 
  THE TRIUMPH OF THE NEOCONS UNDER REAGAN IN THE 1980s. The Zionists had consolidated 
  their hold on American foreign policy under Democrat Carter, and were ready 
  to make the alliance official under Republican Reagan. It is at this point that 
  the very term Zionist and even Jew can be discarded. As I have argued elsewhere, 
  'We are all Jews now.' (http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Articles4/Jones_Palestine.htm) 
  And with the Bush coup in 2000, we all (for the present at least) have become 
  neocons (or goyim). As the opposition grows weaker, with the shield of the Holocaust 
  at the ready, the neocon-Zionist alliance has begun to act more and more brazenly 
  to consolidate its hold on the world and destroy the last meaningful resistance 
  - the Islamic world.</P>
<P>The ultimate trump card</P>
<P>Not only was the Holocaust and the way to defeat it foreseen in the Protocols, 
  but, like the anti-Semitism that gave rise to it, it has been turned into the 
  ultimate defense of the Zionist cause. A kind of perverse win-win situation 
  for the Zionists. It transformed important anti-Semites into Judeophiles overnight. 
  While Churchill was an enthusiastic reader of the Protocols before WWII, he 
  became an enthusiastic supporter of the foundation of Israel after, and shifted 
  his anti-Semitism onto the Arabs. Stalin, also a confirmed anti-Semite, provided 
  the key vote at the UN to approve the foundation of Israel and supplied crucial 
  arms via Czechoslovakia to the beleaguered state, foolishly thinking he could 
  ultimately manipulate. Ha, ha! Finally it became the linchpin in consolidating 
  today's neocon-Zionist alliance, and a brilliant defense for all manner of Zionist 
  crimes: "We can do anything to defend ourselves after the Holocaust!" </P>
<P>The icing on the cake is the impressive Holocaust museum which blends in tastefully 
  with the Lincoln and Washington memorials in the heart of Washington, D.C. (Note: 
  There is no museum to the Holocaust against the native peoples or the blacks.)</P>
<P>A crack in the wall?</P>
<P>While 'Old Europe' has made some noises about this lethal NWO, the governments 
  are nonetheless beholden to it, and can do little but try to carve a slightly 
  bigger piece of the pie. No, the only meaningful remaining resistance to the 
  neocon-Zionist NWO is the as yet unbrainwashed goyim of the world - the peace 
  movement and the Islamic world, strange bedfellows at best. However, there are 
  some disturbing ripples in the NWO waters. Bush/ Sharon have chosen the warpath, 
  while the Soros branch, which includes Europe, wants a more peaceful transition. 
  The reckless policies of the erstwhile "servile administrator" in Washington 
  are quite possibly endangering the very economic foundation of the NWO. The 
  Protocols foresees such chaos, THOUGH IT PRESUMES TO BE IN CONTROL OF IT: "We 
  shall soon begin to establish huge monopolies, reservoirs of colossal riches, 
  upon which even large fortunes of the GOYIM will depend to such an extent that 
  they will go to the bottom together with the credit of the States on the day 
  after the political smash...."</P>
<P>SUCH A COLLAPSE OF THE PRESENT WORLD FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS NOT AT ALL BEYOND 
  THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY. AND IF IT COMES IT COULD TAKE DOWN THE US GOVERNEMENT 
  AND THE NEOCONS WITH IT. It is here that the PROTOCOLS begins to unravel. The 
  Protocols assumes the corporate financial cabal controlling the world economy 
  will be invited to take over bankrupt governments with their World Government, 
  as indeed has been happening under the guise of IMF restructuring programs and 
  more recently by direct invasion. But the bankrupt and invaded countries, such 
  as Argentina, most of Africa, Afghanistan, Iraq for starters are proving to 
  be problematic, more than the cabal can digest.</P>
<P>MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, THE NEOCONS' GAMBLE WILL TRIP THEM UP before they reach 
  the finish line and they will end up along side the despised GOYIM at the bottom. 
  A switch to a gold dinar in the Muslim world and oil-euros for the rest would 
  seriously endanger the NWO, as would a massive ecological disaster, natural 
  or man-made.</P>
<P>The mild neocons (Soros etal) see this clearly and are scurrying to minimize 
  collateral damage. Theirs is a strategy closer to the spirit of the Protocols 
  - no overt wars, a careful amassing of power through education and the control 
  of the press, no dangerous splits in the capitalist-Zionist alliance, achieving 
  victory through financial and trade blackmail. Have a look at the Protocols 
  yourself. It's all there.</P>
<P>So, are these cowboy jackboot high jinks a momentary glitch in the triumphal 
  march to the neocon-Zionist paradise? Will a Howard Dean, urged on by Soros, 
  put the out-of-control steamroller back on its proper path? Or has the Protocols 
  played itself out? IS OUR PRESENT APOCALYPTIC SCENARIO INSTEAD A CRACK THAT 
  GIVES US HOPE OF EMERGING FROM THIS NIGHTMARISH PLOT?</P>

<P>Rational racism?</P>
<P>I don't know about the Elders, the Symbolic Snake, the actual killing off of 
  the goyim, WHETHER THE LINE OF KING DAVID WILL BE RE-ESTABLISHED TO RULE THE 
  WORLD, the importance of the Masons, or whether the French Revolution "was wholly 
  the work of our hands". There's surprisingly little of such bile for a work 
  of such notoriety, and it can be easily edited out so as not to distract from 
  the sharp analysis. Perhaps it was added by an anti-Semite as a provocation. 
  Who knows? As for the Masons, come to think of it, the popularity of them, the 
  Yale Skull and Bones, and other such Monty-Pythonesque groups shows a stubborn 
  inclination by would-be GOYIM leaders to voluntarily (i.e., consciously or unconsciously) 
  make themselves part of a world conspiracy, however idiotic.</P>
<P>That's not so much the problem. The major flaw behind the logic of the Protocols 
  is its basic premise - that there is a Jewish race. There is only one race - 
  the human race. Just have a look at Israeli society if you think there is a 
  racial basis to Judaism. But hey! Scientists are discovering that there are 
  genes which are responsible for skin color, that define risk-takers or those 
  susceptible to various diseases. MAYBE THERE'S A GENE FOR THESE WOULD-BE ELDERS

  now welcome to their fold those who share their lust for capitalist world domination. 
  All those with gene DN145, please sign up here. We are all equal before Mammon. 
  MBA schools will go crazy.</P>
<P>The Masonic lodges, Skull and Bones fraternities, the Jewish 'race' itself 
  are just foils in this march of world capitalism, gathering in like-minded wanabes 
  as it makes its final push for total control. It is somehow fitting that the 
  once reviled Jew should sit one day on the world's golden throne surrounded 
  by his neocon minions. That is the Protocols' vision of the end of history.

<P align="center"><b>THE NEOCONS AND WOODROW WILSON</b></P>
<p align="center"><b>By PHILIP GOLD</b></p>
<p>Sunday, May 11, 2003. I know from neocons. Midge Decter, the movement's grande 
  dame, introduced me to journalism in 1981. She and neocon&quot;godfather&quot; 
  Irving Kristol helped get me the grant for my first book. Throughout the '80s 
  and much of the '90s, while living in Washington, D.C., I worked with neocons, 
  wrote for them, attended their conferences, appeared with them on panels and 
  occasionally drank their whiskey. I still read their stuff and, for the most 
  part, I like them as people. But I also know that, in three critical ways, Joshua 
  Muravchik's description elides some unflattering truths.</p>
<p>First, neoconservatism is a multigenerational movement that has never really 
  been conservative or fully accepted by the mainstream, let alone the fringes. 
  At its best, it was a valuable aberration. Today, it's maligned. Second, although 
  the younger neocons, the Boom X generation, are Republicans, THEY DRAW THEIR 
  DEEPEST SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION FROM WOODROW WILSON. That's a dangerous liaison. 
  And third, there's the matter of neocon &quot;influence&quot; -- an issue that, 
  sadly, cannot be divorced from the tawdry subject of anti-Semitism and its present 
  real and/or alleged reinvigoration. </p>
<p>NEOCONSERVATISM, as Muravchik notes, AROSE IN THE 70s AS A REACTION TO THE 
  60s. IT WAS AT FIRST A NEW YORK PHENOMENON AND MOSTLY, though far from entirely, 
  JEWISH. It reflected the sensibilities of a unique generation of intellectuals, 
  often starting out as the poor children of immigrants, who made the long march 
  from Brooklyn and City College of New York and FDR for some and Trotsky for 
  others, to that literary section of Manhattan where they take their politics 
  and their cocktail parties -- and their book reviews -- very, very seriously. 
  These were people of ideas, always articulate and often brilliant, who'd also 
  known depression, war, discrimination and lives of unrelenting effort. They 
  had struggled and succeeded. They were, in short, full dues-paying members of 
  the Greatest Generation. </p>
<p>And neoconservatism was as much their personal journey, their midlife crisis, 
  as a political movement. Irving Kristol, a founder of &quot;The Public Interest,&quot; 
  and Norman Podhoretz, former editor of &quot;Commentary&quot; and author of 
  &quot;Making It,&quot; have written movingly of this. THEIR BREAK WITH THE LEFT 
  WAS PAINFUL AND COMPLEX, BOTH A FAREWELL TO THEIR OWN GENERATION AND A REPUDIATION 
  OF THE 1960s NEW LEFT EXCESSES that their former friends' children had wrought. 
  The children they chided for their tantrums and immaturity, the parents for 
  their excessive tolerance and flaccidity in the face of barbarisms both foreign 
  and domestic.</p>
<p>Midge Decter's &quot;Liberal Parents, Radical Children&quot; can still be read 
  with profit here. Indeed, many saw liberalism's greatest failure AS A MATTER 
  OF &quot;WILL&quot; AND &quot;NERVE,&quot; two favorite neocon value-words, 
  especially when dealing with communists and kids. AND WHEN THEY TOOK UP RONALD 
  (WILSON) REAGAN, it was his steady anti-communism that they found most attractive. 
  All in all, they were the right people at the right time. THEY HELPED FASHION 
  THE &quot;WILL&quot; AND THE &quot;NERVE&quot; THAT BROUGHT THE SOVIETS DOWN. 
</p>
<p>Nor are their children lacking in will, certainly not in the chicken hawk sense 
  -- an unfair epithet, but not entirely inapt, APPLIED TO THOSE WHO URGE WAR 
  and pander to bellicosity BUT NEVER SERVED, OR WILL SERVE, THEMSELVES. What 
  they are lacking is their parents' depth and life experiences. And perhaps it 
  is not too much to suggest that the current leadership of the movement shows 
  more than a trace of the arrogance imputed to Boomer and Generation X left radicals, 
  and of the infatuation with their own theories that only those who've never 
  been smacked upside the head by reality (poverty, unfriendly fire, hard bigotry) 
  can indulge. </p>
<p>What theories? Today, the Boomer/Generation X neocons invoke icons of steadfastness 
  such as Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan, even Winston Churchill. But neocon writer 
  and former Wall Street Journal editor Max Boot caught it best some months ago 
  WHEN HE DESCRIBED THEIR PREFERRED FOREIGN POLICY AS &quot;HARD WILSONIANISM&quot;-- 
  making the world safe for democracy, THIS TIME WITH THE WILL AND THE NERVE AND 
  THE POWER TO MAKE IT STICK. Whatever else this may be, it is not conservatism, 
  which holds these truths to be self-evident: </p>
<p>History does not begin anew with us. We cannot force people to be free. Evil 
  is real and, therefore, best we take a modest, exceedingly modest, view of our 
  ability to change human nature. And speaking of human nature, power corrupts. 
  It corrupts those who wield it. And it corrupts those who seek to influence 
  those who wield it. WHEN WOODROW WILSON SAILED FOR THE VERSAILLES PEACE CONFERENCE 
  IN 1919, HE TOOK WITH HIM A TRAVELIING THINK TANK KNOWN AS &quot;THE INQUIRY.&quot; 
  He exhorted these young intellectuals, some of whom wrote for and most of whom 
  read The New Republic: &quot;TELL ME WHAT'S RIGHT AND I WILL FIGHT FOR IT!&quot; 
</p>
<p>WE'RE STILL TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE MESS THOSE INTELLECTUALS MADE. And in some 
  ways, from &quot;The New Republic&quot; then to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; 
  now, not that much of a change. </p>
<p>Which brings us to the subject of influence. Muravchik is right. Some of President 
  Bush's policies &quot;resemble things advocated by neocons,&quot; but &quot;Who 
  knows how Bush decides?&quot; (Does Bush always know?) And anyway, as Midge 
  Decter wisely warned me, influence can never be claimed. It can only be bestowed 
  by those who are influenced. What is bestowed can be taken away. Even the appearance 
  of influence can lead to an unpleasant backlash. </p>
<p>And if you're Jewish, and high-visibility, and associated with controversial 
  policies and perilous actions, if your name is Kristol (Irving or son Bill) 
  or Podhoretz (Norman or son John) or Kagan or Perle or Wolfowitz or Frum, backlash 
  can get ugly. Is this happening? It's hard to say. It's expected that the Arab 
  press would run articles headlined, &quot;PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF NEOCON.&quot; 
  It's not surprising when neocons such as David Brooks complain in print about 
  anti-Semitic e-mails and phone messages. It's business-as-usual when segments 
  of the far right and the farther left find themselves accused of bigotry masquerading 
  as anti-Zionism, or anti-neoconism. But it's something else entirely to hear, 
  as I have, military officers speak openly and contemptuously of &quot;the Likudniks 
  in the E-Ring&quot; (Likud being Ariel Sharon's party, the E-Ring the Pentagon 
  corridor where the senior leadership hangs out). </p>
<p>And it's scary to realize that the United States has undertaken to remake the 
  Islamic world in our own image and to our own satisfaction, by military conquest 
  and occupation and the making of examples, in order to encourage the others. 
  And harder still to know that the most prominent advocates of THIS NEW WILSONIAN 
  IMPERIALISM are a small group of public intellectuals with no significant political 
  or cultural base and scant knowledge of the nation beyond the Beltway or the 
  world beyond their abstractions. And it would be tragic, were a movement that 
  did some good once, to be remembered -- mostly for its part in marching the 
  nation toward folly.</p>

  <b>Exclusive to American Free Press<br>
  By M. Raphael Johnson<br>
  11-8-03</b></p>
<p>&quot;According to a recent article by veteran British military analyst Joseph 
  Vialls, Russia has sent the most advanced and feared missile in the world, owned 
  only by Russia and China, the P270 Moskit, also known as the 'Sunburn,' to Damascus 
  and Tehran. This can only be understood as a counter to the Israeli threats 
  to use nuclear weapons against their enemies. The Sunburn flies at an altitude 
  of 60 feet and is nearly impossible to defend against. A few fired at Israel 
  could make that state 'history.'</p>
<p> Add to this a new Russian air force installation near the Kyrgystan/Russia 
  border, coupled with a Chinese base just over their western border with Kyrgystan, 
  and Armageddon may be on the horizon. All Russian jets at this new base just 
  outside of Bishkek are equipped with Sunburn missiles.</p>
<p>Vialls writes: The gloves are off, and with America and Israel still unable 
  to steal any oil from Iraq because someone keeps blowing the pipelines, Russian 
  and Chinese firepower buildup suddenly slammed the door firmly shut on Caspian 
  oil reserves in the old Soviet republics. For more than a decade American oil 
  multinationals have been conducting 'joint ventures' in the former Soviet republics 
  bordering the Caspian Sea, with the stated intent of pumping stolen crude oil 
  out through Turkey, then on to western markets. Now this route has been blocked 
  permanently, and America is in no position to do anything about it, because 
  a large part of the U.S. conventional army is currently bogged down in Iraq, 
  being shot at and killed on a daily basis. <br>
</p>
<p>For many who have been watching this region as a confrontation between the 
  United States and Israel versus Russia largely over the control of the biggest 
  gas and oil deposits in the world, a new front has been opened. As a response 
  to this checkmate, Sharon recently visited Putin on Nov. 3 to meet with him 
  concerning the nuclear issue in Iran. Quickly, Sharon permitted Palestinians 
  to return to their jobs and eased their travel restrictions. <br>
</p>
<p>Since the end of the Gorbachev era, the Russian oligarchs, nearly all Jewish 
  by ethnicity (with the noticeable exception of Vladimir Potanin), have controlled 
  nearly all key sectors of the Russian economy. This, of course, includes Russia's 
  major ace-in-the-hole, oil and gas. The giant YUKOS conglomerate is presently 
  one of the largest oil companies in the world, valued at about $40 billion. 
  YUKOS is the result of a 'loans for shares' deal brokered through the semi-coherent 
  Boris Yeltsin in 1995. Here, the liberal Russian government swapped loyalty 
  from the oligarchs in exchange for privatization at prices far below that of 
  the market. This $40 billion giant was bought for about $300 million, thus looting 
  the entire Russian economy for the benefit of a handful of Israeli citizens 
  living in Russia. <br>
</p>
<p>When YUKOS' chair, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at the end of last month, 
  the American capitalist establishment went orbital. Forgetting the 1999 New 
  York Times's expose on massive money laundering and fraud from YUKOS, the conservative 
  establishment began to lionize oligarchy and, specifically, Khodorkovsky. Recently, 
  The Financial Times weighed in with a giggly piece from Chrystia Freeland, which 
  referred to the oligarch as a 'democratic activist.' About a paragraph later, 
  the writer said - without irony - that the oligarch's model for economics is 
  the robber baron factories of the early American 20th century. Fox News, on 
  Nov. 3, referred to YUKOS as the most progressive corporation in Russia. <br>
</p>
<p>According to a Nov. 3 Agence France-Presse story, Khodorkovsky made a deal 
  with Jacob Rothschild this year that control of the YUKOS giant would pass to 
  Rothschild in the event of Khodorkovsky's arrest. However, the Russian government 
  has frozen all YUKOS assets for the time being. It is significant that YUKOS's 
  liberal pressure group, the Open Russia Foundation, is completely controlled 
  by Rothschild now that its founder is in jail. As their official mission statement 
  reads, &quot;The motivation for the establishment of the Open Russia Foundation 
  is the wish to foster enhanced openness, understanding and integration between 
  the people of Russia and the rest of the world.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>Their board of trustees includes Rothschild and Henry Kissinger. The Washington, 
  D.C. launch of the organization included Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Librarian 
  of Congress James Billington, one of the leading voices against Russian traditionalism 
  in the academic establishment. Significantly, the Open Russia Foundation recently 
  provided Yale University with substantial grants to study the Russian economy 
  as well as providing the Carnegie Foundation with 3 percent of its entire operating 
  budget. It seems that the drive to control the globe's energy is progressing. 
  The American empire's battles in Serbia, Central Asia, Iraq and Chechnya are 
  one and the same war. Other than fighting Israel's enemies, these adventures 
  are also wars to control Central Asian oil and natural gas (one of the main 
  pipelines from the Caspian Sea went straight through Serbia). The control of 
  this wealth by the United States and Israel necessitates bypassing Russian channels. 
  This means that the Jewish oligarchy in Russia would become the central actor 
  in world politics.</p>
<p> The Israeli/CIA complex was using Khodorkovsky to sell off the assets of YUKOS 
  to Exxon/Mobil (as well as a smaller piece to Texaco), hence bringing Russia's 
  pipelines into the hands of the western powers. The Nov. 5 New York Times also 
  indicated that the Bush family's Carlyle Group was involved. </p>
<p>It was not long after Putin began threatening the YUKOS conglomerate that neo-conservative 
  pundits such as William Kristol and Ariel Cohen began calling Putin a 'communist,' 
  'another Stalin' and 'tyrannical.' The basis of these wild accusations, of course, 
  is the fact that Putin stands in the way of Zionist domination. From this, the 
  roles of several other variables and players develop clearly. The State Department/Harvard 
  University alliance was meant to 'deregulate,' or 'privatize' much of the Russian 
  economy precisely to keep the Russian state out of the equation. Therefore, 
  pro-Israel oligarchs (that is, Israeli citizens living in Russia) then benefited, 
  placing most of the economy in their hands, and, by extension, Israel's. <br>
</p>
<p>Russia's response has been to clamp down on further foreign penetration into 
  defense and other sensitive industries, and specifically, to target those believed 
  to be working for both the CIA and Mossad and attempting to control Central 
  Asian oil. It needs to be reiterated that where the (CIA goes, Mossad goes as 
  well. Israeli and American interests have come together in the dominance of 
  the Central Asian region and therefore, so have liberal ideology, the Beltway 
  set, neo-conservatism, Ivy League eggheads, Christian Zionism, the Rothschilds 
  and the American media.) Afghanistan through the Caspian Sea through to Georgia, 
  Azerbaijan and into the Balkans (not to mention pipelines leading to oil-hungry 
  China), have become one single theater of war over trillions of dollars in oil 
  and gas wealth, incorporating every single power center in global politics. 
  The battle against the New World Order is being decided in Moscow. </p>
<p>Therefore, all anti-Russian alliances in the region, from Islamic fundamentalism 
  to Slavic separatism to the George Soros 'Open Society' Foundation, are in the 
  interests of the CIA/Exxon/Ivy League/NWO complex. In Azerbaijan, for example, 
  American elites have pushed for a 'democratic' state, that is, a state not under 
  the control of pro-Moscow Heydar Aliev, thus leaving the country open to U.S. 
  oil investment. Aliev, of course, is promoting Russian interests in the region, 
  and thus, has become a &atilde;tyrant&auml; in the Beltway mind. The American 
  response to this situation within this region is to create the GUAAM pact, including, 
  Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova. </p>
<p>Cohen gives us a clue as to why this entity was brokered under NATO auspices: 
  &quot;The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline will export up to 1 million barrels per 
  year of high quality Caspian crude oil by 2005.&quot; In other words, billions 
  of dollars of oil are slated to be pumped through this region very soon, and 
  the economic/military alliance of GUAAM is the means to ensure American control 
  over it. This connects the Serbian, Afghan and Iraqi wars. Russia's response 
  to Israel's terror threats against most of the Islamic world is fully understood 
  as both a political and economic question. Further, increasing cooperation between 
  Russia and India, as well as China, are clear markers that Putin, one of the 
  few actually competent leaders in world politics, is building an anti-imperialist 
  and anti-NATO alliance with the aim of countering American/Zionist moves for 
  the world's oil and gas wealth. </p>
<p>The interests, however, go even further than Zionist control over American 
  foreign policy decision-making. Vialls writes on another topic: that the existence 
  of the American/Zionist empire is based on the victory of American forces over 
  the Russian and Islamic. Of course, both in Bosnia and Chechnya, the Mossad/CIA 
  operatives have not hesitated to assist fundamentalists in fighting Slavic nationalism, 
  largely because Slavicism is a greater threat with Putin firmly in the saddle. 
  Islam, divided and leaderless, with a history of centuries of defeat and colonialism 
  behind it, is only a potential force in world politics. <br>

<p align="center">Is Bush Doomed?</p>
<p align="center">by Paul Craig Roberts<b> <br>
  <br>
  </b>January 17, 2004 <br>
</p>
<p align="left"><br>
  &quot;Fear must be coursing through President Bush's veins as he realizes the 
  Iraqi trap in which the neocons have placed him. Bush is caught between an Iraqi 
  civil war and a wider insurgency. Desperate to extricate himself from the weekly 
  carnage well before the November election, Bush can neither deliver on his promise 
  of democracy via direct elections nor impose his plan for an Iraqi assembly 
  elected indirectly by caucuses. </p>
<p>If Bush delivers on his democracy promise, the Shi'ites with 60% of the population 
  will be elected, and the country will break out in civil war. If he tries to 
  water down Shi'ite representation with his plan for an assembly elected indirectly 
  by caucuses, the so far peaceful Shi'ites are likely to join the violence. </p>
<p>If the Shi'ites become violent, the insurgency would be too large to be contained 
  by our present occupying force. Moreover, the outbreak of a general rebellion 
  in Iraq would spill over throughout the Middle East where unpopular secular 
  rulers are sitting on a smoldering Islam. Our puppet in Pakistan would likely 
  bite the dust. Israel would then face countervailing Muslim nukes. </p>
<p>If you think more US troops are needed now in Iraq, imagine how many more would 
  be required to deal with a wider conflagration. Where would they come from? 
  The US military is already so thinly stretched that soon 40% of the occupying 
  troops will be drawn from the National Guard and reservists, resulting in tremendous 
  disruption in the affairs of tens of thousands of families. Pilots and troops 
  are shunning the cash bonuses offered for reenlistments. The troops recognize 
  a quagmire even if their neocon overlords cannot. The only source of troops 
  is the draft. </p>
<p>A Shi'ite insurgency that brought back the draft would deprive Bush of reelection. 
  A civil war with the prospect of a Kurdish state would bring in the Turks. On 
  January 14 Turkish prime minister Erdogan said that Turkey will intervene in 
  the event of Iraq's disintegration. The Shi'ites and the Turks are forming an 
  alliance as both have the same interest in maintaining the geographical integrity 
  of the Iraqi state. The US could come dangerously close to military conflict 
  with a NATO ally. All of this was perfectly clear well in advance of the ill-considered 
  invasion. If Bush wasn't smart enough to see it, why didn't his National Security 
  Advisor or his Secretary of State? How did a handful of neocon ideologues hijack 
  US foreign policy? </p>
<p>Bush did not campaign on a neocon policy of conquest in the Middle East. There 
  was no public debate over this policy. The invasion of Iraq was the private 
  agenda of the neocons. Why have the neocons not been held responsible for their 
  treason in abusing their presidential appointments to substitute their personal 
  agenda for America's agenda? Bush has been the neocon's puppet for so long that 
  he is now stuck with responsibility for their horrible mistake. With no way 
  of his own to get out of his trap, his arrogance toward the &quot;irrelevant&quot; 
  UN and our doubting allies has disappeared. Come bail me out, he pleads. </p>
<p>Bush, desperate to be extricated before doom strikes him is experiencing a 
  reality totally different from the chest-thumping of neocon megalomaniacs, such 
  as Charles Krauthammer, who declared the US so powerful as to be able to &quot;reshape, 
  indeed remake, reality on its own.&quot; Bush now knows that he lacks the power 
  to deal with the reality of Iraq. Indeed, Bush cannot even deal with his own 
  appointees.</p>

<p align="center">WEAPONS OF MISDIRECTION<br>
  By Tom Barry <br>
  Guerrilla News.com<br>
  3-9-04</p>
<p><br>
  Getting out of the political quicksand of Iraq, or at least burying the bloody 
  occupation as an embarrassing daily news item, is mission number one for the 
  Bush campaign. Extricating U.S. troops and political capital from the mess the 
  Bush administration created in Iraq may be mission impossible. But the president's 
  political and ideological handlers have proved adept at spinning the administration 
  out of scandals and misadventures. Their operating principle, which they enshrined 
  as official national security strategy, seems to be: the best defense is a good 
  offense. </p>
<p>When you are down in the polls and the &quot;bring em on machismo no longer 
  seems to get the patriotic rise it first did, the Bush team doesn't retreat. 
  It advances with more tough words backed by military muscle and missionary zeal. 
  The Bush administration still has an itchy trigger finger, and is in search 
  of another evildoer to confront. <br>
</p>
<p>Even before the U.S. occupation forces settled into Saddam Hussein's palaces 
  in Baghdad, the neoconservatives who have set the direction of the Bush presidency's 
  radical foreign and military policies were looking TOWARD SYRIA. Before the 
  month is out, it's likely that President Bush will announce new sanctions against 
  Syria--accusing the northern neighbor of Israel, Lebanon, and Iraq of many of 
  the same offenses that were leveled against the Hussein regime in Iraq. The 
  charge list includes developing biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction, 
  condemning the U.S. occupation of Iraq, supporting international terrorism, 
  and succoring anti-U.S. and anti-Israel guerrilla forces. <br>
</p>
<p>Immediately before the Iraq invasion, Undersecretary of State for Arms Control 
  and International Security traveled to Israel and promised Prime Minister Ariel 
  Sharon that &quot;it will be necessary to deal with threats from Syria, Iran, 
  and North Korea afterwards. In April 2003 Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz 
  warned: &quot;There's got to be a change in Syria.&quot; </p>
<p>THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS<br>
</p>
<p>The road to Damascus, which is at the center of the Bush administration,s roadmap 
  for restructuring the Middle East, doesn't run directly from Baghdad. Its starting 
  points are in Washington, Jerusalem/Tel Aviv, and Beirut--charted by the neoconservative 
  think-tanks, the Christian Right, and the right-wing Zionists who move easily 
  back and forth between Capitol Hill and the Middle East. <br>
</p>
<p>THE NEONCONSERVATIVES HARBOR A DEEP SENSE OF HISTORY--ONE THAT IS SHAPED, THEY 
  SAY, BY THE FORCES OF GOOD AND EVIL and the righteous and the appeasers. For 
  the neocons, history also teaches the virtues of certain political strategies, 
  such as the necessity of establishing bipartisan front groups and establishing 
  the legislative foundation for their agendas.</p>
<p> One of the key figures who has set Washington on the road to Damascus is Ziad 
  K. Abdelnour, an expatriate INVESTMENT BANKER from Lebanon who, together with 
  neocon supporters of Israel's Likud Party and the Christian Right, established 
  the U.S. Committee for a Free Lebanon (USCFL) in 1997. The USCFL describes itself 
  as the &quot;cyber-center for Pro-Lebanon Activism. USCFL was one of the leading 
  proponents of the &quot;Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration 
  Act of 2003, which calls for a series of sanctions against Syria and which President 
  Bush signed on December 12, 3003. <br>
</p>
<p>Like Ahmad Chalabi, chief of the London-based and U.S.-financed Iraqi National 
  Congress (INC), the USCFL,s Abdelnour is an expatriate investment banker. He 
  has lobbied the Bush administration and the U.S. Congress for a U.S. foreign 
  policy that mirrors the hard-line position of Israel's Likud Party. Working 
  closely with neocon supporters on Capitol Hill in the late 1990s, Chalabi helped 
  persuade Congress to pass the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which provided support 
  for the Iraqi National Congress and other anti-Saddam Hussein forces. The Iraq 
  Liberation Act of 1998 set the bipartisan foundation for a military-induced 
  regime change in Iraq. In the lead-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, necon polemicists 
  such as Richard Perle, William Kristol, and Bruce Jackson created the Committee 
  for the Liberation of Iraq (CLI) to consolidate bipartisan support for the preventive 
  war. <br>
</p>
<p>The neoconservatives, strongly backed the right-wing Zionist lobby through 
  such groups as the Orthodox Union and the Jewish Institute for National Security 
  Affairs, have followed a similar strategy to advance their agenda for political 
  transformation in Syria and Lebanon. In much the same way that they moved forward 
  their agenda for regime change in Iraq step by step, the neocon advocates for 
  a radical transformation in the Middle East have in the case of Syria and Lebanon 
  also formed a &quot;front group--USCFL--and supported bipartisan legislation 
  that establish the political base for sanctions against Iraq--and eventual U.S. 
  military action. USCFL's page of &quot;selected links recommends just three 
  lobbying organizations: Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, 
  American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and Christian Coalition of America. 
  (4) USCFL, a self-described &quot;non-profit, non-sectarian think tank, states 
  that it aims to rid the Middle East of &quot;dictatorships, radical ideologies, 
  existential conflicts, border disagreements, political violence, and weapons 
  of mass destruction and to do so while abiding with the tenets of the Charter 
  of the United Nations. </p>
<p>(5) (6) USCFL's core supporters,WHICH IT CALLS ITS &quot;GOLDEN CIRCLE,&quot; 
  include several members of the Bush administration: Elliott Abrams, Richard 
  Perle, Paula Dobriansky, Michael Rubin, and David Wurmser. Other prominent neocons 
  in the Golden Circle include Daniel Pipes (Middle East Forum and U.S. Institute 
  for Peace), Frank Gaffney (Center for Security Policy), Jeane Kirkpatrick (AEI) 
  , Michael Ledeen (AEI), David Steinmann (Jewish Institute for National Security 
  Affairs), and Eleana Benador (Middle East Forum). Also included in this circle 
  of those who have donated $1,000 or more to USCFL is Rep. Eliot Engel (R-NY), 
  the congressional representative who was the main sponsor of the Syria Accountability 
  and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003. <br>
</p>
<p>The USCFL lists Amin Gemayel, who as Lebanon's president in 1983 signed an 
  aborted peace treaty with Israel, as a leading supporter. Although there are 
  a few Muslims in USCFL's Golden Circle, most of the Lebanese-Americans associated 
  with USCFL are Christian, including Abdelnour. In its selected links, USCFL 
  includes THE GUARDIANS OF THE CEDARS, a fascistic Christian Right Lebanese organization 
  that has a military wing. The large majority of USCFL supporters, however, are 
  Jewish-Americans. <br>
</p>
<p>USCFL may be &quot;non-sectarian, but its list of core supporters and the &quot;pro-Lebanon 
  groups listed on its website signal its neoconservative and pro-Likud sympathies. 
  Among the organizations interlocked with USCFL's Golden Circle include Foundation 
  for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Project 
  for the New American Century (PNAC), Center for Security Policy (CSP), Middle 
  East Forum, Hudson Institute, and Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs 
  (JINSA). <br>
</p>
<p>In 1999 Abdelnour founded the Middle East Intelligence Bulletin (MEIB), which 
  is the USCFL,s monthly online publication. Michael Rubin is on the editorial 
  board and Gary C. Gambill, an associate with the Middle East Forum and Freedom 
  House, is the editor. In 2002, Daniel Pipes of the Middle East Forum (MEF) became 
  a co-publisher of MEIB. The MEIB concentrates on &quot;internal political developments 
  in the Middle East, especially those that are thinly covered in other English-language 
  publications. (In 2000 Pipes coauthored a jingoistic report with Abdelnour that 
  advocated the use of U.S. military action to force Syria out of Lebanon and 
  to disarm Syria of its alleged weapons of mass destruction. Virtually all 31 
  signatories of this MEF report, which was used to persuade Congress to introduce 
  and pass the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act in 
  2003, are USCFL members, and several became high officials or advisers in the 
  Bush foreign policy team, including AbramsPerle, Feith, Dobrianksy, and Wurmser.</p>
<p> The 2000 report by Pipes and Abdelnour concluded that that &quot;Syrian rule 
  in Lebanon stands in direct opposition to American ideals.&quot; It strongly 
  criticized Washington's policy of engaging Syria rather than confronting it. 
  The Lebanon Study Group of the Middle East Forum advocated harsh economic and 
  diplomatic sanctions. &quot;The Vietnam legacy and the sour memories of dead 
  American Marines in Beirut notwithstanding,&quot; the group observed, &quot;the 
  United States has entered a new era of undisputed military supremacy coupled 
  with an appreciable drop in human losses on the battlefield.&quot; Finally, 
  said the report, &quot;If there is to be decisive action, it will have to be 
  sooner rather than later.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>The Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, 
  which received overwhelming support in both the House and the Senate, is a public 
  law that aims: &quot;To halt Syrian support for terrorism, end its occupation 
  of Lebanon, stop its development of weapons of mass destruction, cease its illegal 
  importation of Iraqi oil and illegal shipments of weapons and other military 
  items to Iraq, and by so doing hold Syria accountable for the serious international 
  security problems it has caused in the Middle East, and for other purposes. 
  It is designed to punish Damascus for its alleged links to terrorist groups 
  and its alleged efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction. It bans all 
  transfers of &quot;dual-use technology to Syria. In addition, the act recommends 
  an arsenal of sanctions against Syria, including: reducing diplomatic contacts 
  with Syria, banning U.S. exports (except food and medicine) to Syria, prohibiting 
  U.S. businesses from investing or operating in Syria, restricting the travel 
  of Syrian diplomats in the United States, banning Syrian aircraft from operating 
  in the United States, and freezing Syrian assets in the United States. Although 
  the bill obligates the executive branch to enact at least two of the recommended 
  sanctions, it does permit the president to waive the sanctions if it is determined 
  that they would harm U.S. national security. <br>
</p>
<p>USCFL commended Rep. Engel for his leadership in moving the bill through the 
  House, and also expressed its special appreciation for the strong support provided 
  by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), and to Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and 
  Rick Santorum (R-PA) &quot;for pioneering it in the Senate. (1) The appointment 
  of David Wurmser, a long-time advocate of U.S. military action against Syria, 
  to the staff of Vice President Cheney in September 2003, followed by the president,s 
  signing of the Syria Accountability act in December were widely regarded as 
  another signal that the U.S. regional restructuring crusade might soon be embarking 
  on the road to Damascus. If the president imposes sanctions against Syria rather 
  than attempting to engage it through diplomatic channels, it,s likely that the 
  Syrian regime will be painted with the same fear-mongering brush used to justify 
  the invasion of Iraq. With Osama bin Laden still on the lam and bedlam in occupied 
  Iraq, the Bush administration needs to refocus public attention on another evildoer--which, 
  not so coincidently, is also the next preferred target of the Likudniks in Israel.
