        by a bunch of money-grubbing colonists who nearly exterminated the native 
        population because the Indians would not live like 'civilized' white men. 
        They built the South on the backs of black slaves and poor whites. The 
        North built its commerce on children and immigrants who worked from daylight 
        to dark, were poorly fed and paid, and whose only reward was to die young.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In West Virginia, mineral rights 
        were swindled away and the citizens' reward was spending the biggest part 
        of their short lives underground breathing coal dust and dodging slate 
        falls, if they were lucky, and owing their souls to the company store.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus Christ was the same fellow 
        who threw the money changers out of the temple and said it was easier 
        for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to 
        enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. If he were walking the earth today, 
        I doubt he would have any truck with the likes of...that gang of thugs 
        who run Washington, nor do I think he would embrace the so-called 'Christian 
        principles' (they all) seem so fond of.&quot; </font>James Toler, The

      <p>WASHINGTON, May 22, 2004__At a recent news conference and in a new book 
        by Bob Woodward, President Bush conveys a sense that when it comes to 
        foreign policy, he's on a mission from God.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
<div align="left">
      <p>&quot;I HAVE THIS BELIEF, STRONG BELIEF,, THAT FREEDOM IS NOT THIS COUNTRY'S 
        GIFT TO THE WORLD. FREEDOM IS THE ALMIGHTY'S GIFT TO EVERY MAN AND WOMAN 
        IN THIS WORLD,&quot; Bush said during a news conference last week. &quot;AND 
        AS THE GREATEST POWER ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH, WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION 
        TO HELP SPREAD THAT FREEDOM.&quot;</p>
      
    </div>

  <div align="left">
<div align="left">
      <p>Nearly four years into his presidency, BUSH'S STRONG CHRISTIAN BELIEFS 
        are well-known. But through Woodward's book, and the president's own words, 
        Americans are learning how Bush's faith drives his decisions, political 
        and religion experts said....</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
<div align="left">
      <p>In <i>Plan of Attack</i>, Woodward's book, Bush describes praying after 
        giving the go-ahead to launch the war against Iraq. The president told 
        Woodward he wasn't praying to &quot;justify war based upon God...NEVERTHELESS, 
        IN MY CASE I PRAY THAT I BE A GOOD MESSENGER OF HIS WILL AS POSSIBLE,&quot; 
        Bush told Woodward. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(And indeed 
        he has been)</font>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
<div align="left">
      <p>The president's revelations have made some uneasy. Independent presidential 
        candidate Ralph Nader has called Bush a &quot;Messianic militarist&quot; 
        for mixing religion and policy in his public statements and interviews 
        about the U.S. role in Iraq. &quot;He's an unsuitable officeholder,&quot; 
        Nader said. &quot;Talk about separation of church and state; it's not 
        separated at all in Bush's brain. We want him to make decisions as a secular 
        president.&quot;</p>
      
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
<div align="left">
      <p>White House officials dismissed Nader's claims. &quot;The president talks 
        about the principle of the separation of church and state and how it is 
        the bedrock cornerstone of our democracy,&quot; said Trent Duffy, a White 
        House spokesman. &quot;He does believe that deeply. Having said that, 
        he has a strong personal faith, BUT HE LEAVES THAT AT THE RESIDENCE BEFORE 
        HE ENTERS THE OVAL OFFICE.&quot; ...</p>
      
    </div>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
<div align="left">Bush's mix of religion and policy could be harming the United 
      State's ability to get more international help in Iraq, according to James 
      Hudnut-Beumier, the dean of Vanderbilt University's Divinity School. &quot;It 
      probably further damages prospects for the internationalization of the Iraq 
      solution,&quot; he said. &quot;Almost nowhere else would a head of government 
      actually speak about the Almighty being the reason for the push of a foreign 
      policy aim....&quot;</div>
