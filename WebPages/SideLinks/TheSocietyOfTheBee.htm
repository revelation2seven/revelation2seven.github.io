<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">INTRODUCTION</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the years in which the nineteenth 
  century drew to its close, Maurice Maeterlinck, the Belgian dramatist and Nobel 
  Prize winner, spent summer in a square country house set among beech trees and 
  surrounded by the grain fields and orchards of a Norman plateau. Here, one day, 
  he laid down a wild-bee book by J. Henri Fabre and exclaimed: &quot;What marvels 
  could be written about all that!&quot; A few days later, Maeterlinck began work 
  on his classic &quot;La Vie Des Abeilles, The Life of the Bee.&quot; ...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was written, quite literally, 
  among the bees it celebrates. Georgette Leblanc tells us how the author worked 
  through the summer, sitting at a table spread with a green cloth on which were 
  set little dishes of honey to attract the humming insects through an open window 
  from the hollyhocks, phlox and larkspurs outside. Individual bees were marked 
  for identification with small dabs of bright colored paint...At this time Maeterlinck 
  was in his late thirties. He was already widely known for his symbolic plays...and 
  for his volume of mystical and philosophical essays...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1887 Maeterlinck settled in Paris 
  and became identified with a group of symbolist poets...In 1911, Maeterlinck 
  was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and on his seventieth birthday, in 
  1932, he was given the rank of Count by the King of Belgium. With the Nazi invasion 
  of France, in 1940, Maeterlinck, then seventy-eight, fled with his wife to America, 
  returning to Europe at the close of the war. He died in Nice, France, on May 
  6, 1949. His villa there he had named Les Abeilles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This then was the man whose study 
  of the hive and its mysteries had so permanently enriched the literature of 
  natural history. The book, itself, begins in a beguilingly simple and matter-of-fact 
  fashion. And throughout all its poetry and philosophical speculation there runs 
  a strong thread of fact and observation. However, The Life of the Bee was never 
  intended to serve as a practical guide to agriculture. Nor is it an encyclopedic 
  treatise on the habits of bees. Nor are all of its statements completely in 
  accord with modern knowledge. It is book in which, in an inevitable way, science 
  and philosophy and fancy intermingle. Moralists long have seen in bees models 
  of industry and foresight; poets have long extolled their civic virtues. If 
  Maeterlinck moralizes it is philosophically. HE IS ABSORBED BY THE MYSTERIES 
  OF LIFE, THE LIFE OF THE BEE AND THE LIFE OF MAN. IN THE MICROCOSM OF THE HIVE 
  HE OBSERVES THE LAW AND ORDER THAT RUN THROUGH THE UNIVERSE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bee, in many parts of the world, 
  was linked with the lives of ancient people. Babylonians built their temples 
  on ground consecrated with honey and, in Peru, the Incas offered honey as a 
  sacrifice to he Sun. The Rig-Veda, sacred book of the East set down in Sanskrit 
  between 2000 and 3000 B.C., gives the honeybee a prominent place, as do almost 
  all the great books of religion. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bee, according to Mohammedan 
  teaching, was the only creature directly spoken to by the Lord. In Egypt ancient 
  carvings along the Nile frequently depict the bee and during the days of Greece 
  and Rome honey formed the chief sugar supply of the world. Mead, a honey-made 
  beverage that antedated beer, was the prized drink of the Middle Ages. It was 
  mead that, in the sagas of Norse mythology, Odin and Thor and the heroes slain 
  in battle, quaffed in Valhalla.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The close linkage of man and bee 
  through the ages is reflected in innumerable superstitions that surround the 
  hive and the activity of its occupants...PEASANT GIRLS IN CENTRAL EUROPE USED 
  TO LEAD THEIR LOVERS PAST BEEHIVES, BELIEVING AN OLD SUPERSTITION, THAT IF A 
  MAN WHO HAD BEEN UNFAITHFUL SHOULD PASS BY THE INSECTS WOULD RUSH OUT AND STING 
  HIM...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IF A SWARM LANDED ON A HOUSE, A BELIEF 
  OF THE BRITISH ISLES HAD IT, GOOD LUCK WOULD COME TO THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE. 
  IF, HOWEVER, THE SWARM DESCENDED ON A ROTTEN BRANCH MISFORTUNE WAS FORETOLD...</font></p>

    15:1-7).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AND IF THE BEES CAME DOWN IN A DEAD 
  TREE THE SUPERSTITIOUS SAW A PORTENT OF DEATH IN THE OWNER'S FAMILY. At various 
  times honeybees have been thought to be skilled in astronomy, to have uncanny 
  ability in predicting rain...Probably the superstition that persisted longest, 
  finding an echo on many pages of ancient literature, WAS THE BELIEF THAT SWARMS 
  OF BEES WERE ENGENDERED WITHIN THE DECAYING CARCASSES OF OXEN...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/behemoth.gif" width="671" height="287"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Behold now Behemoth, which I made with thee: he eateth grass 
  as an Ox...Job 40:15.</b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Out of the darkness 
  of superstition into the light of science the facts of bee-life have slowly 
  progressed. Many men have been part of its evolution....&quot;Man truly became 
  the master of bees, although furtively, without their knowledge; directing all 
  things without giving an order, receiving obedience but not recognition.&quot; 
  The bee, through all ages of its association with man, has never become domesticated 
  in the sense that a dog or cow is domesticated. It still lives its wild free 
  life. It admits of guidance ONLY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ITS INHERITED PATTERN 
  OF INSTINCTS. The veiled enigmas of those instincts absorbed Maeterlinck; they 
  also absorb the modern scientists. For in the everyday life of the hive, so 
  easily observed, science has found a fertile field for probing the mysteries 
  of animal behavior.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How, Von Frisch wondered, 
  are bees able to inform their fellows of the location of a new supply of food?...Each 
  began a curious round dance, circling to the left, then to the right, repeating 
  this over and over for half a minute at a time. In great excitement other workers 
  crowded around it. They trooped after it, stretching out their antennae to catch 
  the flower scent adhering to its body. Then one by one, they left the hive. 
  Soon these bees,,,appeared at the spot where the food was found. THE LANGUAGE 
  OF THE DANCE had sent them out in search of flowers of a certain perfume nearby.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was the procedure 
  when food was not far off. When it was more remote, a different kind of dance 
  occurred. This time the returning bee ran in a straight line, wagging its abdomen 
  rapidly from side to side, before it circled to the left. Another tail-wagging 
  run in the same place and in the same direction, then a circle to the right 
  and the run repeated, then a circle to the left. This went on and on while excitement 
  mounted in the surrounding bees. The line of the tail-wagging run, Von Frisch 
  found, indicated to the other bees the direction of the food. If he rotated 
  the comb during such a dance, he observed the direction of the run was continually 
  changed like the shifting needle of a compass that is turned in the hand...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But even more was told 
  by the dancing bees. THE SUN IS THE GREAT SIGNPOST ON THE AERIAL HIGHWAY OF 
  THESE INSECTS. AND THE DANCE OF THE RETURNED WORKER INDICATED THE RELATIONSHIP 
  OF THE SUN TO THE ROUTE THAT WAS TO BE TAKEN...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peering into the veiled 
  life of the bee, Maeterlinck sought to fathom its enigmas with a poet's insight. 
  Von Frisch, with his probing spotlight of research, has since illuminated obscure 
  aspects of hive-life. BUT STILL--BEYOND THE POET'S INSIGHT AND THE SCIENTIST'S 
  VISION--LIES AN ULTIMATE MYSTERY, THE BEGINNING AND EVOLUTION OF THE INSTINCTS 
  WHOSE MANIFESTATIONS ARE SO MEMORABLY SET FORTH IN 'THE LIFE OF THE BEE.'&quot;</font></p>
