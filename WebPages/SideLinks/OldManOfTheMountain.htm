  <br>
  <b>The Old Man of the Mountain fell from the mountain today.</b> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>High above the Franconia Notch gateway to northern New Hampshire there is an 
  old man. He has been described as a relentless tyrant, a fantastic freak, and 
  a learned philosopher, feeble and weak about the mouth and of rarest beauty, 
  stern and solemn, one of the most remarkable wonders of the mountain world. 
</p>
<p>Daniel Webster once said, ...&quot;Men hang out their signs indicative of their 
  respective trades; shoe makers hang out a gigantic shoe; jewelers a monster 
  watch, and the dentist hangs out a gold tooth; but up in the Mountains of New 
  Hampshire, God Almighty has hung out a sign to show that there He makes men.&quot; 
  Thus it happens that New Hampshire has her Profile, &quot;The Old Man of the 
  Mountain,&quot; sublimely outlined against the western sky; a sign unique, distinctive, 
  and inspirational as to the kind of men the sons of the Granite State should 
  be.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Oldman2.jpg" width="300" height="255"></p>
<p>The Old Man of the Mountain has several names including &quot;The Profile&quot;, 
  &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;, &quot;The Old Man,&quot; and &quot;The Old 
  Man of the Mountains&quot;. </p>
<p>The Profile is composed of Conway red granite and is an illusion formed by 
  five ledges, that when lined up correctly give the appearance of an old man 
  with an easterly gaze, clearly distinct and visible from only a very small space 
  near Profile Lake. When viewed from other locations in Franconia Notch, the 
  same five ledges have a very rough and ragged appearance, and there is no suggestion 
  of The Profile.</p>
<p>Geological opinion is that The Profile on Profile Mountain is supposed to have 
  been brought forth partly as the result of the melting and slipping away action 
  of the ice sheet that covered the Franconia Mountains at the end of the glacial 
  period, and partly by the action of the frost and ice in crevices, forcing off, 
  and moving about certain rocks and ledges into profile forming positions. It 
  is supposed that the Old Man of the Mountain was completed during the latter 
  part of the post glacial period, from 2,000 to 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The Old Man is formed on a shoulder of Profile Mountain, which juts out abruptly 
  into space, some 1200 feet above Profile Lake. It is composed of five layers 
  of granite ledge, one exactly above the other, the lateral distance being 25 
  feet. Of these five layers one forms the chin, another the upper lip, a third 
  the nose and two layers make up the forehead. The Old Man has been measured 
  as being forty feet and five inches in height. It is all together, just as it 
  appears to be when viewed from the road or lake below.<br>

<blockquote> 
  <p>On the crest of a mighty mountain <br>
    Looking over the lake below, <br>
    A face with a human expression <br>
    Watches many a century go. </p>
  <p>It was made from a mountain of granite <br>
    With the skill of a sculptor's hand, <br>
    And guards the green valley below it <br>
    As time passes over the land. </p>
  <p>At dusk when the birds cease their carols <br>
    And the wind murmurs through the trees, <br>
    There's a sense of sadness about you, <br>
    As you stand in the evening breeze. </p>
  <p>You feel that a great respect's due him - <br>
    So mighty beneath the blue sky, <br>
    There are few who have not been inspired <br>
    By that face as they've passed it by. </p>
  <p>And to me, as to Daniel Webster, <br>
    The thought comes now and again <br>
    That in the great State of New Hampshire <br>
    The Master of Sculptors makes men. </p>

    <b>OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN COLLAPSES</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p> (Concord, N.H.) The Old Man of the Mountain, the enduring symbol of the State 
  of New Hampshire, is no more. Some time between Friday evening and Saturday 
  morning, the stone profile that draws hundreds of thousands of visitors to Franconia 
  Notch State Park each year collapsed. On Saturday, May 3 at approximately 7:30 
  a.m., two Franconia Notch State Park employees noticed that the Old Man of the 
  Mountain had collapsed. At this time it appears as though the forehead and the 
  nose are missing.</p>
<p>Currently, state officials including Governor Craig R. Benson, Department of 
  Resources and Economic Development Commissioner George Bald, the State Police, 
  Department of Fish and Game and Franconia Notch State Park employees are assessing 
  the damage and ensuring that there are no safety issues.</p>
<p>The weather has been extremely harsh in Franconia Notch over the last few days. 
  High winds, fog and heavy rain, along with freezing temperatures overnight, 
  may have all contributed to the collapse, although no official cause can be 
  determined until a full inspection of the site takes place.</p>

<p>The sun no longer shines in the land of forever war.The moon with one last 
  wearisome look, took her silver dust and escaped to a distant galaxy, to dance 
  amongst the stars of peace. The Old Man of the Mountain, his craggy face worn 
  and polished from many a storm, wrapped a garland of pine boughs, intertwined 
  with lilac blooms and grape vines around her fragile frame and walked with her 
  along the Milky Way in the hushed silence of timeless majesty.</p>
<p> An odd couple to be sure, this man of granite fortitude, courage and comforting 
  embrace. His deeply lined countenance, bore the worn pathways of torrential 
  rains, biting sleet, and winter's blizzards isolating loneliness. Summer's warmth 
  would see him brush the last iced tear from darkened eyes, no man could see. 
  He, the guardian of northern forests, noted man's intrusive plunder. Decades 
  passed, his eyes sunk deeper, that men below of mirth and greed might not see 
  an Old Man weep.</p>
<p> In anguished watchfulness, he sobbed, as friends below; the bridal pines, 
  the swaying birch, the ancient oaks who saw his birth, the mischievous hemlocks, 
  and autumn's symphony of youthful maples cried out in silent sepulcher, that 
  they be saved from massacre. The Old Man knew that men of heartless, cruel contempt, 
  could not hear the cries of trees. And so they came with saws and hatchets, 
  logging trucks and big machines. <br>
</p>
<p>They chopped and hacked, stripped and raped, until the desecration was complete. 
  Far below he saw the carnage, of lifeless skeletal murdered friends. Gone the 
  song birds joyful laughter, woodland creatures, the trees soft chatter. Parking 
  lots, and ribbon concrete, tourist shops, neon motels, and rowdy tourists; dressed 
  in plaids and argil socks, came in cars, trucks, and trailers grand to photograph 
  the Old Man's grief. <br>
</p>
<p>Some climbed upon his lofty brow, their vulgar laughter echoed loud over consecrated 
  ground that held a mighty massacre. They could not see nor did they care, of 
  poisoned streams and toxic air. He alone could hear the cries of carnage in 
  the forests north. Then came the semis filled with waste, garbage, from surrounding 
  towns and concrete canyons out of state. Burning gasses filled the air, it's 
  then he knew his Watch was ended. <br>
</p>
<p>She came to him one moonlit night, and under clouds heavy midst, he heaved 
  a final sob and left. No one heard him leave in thunder, he simply took her 
  in his arms, as chariots of stars carried them off. They traveled through the 
  moonless night over oceans, rivers, and streams polluted. Over forests and mountains 
  plundered, and war torn lands soaked with blood. They heard the mighty sounds 
  of missiles, bombs, and guns and little shredded children weeping.</p>

</p>
<p>She translucent, ever changing, sometimes silver, sometimes waning, held his 
  blackened granite hand, light and darkness now were one. His scars visible, 
  hers hidden in craters deep, over a turquoise planet now filled with sorrow. 
  And just before the Man of Granite and Moonlit Maiden took their leave, to walk 
  along the Milky Way- they stopped and whispered to the watchful warriors left 
  behind,&quot; We go to find a place for thee, a place of sun and moon and stars, 
  of clapping trees and pristine streams. A place that's absent of all strife, 
  where lamb and lion play together. Stay the course and do not falter, keep the 
  light and never fear, WE'LL SOON RETURN WITH THE PRINCE OF PEACE.&quot; <br>
