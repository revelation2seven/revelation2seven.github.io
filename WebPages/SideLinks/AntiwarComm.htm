<p align="center"><font size="+2">The Anti-War Movement</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+2">at Union Square</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This Socialist lady was on the steps at Union Square park, 
  being screamed at by the patriotic mob because of her group's outspoken opposition 
  to the impending war in Afghanistan. I found my way next to her and said: &quot;I 
  don't know if you have a religious opinion about these matters--she shot back, 
  'No!'--but it says in the Scriptures, 'Blessed are you when men shall revile 
  you, and say all manner of evil things about you for righteousness' sake.'&quot; 
  She softened some and said &quot;Thank you,&quot; and then found refuge among 
  the rest of her group. Several of us spent the rest of the day there, after 
  she and her friends left, taking some of the same heat, just as we had been 
  since the towers fell and the High Holy Days began a few days afterwards. (How 
  is it written: <i>Blow the trumpet in Zion, sound an alarm throughout all of 
  God's holy mountain...</i>Joel 2:1,2). She and her comrades were courageous 
  in their attempts to articulate what they believed to be the deeper socio-political 
  and historic implications--all the causes-and-effects--of these unfolding events. 
  The mob (not yet like the ones to come), blind and deaf, kept shouting back 
  its litany of slogans and epithets. Some unwittingly took the bait and began 
  to shout back. Nothing was resolved. America and the world moved closer to war 
  that day, and every day since. (Joel 3:9-16, KJV). Perhaps by the time this 
  letter is read the first young men and women will already be returning in body 
  bags.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">That weekend, at the demonstration in Washington, the situation 
  was the same. For those who had never been to an anti-war (or anti-anything) 
  demonstration it was an exhilarating experience. There were the young people, 
  the colorful banners, the musicians and drummers and dancers, the Bread and 
  Puppet and street theater groups, all sharing some collective belief that their 
  presence there might make a real difference (which in the end it will of course, 
  but), which it did not that day. The government and the media have become very 
  skillful since the 60s in isolating and marginalizing all such activities, keeping 
  them out of the mainstream of American consciousness. If one, however, had been 
  involved in the civil-rights and anti-war movements of those years, they would 
  have noticed immediately what was missing this weekend--a spiritual voice. There 
  were no sound religious (and by this we actually mean <i>prophetic</i>) opinions 
  being expressed there that day, partly because those who organized that day's 
  activities by and large reject such sentiments, and are not warm to them. The 
  religious, on the other hand, are by and large quite naive, and uncertain about 
  matters of war themselves; and even when they voice their opposition to it they 
  seem reluctant, or embarrassed, to get to the heart of the issue--afraid of 
  making real waves--and wind up leaving God out of the equation as well. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(It is now March, 2003. Despite the demonstrations that are 
  happening everywhere in the world against America's war in the Middle East, 
  the preparation for war continues...No! it is actually at this very moment under 
  way. <i>Shock and Awe </i>are presently raining down over Iraq...</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1"><img src="../../UsedImages/ShockAndAwe.gif" width="350" height="464">. 
  </font></p>
<p align="center"><b>Revelation 13:13.</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">The images are frightening and surreal. They are, nevertheless, 
  the ongoing fulfillment of the prophecy at Revelation 13:13. The protests could 
  not stop it. (One should not be accused of fundamentalism here, because we resort 
  to biblical texts and use the language of the Scriptures to interpret what is 
  happening in the world, but that is the problem one runs into when encountering 
  those on the Left. These hear the language and are immediately repulsed by it. 
  They mistake it for the same language that is being tossed around in fundamentalist's 
  circles, and actually being used by the religious and political Right to justify 
  these events, and want no part of it. It is quite understandable. Nevertheless, 
  it is apparent that the kingdom of the Beast is already in place and that the 
  battles leading to <i>Armageddon</i> have already begun. There is no other way, 
  outside of divine reasoning, of making sense of the things that are now unfolding 
  in the world). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">L</font><font size="+1">ike their adversaries in the corporate-military 
  state, and the Religious Right that supports it, the Left by and large has no 
  use for the prophetic voice, and therefore are left without a clear interpretation 
  of these events and remain without any means of making themselves heard beyond 
  their own political circles. All the secular rhetoric that we heard in Washington 
  on the 29th, despite all of its altruistic intent, is just that--politics, the 
  very thing the American state feeds on, thus hardly threatening to the ruling 
  powers because it does not touch the heartstrings or the mindset of the American 
  people themselves. (Condoleeza Rice, in a recent response to the rising tide 
  of protest in America, shrugged it off saying that the right to protest and 
  speak up is the reason America is going to war in the first place. This rationale 
  touches the thinking of the average American). At best such protests are an 
  annoyance to the ruling establishment, but hardly capable of turning the rudder 
  of American consciousness, or of ultimately carrying the day. And while religion 
  must be held suspect at every turn, I rather suspect that our friends on the 
  Left are more caught up in the intrigues of resistance--in the <i>Bohemian milieu</i> 
  as it is--than it is in achieving real results, or of affecting a true, meaningful 
  spiritual revolution in this country. Even Gorbachev realized that such a thing 
  could only happen in America, but it cannot happen by ignoring the voice of 
  the Spirit Herself, who--along with Her great powerful consort, the Heavenly 
  Father, risen up everywhere in the earth now--is bringing all these things to 
  pass to begin with (Matthew, chapter 24...KJV). These are the Divine Realities 
  we speak of on the opening page of this work. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FEB. 16, 2003__Millions of protesters 
    rallied at the weekend in Europe, Asia and the US to oppose American plans 
    to attack Iraq, in the largest anti-war demonstrations since the Vietnam war

    large turnouts in the UK, Germany and France. </font></p>

    the growing popular opposition, insisting that the administration of President

    would not alter US determination to confront Saddam Hussein and help the Iraqi 
    people, either with broad international support or with a narrower &quot;coalition 
    of the willing.&quot;</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON. Feb.18, 2003__President 
    Bush dismissed antiwar demonstrations today as a factor in his plans for confronting 
    Iraq and pressed ahead with a strategy to persuade reluctant allies that United 
    Nations weapons inspections would not secure the disarmament of Saddam Hussein. 
    In his first public comments about antiwar demonstrations by millions of people 
    over the weekend in the United States and abroad, Mr. Bush said his overriding 
    goal was to protect the American people and that leadership sometimes involved 
    bucking public opinion.</font></p>

  the United Nations in New York City said: &quot;Send Jimmy, not bombs.&quot; 
  Some have even suggested a Jimmy Carter For President Movement. This too is 
  prophecy unfolding. It represents a flight many will unknowingly and unwarily 
  take, from the blatant Darkness of the Bush administration if you will, to a 
  state of Darkness that is subtle, and far more dangerous because it uses the 
  rhetoric, and speaks the language of peace and reconciliation [conflict resolution], 
  while it continues virtually unopposed to extend the American ethos and America's 
  [not so secret] global and economic agenda throughout the world at large. Many 
  in the Peace Community believe Carter is speaking the same language as they 
  are, and were even instrumental in his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize 
  which he has just been awarded. While Carter speaks of peace, he is not a pacifist. 
  He is, in fact, what may be called an &quot;extreme warrior,&quot; a nuclear 
  warrior to be exact. He is for peace in the morning, so long as his agenda for 
  peace remains viable, but will, among many others in the Western world, consent 
  to war at the end of the day. &quot;He said published reports that he had signed 
  a petition opposing the war in Iraq were wrong...He didn't comment on Powell's 
  address, but said Powell was 'caught in difficult circumstances'&quot;).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> These great momentous (and wholly surreal) events are an unfolding 
  of Divine Will, and are following precisely the historical script that was laid 
  out in the mind of the seers and prophets, and all of the shamans of the earth, 
  since the earliest times of recorded history. And because it is the religious 
  institutions of this country themselves--those who claim to be the custodians 
  of these ancient records--that are providing the great American Beast with all 
  of its motivation and power, any attempt to shed a light on this unholy relationship, 
  and to sever it, must be framed in the language the people and these institutions 
  understand--the language of the Sacred Scriptures. And not only that, but these 
  things must be expressed with a heart that beats the same as those who are in 
  bondage to it all, with a heart that has been encompassed itself with these 
  same social and religious infirmities. America is a religious nation, and is 
  caught in the very throes, in the down-draughts if you will, of its own religious 
  imagination. The purely-secular mind, and purely-political, can never resonate 
  with this reality. Nor is it able to explore the landscape of the higher spiritual 
  world that most Americans so confusedly believe they have found here on this 
  continent--for which so many are also willing to die--having exchanged the pure 
  Light for the gross (but subtle) Darkness as they have (Isaiah 5). If the Religious 
  Right, however, is smitten with idolatry and child-like fear, and is (almost 
  unwittingly) complicit in crimes against humanity, wholly attached to the American 
  military and economic order as it is, the Left suffers from intellectual pride 
  and downright disbelief in transcendent matters. The Right believes that God 
  is on their side. The Left believes only in itself. It is sometimes difficult 
  to say which of the two is more conflicted. </font>(It's lonely out here in

<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Cal Thomas</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;peace movement,&quot; 
    moribund since the Vietnam War, is trying to jump-start itself over the conflict 
    in the Persian Gulf. Back from the graves of obscurity they come, from Daniel 
    Elsberg to Ramsay Clark, chanting the same old tired slogans that sound like 
    mantras in the mouths of some Near-East mystic. They hope to reach a crescendo 
    with a &quot;massive&quot; nationwide protest next month.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The peace movement always tries 
    to seize the moral high ground by declaring itself against all war. This time, 
    there's a new twist. Aware that the polls show overwhelming support for President 
    Bush and the way he is handling the war, the peace movement says it is against 
    the war--but for the troops. Nice try, but it won't work. The troops and the 
    war go together.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ethel Kennedy, who usually keeps 
    quiet about such things, demonstrated the wisdom of that practice by telling 
    Ladies Home Journal that America is guilty of &quot;aggression&quot; in the 
    Persian Gulf. That's another thing the peace movement is famous for: blaming 
    America first. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The demonstrators are constantly 
    referred to in the press as &quot;anti-war,&quot; but this is a serious misnomer. 
    Everyone detests war. The difference is that most of us are willing to accept 
    war if it is the only way to protect our highest values. These demonstrators 
    see no values worth fighting for.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some peace activists tell us that 
    &quot;war never solves anything.&quot; That will come as a surprise to those 
    who fought World War II and to the people of Nazi-occupied Europe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To be &quot;anti-war&quot; strips 
    life of true moral concerns and accepts a view of man that denies the possibilities 
    of human evil. To acknowledge evil is to acknowledge is too acknowledge goodness 
    and the necessity to oppose evil's agenda, which seeks to impose itself on 
    the good.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The peace movement pretends that 
    negotiation, not confrontation, will produce the better world they seek, but 
    that presumes each side has equally good intentions. What to do when one side 
    is good (or at least not evil) and the other side is evil incarnate, they 
    never say.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the many problems of the 
    &quot;peace movement&quot; is its lack of ideas. It is an arid philosophy, 
    devoid of content. As G.K. Chesterton noted, &quot;The real point against 
    pacifism is that it is not a cause at all, but only a weakening of all causes. 
    It does not announce any aim; it only announces that it will never use certain 
    means in pursuing any aim. It does not define its goal; it only defines a 
    stopping place, beyond which nobody must go in the search for any goal.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michael Novak, a rabid anti-war 
    activist who wrote speeches for George McGovern during the Vietnam War, changed 
    his view when he saw the boat people and the suffering of the Vietnamese under 
    communism. &quot;If love demands the defense of others (such that a failure 
    to defend them can be a sin),&quot; Novak writes, &quot;both love and justice 
    also command self-defense. Peace is sometimes unjust; war is sometimes morally 
    imperative.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The peace movement is off base 
    in the Persian Gulf conflict. It would tolerate the rape of Kuwait and the 
    killing of innocent Kuwaitis because &quot;peace&quot; is preferable to fighting 
    for an ideal. Reinhold Neibuhr accurately characterized their thinking: &quot;There 
    are two ways of denying our responsibilities to our fellow men. There is the 
    way of imperialism, seeking to dominate them by our power. The other is the 
    way of isolationism, seeking to withdraw from our responsibilities to them.&quot; 
    Freedom cannot be separated from responsibility. Those who are free but fail 
    to act responsibly when tyrants move move against the innocent cannot remain 
    free for long, because totalitarians will not coexist with free people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conflict will remain a fact of 
    human existence because of a flaw in the human character. The peace movement 
    doesn't understand that because it sees self-preservation, rather than the 
    preservation of ideas, as the highest good.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">To the antiwar community in America,</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To that part of the civil-rights movement as well. To all who 
  are pressing into God's kingdom. Stop! just long enough to see that your rhetoric 
  is outworn. You are without power to affect any further change. You are without 
  insight, and cut off from your (spiritual) roots (from the mysteries of the 
  Tree of Life). And because of it the prophets of Ba'al are winning the day. 
  Cal Thomas, one of the many voices of those who are presently imagining a divine 
  victory for America and its conservative political (and &quot;christian&quot;) 
  agenda, completely without insight himself, is nevertheless able to say in a 
  recent article entitled Those Peace Doves are Flying Blind: &quot;Back from 
  the graves they come...chanting the same old tired slogans.&quot; &quot;The 
  peace movement,&quot; he chides, &quot;always tries to seize the moral high 
  ground by declaring itself against all war. But this time there is a new twist...The 
  peace movement says it is against the war...but for the troops.&quot; &quot;Nice 
  try,&quot; he says, but it won't work. The troops and the war go together.&quot; 
  It seems that he is right, and that the sentiments of the American people support 
  him. Well, why can't the peace movement seize the moral high ground? Because, 
  like its warring counterparts on the Right, it has forsaken the Law (the Torah) 
  and the very words of the prophets that have sprung from it. It has grown weary 
  of God, and confused, and no longer believes what God has proclaimed of Himself 
  through the prophets. The antiwar movement is lost in its own rhetoric, and 
  much of it in a wash of ethics, and finds itself powerless and imprisoned as 
  a result of its constant attempst to assimilate the doctrines and philosophies 
  of fallen men with the precepts of God. The process got reversed along the way 
  and it is we who got converted. And we don't know how to get un-converted without 
  being charged with treason...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But accept the charge we must, for in the process we have set 
  aside the transcendent mystery of the awesomeness and terrible majesty of God's 
  Presence in the affairs of humankind. Isn't this the meaning of the events of 
  the 20th century? Are there any powers or principalities, or does any single 
  event transpire in the earth that is not ordained of God? (Not with God's &quot;reluctant 
  permission,&quot; as so many childishly reason, but realizing that all these 
  events are direct manifestations of the Presence of God itself). Is not God 
  bringing history to bear upon the mind of humanity, exactly as the prophets 
  said He/She would? (Just because those on the political and religious Right 
  are obsessed with the Bible, and use it to justify their worldly agendas, it 
  is no sign that those of us on the other side of the Tree should abandon it). 
  Did it not promise to unfold in a series of apocalyptic events? Well? Did not 
  the apostle speak clearly of <i>the terror of the Lord</i>? And does not the 
  birth of the coming age require the end of this age, this age of darkness, oppression, 
  injustice, destruction and death?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> If these things are so, then we may rightly ask Cal Thomas 
  and his champion, the president, and all those advisors of his who are claiming 
  to be sons of God: why do they not fear God, and the things that God is bringing 
  to pass in the earth? (Romans 13:1-4). And, of course, they will give some earthly 
  response but the simple truth is, they do not believe in God, at least not in 
  the God who is One. They have come over the wall into the Judeao-Christian state 
  of mind--not as the Good Shepherd who leads the flock by <i>still waters</i>--but 
  <i>to kill, to steal, and destroy. </i>(John 10:9,10). And now they are caught. 
  They have declared it themselves. They are for the war, but not for the troops...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Bodies.jpg" width="300" height="210"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> (George W. Bush, the son, says that he has labored hard, and 
  prayed hard, over the idea of sending these young men and women over seas to 
  die--but he has decided to send them anyway). What do they claim happens to 
  the souls of these young men and women fallen in battle? Do they imagine that 
  they are transported to Paradise? Valhalla, yes, Paradise no. How could they 
  be? For <i>as the soul thinks, so is it</i>. These young men and women are engaged 
  in the wrong war, the war against other mortal beings. One must be engaged in 
  the Greater Holy War, the war against &quot;Self,&quot; to attain Paradise--indeed, 
  they must be engaged in the Greater Holy War against human involvement in war 
  itself to attain it. For only a true pacifist is able to open the doors of Heaven. 
  And only a true pacifist will be able to fight their way through those events 
  that are about to unfold in the world, attaining in the victory both the world 
  to come, and the life to come. But this spiritual twist in ideas is complicated 
  for many because the religious institutions they have come to trust in have 
  long ago turned the teachings of the Gospel, and particularly Christ's Sermon 
  on the Mount upside down (Matthew 5:1-17), and have long ago given the world 
  a different set of precepts than the ones that were handed down by the early 
  Church--(which now command unquestioning obedience to Caesar, which now partake 
  in the politics of men, that approve of, and bless the rich and the powerful, 
  and which now allow us to participate in the wars that men wage one against 
  the other--or rather, that God wages against men because of their refusal to 
  cease from war itself).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">They are caught because of the fierce and historic delusion 
  God has spread upon Western civilization, upon all who have followed the leaders 
  of Christendom into these times...<i>because they have believed a lie</i>: one 
  that has grown powerful, convincing men that they may participate in both the 
  works of Light and the works of Darkness at the same time, that they may sit 
  at both tables, and drink from both cups, and swing two swords, and that in 
  the name of the God of Life they may perform the works of destruction and death. 
  This is <i>The Mystery of Iniquity </i>fulfilled (2 Thessalonians 2:3-12; 1 
  Corinthians 10:20-22 KJV). And that God would not sever these children of Darkness 
  from the children of Light in the last days. (Hebrews 4:12; Matthew 13:1-30). 
  God has led them to believe that it is in their own hands to bring about their 
  own fallen notions of peace and justice in the world, their <i>new world order</i>, 
  all in face of the Scriptures which say: <i>Their feet run to evil, and they 
  make haste to shed innocent blood</i>. They say that these words apply to Saddam 
  Hussein, not themselves. They look into the mirror darkly. The Qur'an says: 
  <i>When it is said to them, make not mischief on the earth, they say, We, we 
  only want to make peace. Of a surety they are the ones who make mischief but 
  they realize it not. </i>(Sura 2.11,12). It is also written: <i>Freely or otherwise, 
  the denizens of the heavens and of the earth submit to Him</i>. (Sura 3.83). 
  Is Hussein free to observe the higher precepts of Christ? Has he the mind of 
  Christ? Has he completed the pilgrimage? No, he is the slave of God, a vessel 
  of perfect disorder in the Hand of God. For what end? To draw those who profess 
  to be in order, but who are not, up against Him in battle. <i>Wasting and destruction 
  are in their paths, the Ways of Peace know they not</i>. (Isaiah 59:7,8). It 
  also says: <i>He will keep the Feet of His saints...for by strength shall no 
  man prevail. </i>(1 Samuel 2:1-10). So these great sons of Darkness are in violation 
  of the Scriptures at every turn. Not perceiving the Presence of God in all of 
  these events they are falling into the historical trap that God has set for 
  them</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But you already understand this. Anyone who claims to be a 
  child of God, no matter who he or she is, or what their station in life, becomes 
  subject to the precepts of that faith. That is, they become subject to the reality 
  of Divine Law as it is unfolding in both the pages of Sacred Writ and the press 
  of natural human events. And having laid their hands upon the written oracle 
  of God, they are enjoined by these same words to obey it. In it is the precept: 
  <i>God will not hold him guiltless who professes the Name of the Lord in vain. 
  </i>These are no idle words, but ominous. <i>Any man who saith I know him, and 
  keepeth not his commandments, is a liar and the truth is not in him. </i>Regardless 
  of all the lofty words one employs to convince men otherwise, and regardless 
  of the terrible events God is creating everywhere around us, that person is 
  a liar. <i>For he that saith he abideth in him ought also to walk, even as he 
  walked. </i>(1 John 2:3-6). Would Jesus assent to the doctrines of Ba'al, even 
  those so artfully expressed by Cal Thomas? And in addition to all this warmaking 
  and killing in Jesus' name (these retaliations), what, we may ask, is the president 
  doing sitting on a high throne in this world, one that his own professed master 
  refused to sit on? (Matthew 4:8-10). These are serious questions for which the 
  christian leaders of America will now be held accountable. (James, chapter 4 
  and 5).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But we must also bring ourselves into account. God's children 
  must also come together with a single mind. Why are we confused about this war? 
  some wars? all wars? war in general? Is there such a thing as a just war from 
  a spiritual point of view? Of course not. Has there ever been? Of course not. 
  God has never changed. Christianity's <i>Just War </i>theory is not a precept 
  of Christ, but rather the result of Augustine's (and others) twisted and worldly 
  imagination. But we fail to understand it or explain it in visible terms because 
  we have forsaken half of God's revelation of Him and Herself to the world. In 
  our struggle against war we have ruled out of our higher consciousness the fact 
  that God is a <i>Man of War</i>, <i>Yes, that is His Name</i>. (Exodus 15:3). 
  Some, using the language of the scriptures, blindly say that it is Satan who 
  inspires war. But this is only true in a secondary or indirect way. Satan (the 
  great Serpent), is that spirit in each of us individually, and in all of us 
  collectively, that keeps us from seeing it is God who incites war in the earth. 
  This spirit was vanquished for a time as Moses led Israel to the Foot of the 
  Mountain to behold the countenance of God. (Exodus 19). But Israel soon fell 
  back into the warring darkness, as Paul wrote: <i>As examples to us against 
  the last day</i> (1 Corinthians 10:1-11, KJV), and as it was also written: <i>If 
  that light in thee be darkness, then how great the darkness</i>. How great is 
  the church's complicity in the affairs of the American empire, for it is now 
  fallen almost completely away from Truth, and her children are literally being 
  led out to engage the very Lord it professes in those very battles that the 
  scriptures themselves say that God would bring to pass at the end of the age. 
  (Micah 3:5). And the cycle of war continues because men will not lay down their 
  arms and trust God to do likewise. The Gospel does not alter this reality but 
  amplifies it. Happily it also heralds an end to this cycle, as well as a great 
  paradox of history: <i>Follow peace with ALL men</i>, it says, <i>without which 
  no man shall see the Lord.</i> (Hebrews 12:14). And this is the paradox: The 
  fierce and terrible God of War (YHVH of the Torah, the Allah of Islam and the 
  <i>Pantokrator</i> over Russia, and the glorious Indra), will reveal Himself 
  to none but children of perfect peace:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Lord shall keep the Feet of His saints, and the wicked 
    shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; 
    out of heaven shall He thunder upon them: the Lord shall judge the ends of 
    the earth; and He shall give strength unto His king, and exalt the horn of 
    His anointed...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Samuel 2:9,10).</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">__________</p>

    God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements

    be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, blameless...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Peter 3:11-14).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This is the reason God has hidden Himself from the eyes of 
  the rulers of the world, and particularly from the children of Cain since the 
  very beginning (those whom Cal Thomas so laboriously praises), so that history 
  could come to pass exactly as it has, and so that God could reveal Himself once 
  again upon the plain of human events. Let's lift up our eyes and see God everywhere. 
  It's quite easy. What humanity is doing collectively God is doing singularly. 
  Be afraid. And then, of course, let the perfect love that God is creating in 
  us cast out this fear. But so much retribution upon those who are still found 
  searching the Scriptures for permission to violate these inner precepts of the 
  Mystery of Christ--especially for permission to wage war and kill other human 
  beings in the name of God, no matter what the cause, and especially in these 
  last days--for they shall find it. God has given the children of Darkness permission 
  to fulfill their heart's desire. He has placed it there, right squarely in the 
  &quot;letter&quot; of the written word (as well as in all the &quot;literal&quot; 
  implications of the Holy Qur'an):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Because they have not executed my judgments, but had despised 
    my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths </font></i><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
    meanings of my Law)</font><font size="+1"><i>, and their eyes were after their 
    fathers' idols.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, 
    and judgments whereby they should not live;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused 
    to pass through the fire </font></i><font size="3">(of war)</font><i><font size="+1"> 
    all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that 
    they might know that I am the Lord...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ezekiel 20:24-26).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus Paul spared no emphasis in admonishing us: <i>The Letter 
  killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</i> (2 Corinth.3:6; Romans 8:4-9). This 
  means that the written law, unrightly divided and incorrectly understood--for 
  it is an oracle in the ancient tradition--will lead one to destruction and death; 
  while the underlying meanings of the written word, which the Holy Spirit reveals, 
  lead to peace and life. <i>They are all plain to them that have understanding, 
  and right to them that find knowledge.</i> (Prov.8:9). These meanings are complex, 
  but once we have access to them they are not complicated. Just as every single 
  soul is a mixture of dark elements and light (which is why it was said: <i>Let 
  them grow together</i>), so the Holy Scriptures are a mixture of two traditions: 
  a written and an oral, which finally must be rightly divided one from the other...</font></p>

    things native to their own nature), the interpretation, as it were, in the

    only simple narratives and ordinary words. Were this really the case, then

    a sublime mystery...The narratives of the law are but the raiment in which 
    it (the higher law) is clothed. Woe to him who mistakes the garment for the

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And we discover that the one tradition is a reflection of the 
  other, and that the Law of God is alive. It is a Living Oracle. It has a body, 
  or an outer shell which is 'the letter.&quot; But this, as the body itself, 
  must perish as the soul puts on the garments of the inner life. As it enters 
  the spiritual realm the soul finds that Holy Writ is not a relic of some past 
  age but alive in parable, metaphor and allegory, and in the hidden epic sense 
  of things that underlie the outer sense of things. One looks around and discovers 
  that the kingdom of God does indeed fill the whole earth, and that wicked men 
  are indeed trying to storm it by force. But try as they might it is a fruitless 
  exercise because the Door to it is not where they imagine it to be. (And certainly 
  not in Palestine as the world can readily witness). Is it not made of Olive 
  Wood? (1 Kings 6:31). This means that none can gain access to the meanings of 
  the Oracle, or to the kingdom of God revealed in it, but children of perfect 
  peace.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The spiritual soul also discovers the root of this confusion. 
  It discovers that it is indeed called to be a warrior, and that it <i>is</i> 
  enjoined by Scripture to make war in the earth. Not against the mortal life 
  of other human beings, however, but against the empire of its own darkened nature. 
  This is the meaning of the allegory of holy warfare. The theme is recurrent 
  throughout the whole of ancient mythology, and throughout the Bible, from the 
  time that Adam's lower nature (Cain) rose up to slay his higher nature (Abel) 
  to this very present day. It is the import of Paul's words: <i>For the weapons 
  of our warfare are not carnal</i>--they are not swords that slay flesh, or guns, 
  or tanks and planes, nor may they ever be--but the <i>Sword of the Spirit, the 
  Word of God</i>. (2 Corinth.10:1-6; Ephesians 6:10-17). But the children of 
  Israel are sheep without shepherds (not all of them of course; the good shepherds 
  are still leading their flocks by <i>still waters</i>), and along with the children 
  of Darkness we see them all stumbling over the literal word. East and West they 
  stumble; Christian, Jew and Muslim, all stumbling over the same Rock. And we 
  discover, just as God has warned, that He is preparing to dash them all together 
  like empty vessels, the great and small alike. The clash has already begun. 
  Nevertheless, God is restraining Himself. This is why you are for the troops 
  and against the war. In the process of history, indeed, in the events of our 
  very own generation, our minds and the Mind of Christ have touched, and we have 
  fallen in love...with Life itself. And we have learned (even if we will not 
  yet admit it) to fear God, the Father of all spirits. (Judges 7:15-22; Psalm 
  2:9; Romans 9:17-33). But the great men of this age have neither love for God 
  nor fear. You are for the troops because they are being led to the slaughter 
  as sheep without a shepherd.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">God has been drawing the mind of Christ-in-us toward Themselves 
  since the time of Adam--the entire process taking shape over a course of time 
  equal to man's ability to perceive and understand it--but also chasing it across 
  these same pages of history in order to bring each of us to a certain balanced 
  state of perfection in these last days. (Ephesians 4). The ways of peace before 
  us, and behind us the fires of war. <i>A Cloud before them </i>(Heb.12)<i>, 
  and a Pillar of Fire behind, to shew them the way they must go</i>. (Exodus 
  13:21,22; Deut.1:33; 1 Cor.10:1-12). Is it not written of War itself: <i>Our 
  God is a Consuming Fire</i>. (Deut.4:24; Heb.12:29).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> (Please look into the world, consider the nations of the earth, 
  and particularly those powerful nations who are in social, political, economic 
  and military conflict with America. The sight and the thought of it is awesome 
  to behold. <i>Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the 
  stars, how high they are? </i>(Job 22:12). <i>It is He who founded His troop 
  IN the earth.</i> (Amos 9:6). How else could God end the age, or recall all 
  the elements of Darkness which He set in the earth for our instruction, but 
  by drawing them up against Himself--or rather, against each other? It is all 
  the same. And will not God judge and purify all the children of Adam in the 
  process? By shaking once and for all this proud and erring spirit of literalism 
  out of us? Our own thoughts shall judge us. They will either accuse or excuse 
  us in the day that the mysteries of God are revealed again. (Romans 2:1-16). 
  For our own thoughts will find us following one or the other: the Spirit of 
  Life and peace, or the spirit of death and destruction. And except for children 
  and the simple-minded there shall be no middle ground. So let's all excuse ourselves, 
  not only from our past transgressions--seeing how each of us had to come the 
  way we came in order to get to where we are--but from these great unfolding 
  affairs of God as well. <i>Stand back and see the salvation of the Lord</i>, 
  and call others, family and friends, and everyone else, to come out from among 
  them as well. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Who is the accuser? It is the spirit of antichrist. Will it 
  not be revealed in the day of the Lord? It is not hard to see it. It has taken 
  the high ground. It has become great and powerful in the earth, and in the name 
  of God it opposes God. In the name of Christ it overturns and violates the sacred 
  precepts of Christ. And what shall it do in the end thereof? (Deut. 31 and 32).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cal Thomas says: &quot;The peace movement pretends that negotiation, 
  not confrontation, will produce the better world they seek. But that presumes 
  each side has equally good intentions. What to do when one side is good (or 
  at least not evil) </font>(he means America)<font size="+1">, and the other 
  side is evil incarnate they never say.&quot; </font>(And of course, without 
  realizing it, by the &quot;other side&quot; he means God...Romans 13).<font size="+1"> 
  And then he says: &quot;Among the many problems of the peace movement is its 
  lack of ideas. It is an arid philosophy, devoid of content.&quot; So he forces 
  us to take refuge in the word of God:</font></p>

  is an ultimate crime against the individual conscience of these young men, forcing 
  them to choose between prison and their most innate understanding of their relationship 
  to God and the teachings of Christ. (Christians, as well as all others of course, 
  are absolutely forbidden by the Spirit to participate in the act of human warfare, 
  or in the violent shedding of human blood; and for that matter, neither are 
  they allowed to offer themselves for alternative service to any nation in a 
  time of war. The effect is the same). But in the absence of any clearly defined 
  interpretation of these matters, and left for the most part to their own individual 
  devices, with no visible communal or organized base, or means of legal support, 
  and hesitating to be (what would seem to them) the only ones to be stepping 
  forward at this time, they decided to sign. They have no intention, of course, 
  of submitting themselves for induction into the armed services if they should 
  ever be called, but have decided to wait, and take their stand along with the 
  hundreds of thousands of others who will stand up against <i>the Beast</i> at 
  that time. This is a very meaningful decision, and will prove to be a most timely 
  one in the end. Nevertheless, it also sheds a light on the immediate shortcomings 
  of the Antiwar Community in America. Where, or what is it all leading to? What 
  happens after the war?....More of the same? Are the same people, and the same 
  institutions left in charge of the world. Is the same old paradigm in place? 
  the same philosophies and antagonisms? Is this it?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Those who are its chief voices, and its most ardent organizers, 
  also possess a deep-seated reluctance to express the movement's aims in spiritual 
  and prophetic terms, and therefore have no vivid expectations, or idea what 
  a true spiritual revolution looks like, or where it could, or should lead. Of 
  course we understand: no one is trying to be in charge of anything, and this 
  is as it should be. Nevertheless, everyone knows that the present conflict in 
  the world has everything to do with the present State of Israel, and beyond 
  that with the very universal concept of Zion itself, and have not taken an active 
  account of the cosmic, messianic ideas that are both attending this conflict 
  and leading to its solution. But in truth, how could anyone do otherwise? the 
  books were sealed. The present abrogation of the Law and the prophets, however, 
  causes us to continue to express the movement's aims in terms of the present 
  collapsing paradigm, and leaves us appealing to <i>selective </i>provisions 
  of the American Bill of Rights and the Constitution on the one hand, and to 
  the rhetoric of Marxism on the other--with only random verses from the Bible 
  and the Qur'an included for good measure. The emerging synthesis (the Christ-conscious 
  paradigm) makes use of this history, and then transcends it. It accomplishes 
  at last what all else that has gone before it has failed to accomplish. For 
  just as three-dimensional consciousness is a thing of the past, so all political 
  and religious systems rooted in the material order must fail. (The dinosaurs 
  are gone, the Titanic sank, the Towers fell, and so will this age collapse...<i>and 
  great shall be the fall of it...</i>Matthew 7:22-27).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Unmindful of the spiritual shift that is really taking place 
  in the earth, or of the events that are rapidly unfolding, the present leading 
  voices of change in America have not approached the real field of battle and 
  are leaving the high ground as it were to the politicians and the prophets of 
  Ba'al--to those who are making use of the language of religion to advance their 
  own national and global ambitions. (We are not asking for these voices of change 
  to step down or disappear. Heaven knows they are standing in the breach, and 
  are courageously filling the space that the &quot;church&quot; itself has abandoned. 
  We just want them to learn the language, and perchance to become receptive to 
  the spiritual realities that are unfolding in the world). Jimmy Carter, the 
  spiritual voice of the Western/American globalist order, speaks peace, but he 
  does not mean it in the extreme. (He is actually the one to watch). Clinton, 
  of course, was not a believer either. He tried to work the system (the whole 
  American order of things and the military-industrial complex that maintains 
  it) from the Left--and then from the Center, and then...well he just gave in, 
  and became one of them. Imagining, along with the liberal wing of the American 
  church, and with various other factions on the Left, that he could actually 
  change the system in some essentially 60s kind of way, he wound up a friend 
  of neither. He wound up as irrelevant to the things that are unfolding in the 
  earth as the Left will be if it does not shift its attention from the purely 
  political realm to the spiritual. George W. Bush, on the other hand, has no 
  pretense toward the Left whatsoever, and is marshaling his forces against the 
  Day of the Lord--against the day of battle and war. As one pays very close attention 
  to the rhetoric and the slogans, and all the cyber-jargon that are issuing forth 
  from the White House and the Pentagon in our time, it is very plain to see that 
  not only are repressive measures being put in place, but that they are all readying 
  themselves for a war against Heaven itself. Learn the language, believe the 
  Word</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON__ As the Democratic 
    candidates for president attend religious services for the holidays, their 
    celebrations may be tempered by an uncomfortable fact : churchgoing Americans 
    tend to vote Republican. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An overwhelming majority of Americans 
    consider themselves to be religious. Yet according to the Pew Research Center 
    for the People and the Press, people who attend church more than once a week 
    vote Republican by 63 to 37 percent; people who seldom or never attend vote 
    Democrat by 62 to 38 percent. This disparity should concern Democrats--IF 
    NOT AS A MATTER OF FAITH THEN AS A MATTER OF POLITICS. More important, it 
    should concern anyone who cares about the role of religion in public life. 
    By failing to engage the republicans in this debate, the Democrats impoverish 
    us all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Bush and the Republicans 
    clearly have an advantage with people of faith as the election year approaches. 
    Republicans are more comfortable talking about religious values and issues, 
    and they are quick to promise that their faith will affect their policies 
    (even if, like their Democratic counterparts, they don't always follow through 
    on their campaign promises). President Bush is as public and expressive about 
    his faith as any recent occupant of the White House...The Democratic candidates, 
    in contrast, seem uncomfortable with the subject of religion...They stumble 
    over themselves to assure voters THAT WHILE THEY MAY BE PEOPLE OF FAITH</font><b> 
    </b>(What faith?)<b>, </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THEY WON'T 
    ALLOW THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS TO AFFECT THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS.</font><b> </b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For too many Democrats, faith is 
    private and has no implications for political life. But what kind of faith 
    is that? Where would America be if the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had kept 
    his faith to himself?</font><b> </b>(There is a thicket of faulty reasoning 
    here...African Americans in high political office, entrenched in capitalist 
    circles...in military uniform. Willis sees no deep spiritual problem here)<b>. 
    </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Howard Dean, the leading challenger 
    to President Bush, illustrates the Democrats' problem. Dr. Dean recently said 
    he left his church in Vermont over a dispute about a bike path, AND EXPLAINED 
    THAT HIS FAITH DOES NOT INFORM HIS POLITICS.</font><b> </b>(Jimmy Carter recently 
    said basically the same thing)<b>. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
    also said that the presidential race should stay away from the issues of 'guns, 
    God and gays,' and focus on jobs, health care and foreign policy. By framing 
    the issue in this way--declining to discuss overtly 'religious' topics--Dr. 
    Dean allows Republicans to define the terms of the debate. The 'religious 
    issues' in this election will be reduced to the Ten Commandments in public 
    courthouses, marriage amendments, prayer in schools and, of course, abortion. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These issues are important. But 
    faith informs policy in other areas as well. What about the biblical imperatives 
    for social justice, the God who lifts up the poor, the Jesus who said, 'blessed 
    are the peacemakers'?</font><b> </b>(Indeed, Isaiah 59...KJV)<b>. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How 
    a candidate deals with poverty is a religious issue</font><b> </b>(Indeed 
    it is, 1 Samuel 2:1-10; James, chapter 5)<b>,</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    and the Bush administration's failure to support poor working families should 
    be named as a religious failure.</font><b> </b>(Let's see now...from George 
    Washington to George W. Bush...Is there any hope in sight, short of the manifestation 
    of God's truly Anointed ones)?<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neglect 
    of the environment is a religious issue. </font>(What does it say? Revelation 
    11:18)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Fighting pre-emptive and 
    unilateral wars based on false claims is a religious issue (a fact not changed 
    by the capture of Saddam Hussein).</font><b> </b>(What does it say? How could 
    Bush resist? He is a vessel of perfect Darkness in the hands of God, as is 
    Saddam Hussein...Joel 3:9-14)<b>. </b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such issues could pose problems 
    for the Bush administration among religious and nonreligious people alike--if 
    someone were to define them in moral terms. The failure of the Democrats to 
    do so is not just a political miscalculation. It shows they do not appreciate 
    the contributions of religion to American life...</font></p>

    all Americans should have economic security, health care and educational opportunity, 
    and that true faith results in a compassionate concern for those on the margins.</font></p>

    the private sphere--just as the Republicans are wrong to define it solely 
    in terms of individual moral choices and sexual ethics. Allowing the Right 
    to decide what is a religious issue would be both moral and political tragedy. 
    Not everyone in America has the same religious values, of course. And many 
    moral lessons are open to interpretation. But by withdrawing into secularism, 
    the democrats deprive Americans of an important debate. </font>The New York
