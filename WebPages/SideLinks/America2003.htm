<div align="center"><b>America - The Real Danger Lies Within<br>

  PALM BEACH -- The year 2003 dramatically and dolefully illustrated Lord Acton's 
  famous dictum that absolute power corrupts absolutely. <b>An almighty United 
  States, unrestrained by any rival, international body, or world opinion, bestrode 
  the globe, a belligerent colossus determined to monopolize global oil reserves 
  and use its vast military power to crush lesser nations or malefactors that 
  disturbed the Pax Americana</b>.</p>
<p> <b>For America's hard right - a curious farrago of Armageddon-seeking southern 
  Protestants; neo-conservative supporters of Israel's right-wing Likud party; 
  and the military-industrial-petroleum complex - the Bush administration's aggressive 
  foreign policy of world domination, and utter contempt for international laws 
  and old allies, marks a new era of national greatness. President George Bush, 
  who vowed his foreign policy would be &quot;humble&quot; and &quot;compassionate,&quot; 
  has turned out to be the most radical president in modern U.S. history.</b></p>
<p>But for those Americans whose primary loyalty was to their country, rather 
  than to religious cultism, foreign nations, or financial profit, the rapid emergence 
  of the U. S. as an imperial power waging two hugely expensive colonial wars 
  in Asia was a disaster, both for America's democratic system and for the rest 
  of the world. Bush's vow to bring &quot;democracy&quot; to the Mideast rang 
  as hollow as pious assurances by 19th century European colonialists they were 
  gobbling up Africa and Asia to bring the blessings of Christianity and civilization 
  to benighted savages. Pillaging resources, not enlightenment, were - and remain 
  - the true colonial motivation. </p>
<p><b>Bush's claims to hold the mandate of heaven to wage global warfare against 
  the nebulous forces of &quot;terrorism&quot; sounded as dangerous and nonsensical 
  as old Chairman Leonid Brezhnev's drunken claims it was the Soviet Union's &quot;sacred 
  internationalist duty&quot; to launch military adventures anywhere on Earth 
  where socialism was threatened. </b></p>
<p><b>Columnist Georgie Anne Gayer put it perfectly when she recently wrote that 
  whereas America used to lead the world as champion of democracy, personal freedom 
  and human rights, today, under Bush, it instead seeks to dominate the world 
  through raw military and monetary power. <br>
  </b></p>
<p>In 2003, we saw an abject, cowardly Congress violate its duty as the republic's 
  premier political organ by disgracefully handing the barely elected president 
  carte blanche to wage an unprovoked war against Iraq that was justified by a 
  torrent of ludicrous lies worthy of Dr. Goebbels. Lies and propaganda that were 
  packaged in the best tradition of Soviet agitprop as news, then force-fed by 
  a servile media to an ill-informed public shockingly deficient in any sense 
  of history, geography, or foreign affairs. The invasions of Afghanistan and 
  Iraq, and sundry military adventures around the globe, were made possible by 
  a steady drumbeat of warnings from the White House and its neo-con trumpets 
  that the U.S. was in dire national peril from &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;rogue 
  states.&quot; Paranoia again swept America during the holiday season as planes 
  were grounded and orange alerts flashed at a populace that responded to these 
  synthetic alarms with well-trained Pavlovian reflexes. </p>
<p><b>Though the mighty United States, with only 5% of world population, accounts 
  for nearly 50% of total global military spending, the continuing Orwellian message 
  from Washington was of fear and vulnerability</b>. Vague threats of terrorist 
  attack and menacing Muslims were used to curtail American civil liberties, and 
  expand the government's powers of repression and intrusion.<b> The public barely 
  noticed this sinister, proto-totalitarian campaign</b>. </p>
<p>The so-called &quot;war on terrorism&quot; was a hoax used to mask and justify 
  the long-planned expansion of U.S. military power around the globe. What were 
  in reality a series of police actions waged against tiny anti-American groups 
  was no more a war than the farcical &quot;war on drugs.&quot; But invoking war 
  trumped criticism and dissent - and justified a real war of aggression against 
  oil-rich Iraq. The very term &quot;terrorism&quot; is a nonsense designed for 
  propaganda effect; a damning label applied by the administration to groups or 
  states strongly opposing U.S. policy. A &quot;war on terrorism&quot; makes no 
  more sense than waging war on evil. </p>
<p>Those who opposed Washington's surging imperial and totalitarian impulses were 
  branded &quot;leftists&quot; and &quot;anti-Americans.&quot; The French thinker 
  Regis Debray, writing about past colonial powers, answers thus: &quot;The free 
  man is not anti-American, but anti-imperial. America (now) revisits the time 
  of colonizers drunk on their superiority, convinced of their liberating mission, 
  and counting on reimbursing themselves directly.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>Criticizing U.S. foreign policy run-amok and George Bush does not equal anti-Americanism. 
  It is the citizen's birthright, and the friend's duty. This writer has witnessed 
  nine colonial wars and saw how they corrupted the armies, and then the nations, 
  that waged them, brutalizing conquered and conqueror alike. Iraq is the latest. 
  <b>Mankind's three worst scourges are religious fanaticism, nationalism and 
  imperialism. Each of these three evils has been whipped up by the Bush administration 
  to justify domination abroad, repression of dissidence at home and, of course, 
  re-election</b>. </p>
<p>Those who truly love and respect the United States, like this writer, a conservative 
  and U.S. Army veteran, see the very qualities that made America a beacon to 
  the world - its very soul - now under heavy assault by a cabal of religious 
  fanatics, foreign-leaning ideological extremists, and self-enriching Enron-Republicans. 
  That is a danger considerably greater than al-Qaida. <br>
