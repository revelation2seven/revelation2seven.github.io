  <p align="left"><font size="+1">It is the issue of abortion that stands in the 
    way, that keeps the &quot;progressive&quot; element of femalekind from nearing 
    perfection, from partaking in the fullest way of those things that are are 
    unfolding in the Earth at this time in history (in the womb of Mother Earth). 
    The issue of abortion is the <i>achilles heel</i> of the woman's movement, 
    it brings it down. The defense of abortion robs the Women's Movement of its 
    integrity in all other matters, its concerns for justice, and its (sometimes) 
    opposition to the manly arts of killing and warfare. The subject, nevertheless, 
    and the conflicts that have risen out of it, are as timely as the very words 
    of the prophets (and prophetesses) themselves:</font></p>

      women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered 
      ere the midwives come unto them...</font></i><font size="+1">(Exodus 1:19).</font></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, 
      a voice of the Lord that rendereth recommpense to his enemies.</font></i></p>

      pain came she was delivered of a man child </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(pay 
      attention and understand the meaning...it does not say a &quot;male child&quot;)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? 
      Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be 
      born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah

  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Perhaps it is a natural overreaction to centuries 
    of male domination, perhaps it springs from the same preoccupation with power 
    as dominant males suffer, but it has all resulted in the deep confusion such 
    women suffer in our time, between the <i>right to choose</i> and the <i>choices 
    they make</i>. To choose death over life is to throw oneself directly into 
    the same camp as the Conservative Religious Right (those who seem in their 
    own imaginations to be against abortion, yet not against capital punishment 
    or the taking of human life in the commission of human warfare), as Zionists 
    and the Neocons, as militarists and Western capitalists and every other destroyer 
    of the sacred environment into which this Child of Revelation is laboring 
    to be born. </font></p>

  <p><b>Abortions In Israel: More Than a Million Victims in 47 Years</b></p>
  <p><b>This column is dedicated to one of the most shocking, yet relatively undiscussed 
    subjects - abortions in the State of Israel. There is an organization called 
    &quot;Efrat&quot; whose primary goal is to increase the number of births of 
    Jewish children in Israel. This group, which works with wonderful &quot;msirus 
    nefesh&quot; [self-dedication] in fighting the astronomical number of abortions 
    in Israel, asked us to write about this subject for Parshat Shmot. Considering 
    the critical nature of the matter, we are more than happy to fulfill this 
    request. The fact is that he who remains quiet concerning the issue of elective 
    abortions becomes a partner to this atrocious mass murder.</b></p>
  <p><b>As society increasingly depicts abortions as representing&quot;progress&quot; 
    and &quot;womens rights&quot;, the statistics regarding it have become more 
    and more staggering. According to &quot;Efrat&quot;, more than 1,000,000 children 
    have been killed since the beginning of the State. Yes, a genuine holocaust 
    - and no one cares. According to a recent study, 60% of women who gave birth 
    at Hadassah Hospital in Har HaZoftim admitted than they underwent an abortion 
    &quot;out of convenience&quot; in the past. When the former Minister of Health 
    Dr. Sadan took it upon himself to fight against this phenomenon, playing a 
    short film for the members of the Israeli Knesset depicting the abomination 
    of abortions in Israel, and comparing this legal mass murder to the Holocaust 
    in Europe, the Knesset members jumped out of their skin. What enraged them 
    so? The murder of the fetuses? Of course not! What shocked these bleeding 
    hearts was the fact that Mr. Sadan made the comparison of abortion to the 
    Holocaust. He was forced to step down and relinquish his duties.</b></p>
  <p><b>What is particularly fascinating, though, is the entire leftist, liberal 
    approach to the subject. From their point of view, the more one supports abortions, 
    the more &quot;enlightened&quot; that person is. You may ask: How does mass 
    murder sit so well with humanitarian enlightened types? It's quite simple! 
    You see, the killing of a fetus is an expression of &quot;freedom over one's 
    body&quot;, feminism, and progressive advanced society! And what about the 
    fetuses right to live? That is not relevant to the modern and progressive.</b></p>
  <p><b>While every decent person would agree that child abuse is abhorrent, suddenly 
    it becomes legitimate and even fashionable to kill a child in his mother's 
    womb. Technically speaking, harming a child one second after he leaves his 
    mother's womb is demented, but killing it a second before leaving his mother's 
    womb is &quot;freedom over her body&quot;. This gross perversion of morality 
    is the result of morals that are dictated by man and not God. Not long ago, 
    it was even reported that in certain gynecological clinics that perform abortions, 
    dogs eat the remains of the baby after it has been grated from his mother's 
    womb.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The Tiniest Human Being&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Story of a Doctor: &quot;Many years ago, after anesthetizing the woman 
    for the sake of halting the pregnancy from outside the womb (second month), 
    I held in my hand the tiniest human being ever seen. The fetus was impeccable 
    - complete and transparent. It was a male full of energy swimming in the sac 
    of water, adjoined by the umbilical cord to the wall of the sac. The miniature 
    human being was completely developed - long and narrow fingers, feet and toes. 
    Its skin was practically transparent. Its arteries and veins stood out until 
    the tips of his fingers. The body was completely alive and was in no way similar 
    to the pictures of fetuses that I had seen in the past. When the sac was opened, 
    his life was terminated instantaneously, and he looked just like one would 
    expect a fetus to look like at this stage - lifeless.&quot; (Dr. Paul N. Rockwell)</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;80 Cents Short&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Story of a Chief of Staff: &quot;I was born in Tel Adashim. The date was 
    under dispute, until my father and the head of the village determined: January 
    11, 1929. I left my mother's womb to breathe the world's air because my parents 
    were....too poor. Totally impovershed. Four children came before me, and my 
    father could not provide for them. That is why my parents decided to spare 
    <br>
    me from such poverty and put an end to me - in my mother's womb. But we were 
    so poor that that my father couldn't come up with the two liros necessary 
    to perform the abortion. Through great effort my father was able to collect 
    one liro and 20. He urged the doctors to do the abortion and he would pay 
    the 80 grushim at a later date - but the doctors refused. No credit allowed, 
    and a son was born. Now there were five children in the needy family. There 
    were days when my parents would say jokingly: &quot;This kid <br>
    is worth two liros?&quot; (Story of former Chief of Staff, Rafael Eitan).</b></p>

    forth her twentieth babe, as the Western world counts her progeny; for according 
    to the books, just nineteen of her centenarian brood have lived and died since 
    he appeared to whom all Christians look as the Teacher of the Way to God. 
    The common consciousness of the General Church flows not from the fact that 
    all believe he is the Teacher of the way, but from the faith, He is the Way 
    (the Tao) itself.</b></p>
  <p><b>Will the twentieth century witness the fulfillment of this so-great expectation; 
    can it be said of the present time that the whole creation travaileth together 
    waiting for the manifestation of the <i>sons</i> of God? Never more in the

    in things religious than it is today; never have the conditions been more 
    favorable for the wise holding of a wide view of the real nature of Christ 
    and the task he is working to achieve in the evolution of his world-faith. 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Perhaps it may not be so difficult as it appears at first sight, to point 
    to the direction in which the answers to these questions may be to some extent 
    anticipated. That similar phenomena recur in the natural world is the unvarying 
    experience of mankind; that time is the ever-moving image of eternity, and 
    that the Wheel of Genesis is ever turning, is testified to by wiser minds 
    of humanity. Whither, then, should we look in the history of human affairs 
    for phenomena similar to the happenings of these last three hundred years? 
    Whither else more certain than to the history of the times that witnessed 
    the birth of the religion of Christ? The many striking parallels between the 
    social and religious aspects of civilization of that critical epoch and our 
    own times have been sketched by several writers, but no general notice has 
    been given to their endeavors, least of all has any practical lessons been 
    learned from the experience of humanity. </b></p>
  <p><b>The soul of man returns again and again to learn the lessons of life in

    21:20-23)</font><b>. It may well be that even many identical souls who were 
    embodied in the early centuries of Christianity are continuing their experience

    problems arise, the same way of looking at things? </b></p>
  <p><b>We must further remember that the records of that time are frequently

    cheering throng that the tide was turning in the long struggle to restrict 
    legal abortion, and that a new Republican majority in the Senate and a sympathetic

    Citing the movement's gains in the House and the Senate in last fall's elections,

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still the White House was trying 
    A CAREFULLY CALIBRATED APPROACH on this diverse issue. While he rallied the 
    marchers, Mr. Bush did so from St. Louis, where he was campaigning for his 
    economic plan (see James, chapter 5). At the same time time, his top political 
    adviser, Karl Rove, told reporters that the president was focusing on an agenda 
    that fell far short of the abortion ban he--and the movement--support. Asked 
    how long it might be before Mr. Bush started pushing for such a ban, Mr. Rove 
    replied: &quot;For now we're focusing on getting the partial birth abortion 
    ban and doing some thing about cloning. Let's get those victories before we 
    start making prognostications about what might be years in the future.&quot;

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critics assert that what they call

    a woman's health...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In what has become one of the enduring 
    rituals in Washington, each side made its case with graphic imagery: Many 
    abortion opponents carried pictures of aborted fetuses, in one case superimposed 
    on the American flag. Abortion rights supporters countered with the images 
    of women, including women who died of botched abortions performed when the 
    procedure was illegal.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE WAR OVER ABORTION</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Sheryl Gay Stolberg</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometime soon, most likely, President 
    Bush will sign into law a ban on a procedure its critics call partial-birth 
    abortion, becoming the first president to criminalize an abortion technique. 
    To partisans in the debate it will be a historic moment, the beginning of 
    the end of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. 
    &quot;Today is a monumental day for the sanctity of human life,&quot; Tony 
    Perkins, president of the Family research Council, declared after the Senate 
    last week voted on the bill.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other side of the fence, 
    Kate Michelman, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights 
    advocacy group, accused the bill's sponsors of plotting &quot;to take away 
    entirely the right to personal privacy and a women's right to choose.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You have a nation basically 
    divided over abortion, but only 12 percent who would outlaw it under all circumstances,&quot; 
    said Celinda Lake, a Democtratic pollster who tracks the issue. &quot;You 
    have the public moving on, saying this is a fight that both sides may enjoy, 
    but I certainly don't.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So while abortion is an ever-present 
    indercurrent in American politics, it is, for now, just that: an undercurrent. 
    Candidates in both parties steer clear of the issue when they can, and with 
    good reason...&quot;When this is enjoined by some federal court the day it 
    is signed, I bet Karl Rove will breath a sigh of relief,&quot; said Mr. Garrow, 
    referring to the president's senior political adviser. &quot;You make the 
    constituency happy by signing it into law, and then the big bad courts torpedo 
    it, and then nobody's talking about it.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abortion opponants recognize this, 
    and it infuriates them. The Republicans got a free vote,&quot; complains Judy 
    Brown, president of the American Life League, referring to the abortion ban. 
    &quot;From the beginning this was a Republican concept. It was the least they 
    could possibly get away with in order to receive the pro-life vote.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet it is clear that the controversey 
    over the ban has altered the tenor of the debate. The issue first came to 
    the fore in 1995, after abortion opponants discovered a medical paper describing 
    a procedure, performed at 20 weeks of pregnancy or beyond, in which the Trunk 
    of the fetus is delivered before the surgeon punctures the skull. &quot;It 
    was all in plain English,&quot; recalls Douglas Johnson, legislative director 
    for the National Right to LIfe Committee...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abortion rights advocates, well 
    aware they lost the public relations battle, are now trying to recover. Naral 
    Pro-Choice America is planning to air television advertisements when Mr. Bush 
    signs the ban. The ads do not mention the word &quot;abortion.&quot; Rather 
    the decry &quot;the first federal ban on safe medical procedures,&quot; ending 
    with the ominous question: &quot;Who knows what they will do next?&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are going to be very aggressive 
    in taking a case to the American public that this president has crossed the 
    line,&quot; said Ms. Michelman, the Naral Pro-Choice America president. In 
    fact, Ms. Michelman intends to resign her position to devote herself to putting 
    a Democrat in the White House. &quot;I don't think there is anything more 
    important,&quot; she said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abortion opponants are similarly 
    fired up. Already, they are planning their next legislative moves, including 
    a bill to help pregnancy centers buy sophisticated ultra-sound equipment, 
    on the theory that a window into the womb turns sentiments away from abortion...</font></p>

<p>Dear Friend, <br>
  The months ahead will be a pivotal time for our nation as we speak out for democracy 
  and against intolerance and discrimination. On April 25, over 1,000 women's 
  rights, civil rights, and health care organizations are leading an historic 
  &quot;March for Women's Lives&quot; in Washington, DC. Women -- not the government 
  -- should have the right to make the most deeply personal decisions about their 
  health and their lives. Government's role should be to ensure -- not deny -- 
  women's access to the full range of reproductive health services. Yet all these 
  rights are under unrelenting attack. </p>
<p>Visit http://www.marchforwomen.org to get more information, sign up for the 
  March, register your delegation, send a donation, alert your friends, or connect 
  with your local March coalition to help fill buses, trains and planes with determined 
  activists and united voices. Help us Make History! Join the hundreds of thousands 
  who will march to protect our right to birth control, emergency contraception, 
  abortion, and all reproductive health services as well as our right to have 
  children and plan our own families according to our own personal, religious 
  and moral beliefs not those of a tyrannical minority. We will never go back 
  to the days before Roe v. Wade when women died from illegal abortions or were 
  forcibly sterilized. The March is not just for girls and women who have the 
  option of choice, but also for those who live with the fears and devastation 
  of poverty, war, intolerance and sexual violence that threatens their very being 
  and for the men who care about us. Thank you for speaking out and taking action! 
</p>
<p>The March is being organized jointly by seven organizations: American Civil 
  Liberties Union, Black Women's Health Imperative, Feminist Majority Foundation, 
  NARAL Pro-Choice America, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, 
  National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. 
  More than 1000 organizations have signed on as co-sponsors. </p>
