<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CURRENT RELIGIOUS 
  THOUGHT</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have we an American 
  Religion?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many think civil religion 
  equates the status quo with God's Will.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sociologist Robert N. Bellah in 
    his lecture &quot;Civil Religion in America,&quot; given to the Daedalus Conference 
    on American religion in 1966, (published in <i>Daedalus</i>, Winter, 1967), 
    made the subject popular. Bellah provided not only the vocabulary, but also 
    the analytical tools with which to investigate civil religion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The term &quot;civil religion&quot; 
    has not been precisely defined. Laymen could not always know whether it is 
    being advocated or criticized...The term &quot;civil religion&quot; usually 
    means folk religion held by a provincially minded group. In the current discussion 
    it is limited to the American religious scene.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many people think that civil religion 
    equates the status quo and the good of the country with God's will. Such a 
    religion would amount to a patriotic assertion of the unqualified favor of 
    God toward your own political group.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No doubt there is reason to think 
    that this is a typical American attitude. Lecturers, clergymen, and even presidents, 
    have conveyed this impression. Quite possibly over-enthusiasm on public occasions 
    have produced these statements.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some critics decry any reference 
    to God in public utterances, and, even further, in any remarks complimentary 
    of the American nation. Others are suspicious of any use of group symbolism 
    to portray a sophisticated society...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sidney M. Mead observes that &quot;...the 
    being of a nation with a distinct identity implies a tacitly accepted creed 
    among its people.&quot; (<i>American Civil Religion,</i> Harper and Row). 
    If this is correct then the appeal to national symbols is not in itself evil. 
    The error creeps in when these symbols are divinized.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We must remember that the American 
    nation struggled for identity in a period following the fragmentation of European 
    religious life. It has no single integrating motif. Rather it had to deal 
    with such &quot;New Israel&quot; expressions as &quot;righteous Commonwealth,&quot; 
    &quot;Holy experiment,&quot; &quot;religious freedom,&quot; &quot;religious 
    pluralism,&quot; and &quot;manifest destiny.&quot;...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac4.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...A new perception of nationhood 
    emerged and brought order to these varied motifs. The founding fathers tried 
    to relate the Christian faith to the developing political order. And they 
    used such &quot;Enlightenment&quot; concepts as &quot;the Laws of Nature and 
    Nature's God,&quot; &quot;higher law,&quot; and &quot;inaliable rights&quot; 
    in so doing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this process religion and politics 
    overlapped, and this has never been obliterated. It is too much to expect 
    the average person to appreciate either the complexity of the problem or the 
    synthesis that has been achieved.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tragic times through which 
    our nation has passed, especially since 1917, have driven us to search for 
    a set of symbols by which to reclaim our identity and our self-worth. Has 
    this quest deified the American way of life? or &quot;the Nation under God?&quot;...</font>(The 
    resounding answer is Yes)!</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;PRESIDENT George Bush, whatever 
    other eminence awaits him, is already bound to be memorable as the American 
    leader most deeply attached to linked emblems of our national religion: the 
    flag and the fetus, our Cross and our Divine Child. The flag and the fetus 
    together symbolize the American Religion, the partly concealed but scarcely 
    repressed national faith. Defining religion is always difficult, particularly 
    since civil religion and its pragmatic consequences are radically different 
    when compared to historical and traditional creeds. Religion, in the ostensibly 
    Protestant United States, is something subtly other than Christianity, though 
    to say that we are a post-Christian country is misleading. Rather we are post-Protestant, 
    and we live a persuasive redefinition of Christianity. It is so persuasive 
    that we refuse to admit that we have revised the traditional religion into 
    a faith that better fits our national temperament, aspiration, and anxieties. 
    A blend of ancient heresies and nineteenth-century stresses, the American 
    Religion moves toward the twenty-first century with an unrestrained triumphalism, 
    easily convertible into our political vagaries...&quot; </font>The American 
    Religion by Harold Bloom, p.45.</p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The rulers wanted to deceive humanity. Inasmuch as they 
    saw that it had kinship with (what was) truly good, they took the names of 
    the good and gave them to the non-good, to deceive humanity by the names and 
    bind them to the non-good...for they wanted the free to be taken...</font></i><font size="+1">(Gospel

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About your recent editotial quotation 
    entitled &quot;Superpatriots.&quot; You quoted international socialist George 
    Bernard Shaw when he wrote: &quot;The 100 percent American is 99 percent idiot.&quot; 
    I take it that to some in the editorial department patriotism is somehow outdated...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patriotism is basically love of 
    country and what it stands for symbolized by the American flag...Because of 
    patriotism, in 1776 we fought and won freedom from British tyranny. Because 
    of patriotism, love of country, and what it stands for, we are free people 
    </font>(of course, this seems true as long as we define our freedoms in terms 
    of the unimpeded rights of producers and consumers)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    and enjoy freedoms envied by the rest of the world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If patriotism did not exist in 
    1776 what would have happened? We would have remained a people under British
