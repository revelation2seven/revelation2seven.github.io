  <b>Wendy Campbell is a film-maker from California, and a familiar face: her 
  powerful essays already appeared on this list and elsewhere. Today we offer 
  her provocative and biting description of her visit to the city where the main 
  street is called Yitzshak Rabin Boulevard. No, it is not Tel Aviv, but Miami. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>But first, an announcement: Wendy made a new documentary called &quot;NETUREI 
  KARTA: JEWS AGAINST ZIONISM&quot; and it will be screened on April 14 at 7:30 
  pm at La Pena Cultural Center at 1305 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley. Wendy describes 
  her film as an &quot;interview with the engaging Rabbi Weiss of the Ultra Orthodox 
  Jewish group called Neturei Karta (which means &quot;Guardians of the City&quot; 
  in the ancient Aramaic language), which was formed in the 1930's before Israel 
  was created in 1948, to protest the new movement called Zionism. Rabbi Weiss, 
  who is based just north of New York City, explains why his worldwide organization 
  believes that Zionism is the exact opposite of Judaism and why they pray for 
  the peaceful dismantling of the Zionist state of Israel.</b></p>
<p><b>Mainstream media has always ignored the activism of the Neturei Karta and 
  other anti-Zionism groups, so this film may be somewhat shocking, but very enlightening, 
  for many people who have always thought that all Jews are pro-Israel and Zionists. 
  Rabbi Weiss provides a fascinating and concise history of Judaism and how Zionism 
  has been aggressively seeking to transform it, revealing their intimidation 
  tactics and falsehoods. He explains how the only way that true peace can be 
  achieved is through achieving justice for the Palestinian people, by apologizing 
  for having oppressed them AND FOR STEALING THEIR LAND. He advocates making amends 
  with them by providing reparations and allowing them equal rights.</b></p>
<p><b>According to Rabbi Weiss, Zionism is blatant racism and against true Jewish 
  values. He asserts that Judaism is a religion, but Zionism has attempted to 
  replace religion with nationalism. For more information about Neturei Karta,

<p align="center"><b>Miami, Florida: Zionist Occupied Territory? <br>
  By Wendy Campbell</b></p>
<p> <b>Recently, my boyfriend and I decided to take a trip to South Beach Miami 
  along with a couple days down in Key West, just for fun. These days, as anti-war 
  and anti-Zionism activists, with a special interest in resolving the Israel-Palestine 
  conflict which is fueled by US tax dollars, we tend to see everything through 
  highly politicized lenses.</b></p>
<p><b> Of course, we both know that Florida has a large population of American 
  Jews, but we were surprised with the &quot;Zionization&quot; of Florida, as 
  well as the mention by people on two separate occasions in Key West, who didn't 
  even know about our politics, of Israeli money-laundering that is going on there. 
  Israel is the largest producer of the rave party drug Ecstasy, and apparently 
  the Israeli druglords also collude with South American drug dealers. The Israeli 
  drug dealers are said to launder money through their cheesy tourist trap tee-shirt 
  shops that line the lower end of Duval Street in Key West, the last island of 
  the Florida Keys. Since this activity seems to be common knowledge, maybe there 
  is some collusion with local authorities as well. <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>THE DEFINITION OF ZIONISM ...At any rate, please allow me to explain my 
  definition of &quot;Zionism&quot;. Zionism is a racist ideology that allows 
  for Jews from anywhere in the world to go to Israel-Palestine to claim superior 
  rights to the land and government there at the expense of the indigenous non-Jewish 
  Palestinians. It can be argued that Zionist Jews expect certain privileges above 
  and beyond the average citizen in any country they live. By the way, not all 
  Jews are Zionists, and not all American Jews think of Israel as their homeland. 
  Many American Jews, I'm sure, if not most, think of themselves as Americans 
  first and foremost. Many American Jews, I'm sure, accept their fellow Americans 
  as equals regardless of their religion, race, ethnicity or gender. However, 
  only Jews enjoy completely equal rights in Israel, where it is not a true secular 
  democracy even for Jews, in that only marriages between Jews are acknowledged 
  as legal in Israel, for just one example. Furthermore, all non-Jews are marginalized 
  in Israel.</b> </p>
<p><b>Zionist American Jews are the chauvinistic Jews who commonly believe in 
  innate, irreducible differences from others and their own cultural-religious 
  superiority to gentiles, or non-Jews. This attitude apparently enables them 
  to justify Israel's national campaign of blatant ethnic cleansing against the 
  non-Jewish Palestinians at worst as per &quot;hard Zionists&quot; or at the 
  very least, complete segregation as per the apartheid two-state solution favored 
  by &quot;soft Zionists&quot;. </b></p>
<p><b>American Zionist Jews tend to think of Israel as their homeland, and to 
  perceive America as the &quot;cash cow&quot; and military vessel for achieving 
  Zionist hegemony as well as convenient place to live where they can enjoy prosperity, 
  freedom and protection from the strife that occurs in Israel because of Zionism. 
  Zionists in America espouse universalistic, democratic principles for Americans 
  while trying to cover up Nazi-like campaigns in Israel against the Palestinians. 
  U.S. policies now reflect this abhorrent double standard in the so-called &quot;war 
  on terrorism&quot; in Iraq which is being waged on Israel's behalf. </b></p>
<p><b>Zionists also push and often succeed for Jewish supremacy in many areas 
  of American politics, media and culture to serve their narrow interests, often 
  at the expense of non-Jewish Americans. American Zionist Jews tend to place 
  their first loyalty to Israel, over and above any loyalty to America.We congratulate 
  American Jews who possess the moral clarity to denounce Zionism loudly and clearly, 
  and invite all others to do so as well.</b> <br>
</p>
<p><b>ZIONIZED MIAMI AND THE MEDIA...Back to the subject matter at hand. Is Miami, 
  Florida, Zionist-occupied territory? There were many things that we observed 
  that led us to believe it is. And we wonder, is the rest of America going to 
  follow suit? We hope not. For instance, most of the newspapers we looked at 
  seemed to be by, for and about Jews. The fact is that Miami is a highly diverse 
  and multi-cultural city, with a strong presence of Americans that come from 
  many backgrounds: Cuban, South American, European and African. As a side-note, 
  we met many Argentinians, who appear to be the latest new wave of immigrants. 
  Of course, we weren't sure who were actually American citizens, but obviously 
  many people in Miami are indeed American citizens. Why is it that such a culturally 
  diverse city seems to have media so dominated by those who are Jewish? This 
  could also be said about American media at large, however it is not always quite 
  so blatantly noticeable. In Israel, from what I understand, the liberal newspaper 
  the Ha'aretz employs no Gentile (non-Jewish) writers! In other words, in any 
  place that has been &quot;Zionized&quot;, the non-Jews tend to be dispossessed 
  and marginalized, and otherwise subjugated to various degrees. <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>JEWISH DISCRIMINATION AGAINST CHRISTIANS... Here is a very telling front-page 
  story of the Jan. 29 issue of the Miami newspaper the Sun Post. A woman by the 
  name of Sondra Snowdon has been on a hunger strike to protest the fact that 
  her town would not allow any Christmas decorations to be displayed other than 
  a Christmas tree yet many Jewish decorations for Hanukkah were allowed, such 
  as the menorah and the Star of David. She and another woman from another community 
  who has also been experiencing the same kind of discrimination against the display 
  of Christmas decorations are considering taking civil action. As per the article, 
  Councilman Robert Yaffe said the council should make a &quot;better effort to 
  embrace the celebrations of all members of the community.&quot; Now isn't that 
  a fact! </b></p>
<p><b>It seems obvious that Zionist Jews have a propensity for cultural competitiveness 
  and even discriminate against non-Jews, including Christians, and most obviously 
  Muslims. By the way, Hanukkah is a minor holiday in the Jewish religion, yet 
  it has been elevated by Zionist Jews in order to compete and even at times to 
  dominate over the most holy day for Christians, the holiday of Christmas, a 
  time that is now simply referred to &quot;The Holidays&quot;. </b></p>
<p><b>Zionist Jews relentlessly seek to promote programs to educate Americans 
  about their version of the Holocaust, which by the way, claimed many non-Jewish 
  victims including the ones who gave their lives to end the war although this 
  is not emphasized by Zionists. As they seek to bring Jewish culture to mainstream 
  America, Zionists often display insensitivity if not hostility towards others' 
  religions, including Christianity, as well as others' nationalities, in particular 
  for example, Germans, Austrians and all Arabs. Jewish Dominance On Street Signs... 
  </b></p>
<p><b>THE TABOO AGAINST CRITICIZING ISRAEL AND THE BEHAVIOR OF ZIONIST JEWS...This 
  all fits into the pattern of the strong taboo against speaking about Jews at 
  all in connection with anything negative, no matter how justified. Holocaust 
  lore has created a potent taboo against criticizing specifically Jewish political 
  actions. In today's &quot;post Holocaust&quot; environment, Jews are to be viewed 
  either in a uniformly positive light or as victims. This surely benefits Israel's 
  ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing against the non-Jews in Palestine-Israel, 
  not to mention their privileged status here. The fear of the smear of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; 
  is deliberately intended to diminish all legitimate protest against Zionism 
  and its crimes. Expect to see still more Holocaust Museums, Holocaust classes 
  in both public and private Christian schools, movies, cartoons, artifacts, etc. 
  coming soon to a neighborhood near you! <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>The repetition is essential in order to constantly attempt to justify Israel's 
  on-going ethnic cleansing campaign which now includes the building of the monumental 
  Apartheid Wall, which also illegally separates more Palestinians from their 
  land, another example of under-reporting of Israel's wrong-doings. The logic 
  that follows, is if the Jews are portrayed as always innocent of any wrongful 
  behavior, then the only reason one could be anti-Jew or more accurately, anti-Zionism, 
  is because of some irrational hatred, and never because of their lawless behavior. 
  However this attempt to protect Jews from &quot;scapegoating&quot; or more accurately 
  from holding Zionist Jews and Israel accountable for their behavior, is in fact 
  directly allowing Zionist Jews to continue breaking international law with impunity. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>THE NEED TO DEMAND EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL, EVERYWHERE, NOW...It is time for 
  all Americans of all races, religions and ethnicities, including non-Zionist 
  Jews, to stop being timid or blackmailed into allowing a separate political 
  or moral standard for Zionist Jews and the Jewish state of Israel. No topic 
  should be taboo, unless it is pure hate-mongering, something which anyone of 
  any religion is capable of, but which must be avoided. No one people's suffering 
  is any more important than any other people's suffering. &quot;Never again&quot; 
  coined by arch Zionist racist Meir Kahane, should mean never again should there 
  be a holocaust or any persecution of any people because of their race, religion, 
  ethnicity or gender, either here in America, or in Israel-Palestine or anywhere 
  in the world, especially any country that receives American tax dollars. There 
  must be no double standards allowed for anyone. All people and all countries 
  must abide by International Law, or else be held accountable for their crimes 
  against humanity in a recognized international court of law. It is time to address 
  the Palestine-Israel conflict in a completely truthful manner, and demand that 
  the Palestinians be allowed the same human rights as the Israelis. </b></p>
<p><b>Using the formula which dismantled apartheid in South Africa, similarly 
  Israel must be pressured by all people of conscience to transform into a true 
  secular democracy with equal rights for all regardless of religion, race, ethnicity 
  or gender. Firstly, a Truth and Reconciliation Committee must be set up, and 
  the suffering of the Palestinian people due to Zionism must be fully and truthfully 
  acknowledged by the world, and most especially by Israel. Then steps must be 
  taken to create a true secular democratic government that guarantees equal rights 
  for all to replace the current racist, Zionist government in Israel which favors 
  only Jews. Additionally, all Palestinians must be compensated for their losses, 
  including all the Palestinian refugees who must be allowed to claim their inalienable 
  right to return to Palestine-Israel. This is their right according to UN Resolutions, 
  International Law and world opinion. The U.S. and all the nations of the UN 
  should participate in accomplishing this. Once this is accomplished, and it 
  can be done if enough people demand it and work for it, then this will allow 
  a new era of peace and good will to emerge throughout the world, rather than 
  endless war.</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>THE STUMBLING BLOCK</b></p>

<p><br>
  <b>In the Return of the King, the Oscar-studded film based on the Tolkien's 
  fantasy, there is a touching and inspiring moment: at the lowest ebb of struggle, 
  when the Sauron hordes pour in through the breached gates of Gondor, horns announce 
  the arrival of the relieving force. Rohan is coming, and the looting Orks retreat 
  from the City in disarray.</b></p>
<p><b>Such a rescue force came to the embattled people of the Middle East in the 
  unexpected form of a film. This inspired creation of Mel Gibson broke THE DANGEROUS 
  AND IMMORAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN DEVOUT AMERICAN CHRISTIANS AND THEIR JEWISH </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(ZIONIST)</font><b> 
  SHEPHERDS. Mel Gibson and his Passion of Christ may well have advanced the cause 
  of justice and peace in Palestine more than we could possibly dream of. Incidentally, 
  he succeeded in undermining THE MOST DANGEROUS HERESY IN THE LONG HISTORY OF 
  CHRISTIANITY: THE RIGHT-WING EVANGELICAL'S INFATUATION WITH JEWS AND ZIONISM. 
  Now it is the time to recognise this victory and enjoy its fruits.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac4.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p><b>The Jewish establishment and its willing subjects carried out a perilous 
  policy of encouraging the Clash of Civilisations, embodied in ideological and 
  US military warfare against the Third World. For this reason, they promoted 
  the concept of a Judaeo-Christian, Civilisation at war with the Muslims, with 
  the Red-Brown, Russians, with the French and with traditional societies and 
  forces. Mel Gibson and his powerful film opened the Second Front of this great 
  struggle within the powerbase of the enemy -- in the US -- by exposing the lie 
  at the very foundation of the Judaeo-Christian myth.</b></p>
<p><b>AS ST. PAUL PROPHESIED, CHRIST TURNED OUT TO BE THE &quot;STUMBLING BLOCK&quot; 
  FOR THE JEWISH ADVANCE. The Jewish leaders thought they secured the US, and 
  that they could safely proceed with this war elsewhere. Their second target 
  was Islam, THE MIDDLE EAST THEIR BATTLEGROUND, and the trophy was to be the 
  holiest shrine of Islam in Jerusalem: the Dome of the Rock, with the blazing 
  golden letters inscribed by the Umayyad Caliphs that proclaim &quot;Blessed 
  is Jesus Christ, Blessed is the Day of His Nativity, and Blessed is the Day 
  of His Resurrection.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p><b>Zionists formed an alliance with the misled Christian Conservatives, and 
  the US troops took over Iraq and Afghanistan, while supporting the Israeli offensive 
  against the native Palestinians IN THE HOLY LAND. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Where 
  is the place of My rest...Isaiah 66:1)</font><b>. Then came Mel Gibson, and 
  their alliance fell apart. THUS, CHRIST INDEED WAS OUR SECRET WEAPON AGAINST 
  THE ZIONIST TAKEOVER. I felt it for long time; ever since on Easter 2001 I referred 
  to His Passion in context of Palestinian suffering, just to be immediately frozen 
  out by mainstream Jewish pro-peace groups. LET US RAISE THE BANNER OF CHRIST, 
  FOR IT CAUSES SPLIT AMONG OUR ADVERSARIES.</b></p>
<p><b>Professor Patrick McNally wrote that the Judeo-Nazis repeated the error 
  of German Nazis; they became over-extended by opening the Second Front. They 
  could not help: they attacked Gibson and the American Christians, though their 
  support was necessary for the Middle East takeover. </b></p>
<p><b>Sidney Blumenthal, an American Zionist Jew and a former senior adviser to 
  President Clinton, wrote in the Guardian: THE NEOCONS AND THE THEOCONS (conservative 
  Christians) were bound together for different reasons: the neocons by foreign 
  policy (read: support of Israel), the theocons by their continuing fundamentalist 
  revolt against modernity (for modernity read: neo-liberalism). Enter Mel Gibson, 
  sprinkling holy gasoline on the fires and blowing up the cultural contradictions 
  of American conservatism.,[1] It frightened Jews, concludes Blumenthal, and 
  therefore Bush must go.</b></p>
<p><b>In Israel, this understanding came first. Gershom Gorenberg wrote in the 
  Jerusalem Report[2]: &quot;Post-9/11, the &quot;conflict of civilizations&quot; 
  is often taken for granted; it supposedly pits the &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; 
  world against Muslims. That mood, along with the Intifada, has fertilized an 
  alliance twinning Israeli right-wingers and some U.S. Jewish leaders with conservative 
  Christians. THE PASSION SHOULD SOBER PEOPLE UP. </b><b>&quot;By attacking The 
  Passion, Jewish groups such as the Anti-Defamation League helped to publicize 
  it. I don,t think they had a better option. To ignore a film in which Pilate 
  is a softy and the Jews cry for Jesus, blood would be equivalent to pleading 
  &quot;no contest&quot; to the West's oldest calumny. But the Passion affair 
  underlines the absurdity of the romance between Jewish groups (including the 
  ADL) and the Christian Right.</b></p>
<p><b>Gershom Gorenberg is right. THIS ALLIANCE OF CHRIST-LOVING AMERICAN CONSERVATIVES 
  AND CHRIST-HATING JEWISH LEADERSHIP WAS ABSURD FROM THE BEGINNING. The Christians 
  in the US, as elsewhere, belong to the traditional all-embracing faith of love 
  to the poor and downtrodden. The Jewish establishment subscribes to the faith 
  which is good for the rich and powerful Chosen People, whether Jews or godless 
  Mammon worshippers. Their alliance was a peculiar quirk of history that brought 
  mankind to the edge of the abyss.</b></p>
<p><b>As a last, bizarre stroke of this alliance, on March 5th, 2004, the Arab-bashing 
  Pat Robertson appealed on his blasphemously-named Christian Broadcasting Network 
  (CBN), to the American Christians to join with Jews this year to celebrate the 
  Festival of Purim. Those who answer his call will celebrate together with hundreds 
  of followers and admirers of a fundamentalist American Jew, Baruch Goldstein, 
  who slaughtered dozens of worshippers in the city of Abraham, Hebron on Purim 
  in 1994. His burial place in Kiriyat Arba is the location for Purim celebrations 
  for many Israeli Jews, reported a Jerusalem weekly Kol HaIr on March 5, 2004. 
  It is probably the least-likely festival for a Christian to celebrate together 
  with Jews. By his call, Robertson plainly presented his anti-Christian credentials. 
  His enmity is not reserved for the Muslims only: Robertson also attacked Russia 
  and accused this Christian nation of plotting the &quot;gassing of Jews and 
  Jewish children&quot; which is a horrible blood libel against a country that 
  has a Jewish Prime Minister. But his support for Zionist atrocities in Palestine 
  would suffice for the viewers of Gibson's film to reject Robertson and his preaching 
  of hate.</b></p>
<p><b>God knows, there are other Christian forces, and the enthusiastic welcome 
  received by Gibson's film proves that they are the real majority. The Reverend 
  Charles Carlson of www.whtt.org runs Project Straight Gate, which speaks against 
  the war in Iraq and Palestine. On a recent pro-life demonstration they called 
  upon their fellow-Americans to care about lives of Iraqi and Palestinian children 
  as much as for the unborn children of America. Their signs read &quot;Innocent 
  Blood on Our Hands, Iraq - Gaza, and &quot;Choose Peace, not War. They called 
  upon &quot;fellow Christ-followers to oppose successive slaughter in the Middle 
  East. Americans are now among the victims of the war almost every day. But even 
  when none of 'ours' are killed, they are being fashioned into assassins and 
  brutal occupiers, which is not what most Christ-followers should desire for 
  their children.[3]</b></p>
<p><b>II <br>
  GIBSON'S FILM EXPRESSES FOREBODINGS OF THE SECOND COMING. It brings greater 
  awakening into Christian hearts in the Lent; IT RESTORES THE ALMOST-FORGOTTEN 
  TRADITION OF PASSION PLAYES; IT SEPARATES LAMBS FROM THE GOATS. Not only have 
  Abe Foxman of ADL and Mervin Hier of Wiesenthal Centre exposed their hostility 
  to Christ, but crypto-Zionist Michael Lerner of Tikkun sent his disciples to 
  give away anti-Christian leaflets at the movie theatres. Lerner began as a peace-seeker, 
  but soon turned out to be a Zionist Trojan horse in the peace camp.</b></p>
<p><b>On the other side, Mark Bruzonsky of MER, a longtime friend of Palestine, 
  condemned the Jewish establishment's attempt &quot;to relentlessly crucify Gibson 
  for trying to tell the story as he knows it, or rather as he believes it, [as] 
  in itself a kind of intellectual and political blasphemy. Rather Gibson should 
  be thanked for standing his ground, making his movie, telling his story, AND 
  MAKING ALL OF US PONDER AND THINK AND FEEL...WHETHER JEW, CHRISTIAN, MUSLIM, 
  BUDDHIST, ATHEIST...OR JUST PLAIN HUMAN. Our friend Gilad Atzmon published a 
  strong essay supporting Gibson, while brave Jeff Blankfort of California wrote 
  that it confirms the reality of Jewish control over Hollywood.</b></p>
<p><b>Indeed, this film unveiled the anti-Christian intentions of American Jewry. 
  The New York Times reported that the chairmen of major studios said they would 
  avoid working with Mr. Gibson because of The Passion of the Christ. One of them 
  explained: &quot;It doesn't matter what I say. It'll matter what I do. I will 
  do something. I won't hire him. I won't support anything he's part of.[4] Because 
  they run Hollywood it is not strange that America produces anti-Christian films 
  seeping with hatred for the poor, downtrodden, un-Chosen people, be it American 
  rednecks or Arabs, Russians or Latin Americans. The US newspapers, too, gave 
  vast coverage to the hostile positions of Jews on the subject of Passion, showing 
  an incredible bias well known to us friends of Palestine</b>.</p>
<p><b>Their fear and loathing shows that this film can change America; and therefore 
  it can change the world. American Christians can recognise the urgent need to 
  free their media from the deadly grip of Christ's enemies. They can attune their 
  policies towards Christ, share their worldly goods with the needy, return their 
  sons from overseas wars, turn their mighty arms industry into ploughshare makers 
  to feed the hungry; reject Mammon; promote spirituality and be a good neighbour 
  to all nations of the Earth.</b></p>
<p><b>Let them remember: the Passion of Christ is not a millennia-old event: even 
  today, as I write, IT IS THE FUNDS AND WEAPONS SENT BY THE US THAT ARE HELPING 
  THE JEWS TO CRUCIFY PALESTINE. They besiege the Nativity town of Bethlehem and 
  plot to destroy the Dome of the Rock with its benedictions of Christ. The horrors 
  of the Passion presented by Mel Gibson are inflicted daily on the captive Palestinians. 
  THEY ARE KILLED BY THE HUNDREDS, TORTURED BY THE THOUSANDS AND STARVED BY THE 
  MILLIONS. PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT OR IGNORE THIS PERSECUTION WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO 
  WASH THEIR HANDS OF THEIR BLOOD.</b></p>
<p><b>THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL SHOW WHETHER THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS 
  CARE FOR CHRIST; whether they are an independent political power at all, or 
  just an alibi-providing Gentile front for the Jewish policies; whether the only 
  political swing possible in the US is that between pro-Likud Bush and pro-Labour 
  Kerry. It is the time for Americans to regain their lost independence. BUT FOR 
  THAT, THEY WILL NEED A MIRACLE</b></p>
