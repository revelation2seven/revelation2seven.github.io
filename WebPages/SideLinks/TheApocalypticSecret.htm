  <div align="left"> 
    <p><b>A leading US TV news reporter has said her network is taking a risk 
      with a news special which asks whether Jesus Christ had a wife. ABC's Elizabeth 
      Vargas said Jesus, Mary and Da Vinci, to be shown in the US on Monday night, 
      was being made &quot;as respectfully as we can&quot;. But she admitted: 
      &quot;You can't talk about this subject without intriguing people or offending 
      people.&quot; The programme is partly based on the best-selling novel The 
      Da Vinci Code.</b></p>
    <p><b>The book alleges Mary Magdalene - a biblical figure widely thought to 
      have been a prostitute - was actually Jesus's wife. The book also asserts 
      Magdalene fled Jerusalem with Jesus' child after his crucifixion. This story 
      was supposed to have been kept alive by a secret society that included the 
      medieval painter and inventor Leonardo Da Vinci. Da Vinci left clues about 
      the story in his art, the novel alleged. ABC have already screened the special, 
      which talks to some theologians to try and unravel the theory, for some 
      journalists and religious leaders.</b></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><b>It has already drawn criticism from a representative of the Catholic 
      League, Joseph Feo, who said the news special had relied too much on the 
      opinions of Father Richard McBrien of Notre Dame. Father McBrien is said 
      to believe the historical importance of Mary Magdalene had been under-rated. 
      </b></p>
    <p><b>Mr De Feo said: &quot;The majority of the people who spoke believed 
      in either the plausibility or the outright truth of [book author] Dan Brown's 
      claims. The facts themselves scream out that this is a crackpot theory.&quot; 
      Vargas said ABC had not found any proof as to whether Jesus had a wife, 
      but could not completely discount the theory either. &quot;For me, it's 
      made religion more real and, ironically, much more interesting - which is 
      what we're hoping to do for our viewers,&quot; she said.</b></p>

  </font><b>A History of Mystification: </b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Part I - Rennes-le Chateau: Treasures, Kings and Heretics</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>One</b></p>
<p><b>In the last decade of the 19th century, a poor parish priest with pretensions 
  of medieval glory stumbled on one or more Visigothic tombs and used the proceeds 
  from his vandalism to repair the parish church and build himself a villa and 
  a Gothic tower. From these simple but somewhat nefarious beginnings would spring 
  one of the New Age's foremost cottage industries, collectively known as the 
  Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau.</b></p>
<p><b>Blasted into prominence by the best-selling Holy Blood/Holy Grail, by Baigent, 
  Lincoln and Leigh, Rennes-le-Chateau has also become a newage tourist destination. 
  On any afternoon during the season, several bus loads of mystery seekers can 
  be found filing through the church and the museum. They buy books at the bookstore 
  and have lunch at the Blue Apples Cafe, and then its back on the bus for Carcassone 
  or Montsegur. Most, if questioned, think that Rennes-le-Chateau is nice, even 
  if the church is somewhat morbid. They also think that the mystery has something 
  to do with THE TRUE TOMB OF JESUS and his descendants. Father Sauniere found 
  something and blackmailed the Catholic church with it; that's where he got his 
  money, echoes the general sentiment.</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

  RELIC<br>
  <br>
  By Maryann Bird</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Religious belief and modern skepticism 
    have been butting heads since the Enlightenment. Here's a case in, um, point: 
    Is the ancient spear in the Imperial Treasury at Vienna's Hofburg Palace really 
    the one that a Roman centurion used to pierce the side of the crucified Jesus 
    Christ? Legend insists that it is, but science is doing its best to fact-check 
    the story. Like the 51-cm relic itself &#151; first mentioned in the Gospel 
    of John &#151; the tale of the Holy Lance, or Spear of Destiny, has been embellished 
    over the ages. As one oft-quoted account has it: &quot;Whomsoever claims this 
    spear and solves its secrets holds the destiny of the world in his hands, 
    for good or evil.&quot; </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">British metallurgist 
    Robert Feather has decoded some of its secrets. He addressed old beliefs with 
    21st century X-ray diffraction and fluorescence tests to reveal structure 
    and composition, swab checks for organic material (like blood), and other 
    noninvasive procedures &#151; and found the main body of the spear to be medieval, 
    dating to the 7th century at the earliest. Charlemagne may well have possessed 
    the spear in 800 &#151; and Hitler's Nazis took it from Vienna in 1938 &#151; 
    but Constantine the Great could not have called upon the reputed powers of 
    a weapon that didn't exist to help him Christianize the Roman Empire in the 
    4th century. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the story (told 
    in a documentary, The Spear of Christ, which airs in the U.K. this week) does 
    not end there. An iron pin &#151; long claimed to be a nail from the crucifixion, 
    hammered into the blade and set off by tiny brass crosses &#151; is &quot;con-sistent&quot; 
    in length and shape with a 1st century Roman nail, says Feather. While science 
    can't date the iron fragments around it, he adds, the crosses are significant: 
    someone used them to mark an area believed to contain parts of a nail used 
    in the True Cross. &quot;We're in the realm of speculation,&quot; he concedes, 
    &quot;but you cannot rule it out. Some people had faith in it, and faith is 
    a wondrous thing.&quot; This mystery may well be eternal.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ORIGIN AND SOURCES 
  OF THE FOUR GOSPELS</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While we do not know where or by 
    whom the Four New Testament gospels were written, scholars realize that they 
    are compilations assembled by what we would call today editors, who drew on 
    various traditions, both oral and written, of the early Christian communities. 
    Because of this, the written gospels originate from complex layers of earlier 
    materials from a wide variety of sources. These include collections of &quot;sayings 
    of the Lord&quot; (like the sayings Gospel of Thomas), collections of miracle 
    stories used by early Christian missionaries, dialogues attributed to Jesus, 
    a passion narrative, miscellaneous legends, and other special sources specific 
    to individual gospels, to name the most obvious.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From a historical standpoint, this 
    diversity of sources makes it difficult to paint an accurate portrait of the 
    historical Jesus. While there are undoubtedly some historically reliable teachings 
    and accounts of Jesus in the New Testament, it's impossible to know which 
    ones are and which ones aren't. This fact was recognized long ago by the early 
    church father Origen, who pointed out that some incidents related in the gospels 
    never took place in a &quot;material&quot; or &quot;corporeal&quot; sense, 
    but are spiritual allegories meant to be studied as such; as he states clearly, 
    &quot;the careful student may observe countless other instances in the Gospels, 
    and may thus be convinced that with the historical events, literally true, 
    different ones are interwoven which never occurred.&quot;</font>...Jesus Christ

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)...</font><b>In the off-season, 
  the serious mystery cultists arrive. Through the years, a goodly number have 
  decided to live nearby. On a fine early spring morning, before the tourists 
  arrive, it is possible to meet as many as half a dozen different researchers 
  and theorists out measuring the cemetery or taking photographs of the Celtic 
  fortifications revealed when the road up from Couiza was widened in the 1970's. 
  But, unlike UFO conventions or the caravans of crop circle followers, the Rennes 
  mystery cultists are a close-mouthed lot. An air of secretiveness and paranoia 
  lingers, stimulated perhaps by the recitations of all the sudden and mysterious 
  deaths which litter the story line. </b></p>

<p><b>I stumbled onto the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau through the back door. 
  I was looking for it, but didn't know what it was. I was concentrating on KING 
  RENE OF ANJOU as the author or spark of inspiration for the EARLY TAROT CARDS. 
  It seemed so obvious, the Viscounti-Sforza deck was given by King Rene to the 
  Milanese newly-weds, and the earliest popular deck, the Marseilles Gypsy Tarot, 
  appeared at the same time and in territory that King Rene ruled. What I could 
  not figure out was what made King Rene so important. Something was missing from 
  his obvious connections and genealogy, some nuance unspoken, that would allow 
  him to become KING OF JERUSALEM, an empty title in the 15th century but indicative 
  of something, as well as Count of Provence and Duke of Anjou. </b></p>
<p><b>A few years later, some one handed me a copy of HOLY BLOOD/HOLY GRAIL, and 
  I found that there were indeed reasons why King Rene had the influence he did. 
  But it must go deeper than just being THE GRAND MASTER OF A SECRET SOCIETY. 
  He was appointed to that post while still a child, if Holy Blood/Holy Grail 
  is correct, therefore implying some sort of hereditary legitimacy. I found myself 
  agreeing with the basic IDEA OF A BLOODLINE, of which King Rene represented 
  the last culmination.</b></p>
<p><b>But whose bloodline? The authors of Holy Blood/Holy Grail suggest that it 
  is that of Jesus Himself, THROUGH HIS WIFE MARY MAGDALENE</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  (Thunder, Perfect Mind) </font><b>and their children. This is quite intriguing, 
  on several counts. But is there any evidence? And if there is, what does it 
  have to do with either King Rene or Rennes-le-Chateau?</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Three</b></p>
<p><b>Rene, as the Count of Provence, had powerful connections to the Holy Family 
  AND THE ORIGINS OF CHRISTIANITY IN EUROPE. To understand these connections, 
  we must step back and look at the history of the region as a whole.</b></p>
<p><b>The Rhone River begins as clay-filled glacial run off high in the Swiss 
  Alps. It winds its milky way across Switzerland, emptying its alluvial deposits 
  at last into Lake Geneva and becoming, as Byron put it, &quot;the blue rushing 
  of the arrowy Rhone.&quot; After curving through the foothills of the western 
  Alps, The Rhone falls into a deep valley and turns south, running along the 
  natural gap between the Cevennes Mountains and the French Alps toward the sea. 
  For over 100 miles, the river follows the valley, hugging the eastern edge of 
  the Cevennes, until, as the mountains fall away to the east and the west, it 
  gathers its tributaries and fans out in a wide delta across the head of the 
  Gulf of Lions, a small arm of the Mediterranean Sea.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/dragon.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p><b>Just before the Rhone splits into its two main channels, a last straggling 
  arm of the Alps, the Alpilles, reaches westward, ending in a jumbled and rocky 
  promontory a few miles from the river. This protective line of hills forms the 
  base line of another delta, or triangle, with the upper lines created by the 
  confluence of the Durrance and the Rhone. Within this secure and fertile triangle, 
  successive waves of ancient cultures established their communities and towns. 
  Neolithic farmers arrived early in the seventh millennium BCE and dwelt in Arcadian 
  simplicity until Bronze Age trading cultures, such AS THE EGYPTIAN, MYCENEAN 
  AND PHOENICIAN BEGAN TO ARRIVE IN THE SECOND MILLENIUM BCE. Soon after this 
  contact, Celtic tribes began to filter down the river from their European homeland 
  north of Lake Geneva and conquered or integrated with the local culture to form 
  A UNIQUE VARIETY OF GALLIC CELT</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  </font>(understand Paul's Letter to the Galatians)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
<p><b>More than half a millennium before the birth of Christ, Greek traders built 
  a fortress a few miles to the southwest of the old Celtic town, at the point 
  where the Rhone forks. The trading center retained the AR of the Argonauts, 
  the Greek heroes WHO ORIGINALLY SAILED UP THE RHONE in search of Celtic gold. 
  ARLES, now known mostly for the visits of artists such as Van Gogh and Gaugin, 
  began as a center of Greek culture in a barbarian paradise. The two communities 
  mixed and grew into a larger city nestled in the protected delta north of the 
  low range of volcanic hills, the Alpilles, near the present day town of St. 
  Remy de Provence.</b></p>
<p><b>This Gallo-Greek city entered the Roman Empire in 46 BCE as the acquisition 
  of Julius Caesar and received the name Glanum Livii. Even its name, a Romanized 
  version of some Gallo-Greek original, suggests the locality's curious cultural 
  and linguistic overlapping. The ambiguity of its literal meaning -- Blue Swelling? 
  -- indicates a complex of similar homophones in the interrelated languages of 
  the region which gave the town its name. A similar and possibly related method 
  of homophonic symbolism within the Provencal language would evolve over time 
  into the Green Language of the Troubadors. </b></p>
<p><b>Lost for almost 1700 years -- Glanum disappeared from history in the generation 
  after 270 CE and was not rediscovered until 1921 -- this ancient city holds 
  the key to THE &quot;UNDERGROUND STREAM,&quot; THE HIDDEN MYSTERIES OF WESTERN 
  ESOTERICISM. From Parzival and THE HOLY GRAIL TO ALCHEMY and the mystery of 
  the cathedrals, from the origins of the Tarot cards to THE HEBREW/DRUIDIC/ARTHURIAN 
  CABALA, most of the major currents flowing through the underground stream surface, 
  or have their origin, within a few miles of the lost Roman city of Glanum.</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  (Look deeper).</font></p>
<p><b>Michel Nostradamus, the justly famous Seer OF PROVENCE, was born barely 
  a mile from the Arch and the &quot;pyramid,&quot; as the Augustinian mausoleum 
  was called in the 16th century. In Nostradamus' time, these two monuments were 
  all that remained above ground of Glanum. They are still standing today, stark 
  reminders along the modern road into the Alpilles of the area's ancient past. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>Today's visitor, standing under the two millennium old and still acoustically 
  perfect Arch, gazes out on the excavations of Glanum and, if he is somewhat 
  imaginative, can glimpse in his mind's eye its antique glory. In the near distance, 
  the discerning visitor will note an oddly shaped hill with a perfect round hole 
  in its side. At the foot of this hill is the Monastery of St. Paul de Manseole, 
  a 12th century church and cloister that now serves as a psychiatric hospital. 
  Van Gogh was committed there for a time before returning to Paris and committing 
  suicide.</b></p>
<p><b>Nostradamus mentions this area in six of his enigmatic and prophetic quatrains 
  and connects it with the symbolic term &quot;mansol&quot; AND THE DISCOVERY 
  OF A GREAT &quot;TREASURE&quot; OR SECRET. Perhaps Nostradamus foresaw the rediscovery 
  of Glanum, full of Roman and Gallo-Greek treasures, in 1921, or perhaps the 
  Seer of Provence was pointing TO THE SECRET OF THE WESTERN TRADITION, the holy 
  grail of esotericism, still waiting to be discovered among it ruins. Perhaps, 
  as Nostradamus seems to suggest, hidden near the pierced hill above the monastery 
  of Manseole.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Four</b></p>
<p><b>While a secret may remain hidden near Glanum, other clues to Provence's 
  unusual role in the history of western esotericism, including ITS HEBREW AND 
  GNOSTIC CHRISTIAN ROOTS, are hidden in plain sight. At Arles, which has often 
  been called the soul of Provence, Greek and Roman relics abound. It is but a 
  brief walk from the lovely Roman arena, equal in elegance if not in scale to 
  Rome's Coliseum, to the town square where a curious Romanesque church with a 
  Gothic facade draws the attention of THE SERIOUS HERMETIC STUDENT. </b></p>
<p><b>On sunny Sunday afternoons in the spring, the tour guides compete with Hurdy-Gurdy 
  music and the laughter of children as they explain the images on the church 
  front in terms of Hercules' labors. Few tourists ponder why a Christian Church 
  in Provence uses the symbolism of ancient Greek myth, why its Saint is called 
  Trophime, or Trophy, or even why Frederick Barbarossa, the Holy Roman Emperor 
  in the late 12th century, chose Arles and St. Trophime for his coronation?</b></p>
<p><b>Attempting to answer these questions takes us DEEP INTO THE HEART OF THE 
  GRAIL LEGENDS. The coronation of Frederick Barbarossa appears to be the key 
  point of diffusion, the place and time where the Grail myths entered the story 
  of King Arthur. As many other researcher have found, the Grail stories have 
  much to do with a bloodline, the possible descendants of Jesus, hence the Green 
  Language-esque pun of Sang Real, holy blood, out of San Graal, holy grail. Could 
  the Trophy of St. Trophime be the Holy Grail? (As a strong man to win a race). 
  Even though the Hercules connection will remain obscure for a while -- it is 
  part of the deepest secret current of the underground stream -- the area does 
  present us with a solid and tangible link to the Holy Family.</b></p>
<p><b>Further to the southwest of Arles, where the western branch of the Rhone 
  flows into the Mediterranean, stood AN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN PORT AND LIGHTHOUSE, 
  founded perhaps a thousand years before the Greek traders arrived. Called Ra 
  by the Romans, this lighthouse and port marked the turning point in the channel 
  that brought Egyptian merchant ships into the Rhone. Today, the ruins of the 
  Egypto-Roman fortress of Ra lies a quarter mile beyond the breakwater off the 
  small beach town of Les Stes. Maries de-le-Mer. However, this resort town, far 
  off the beaten path at the end of a region of marshes and tidal flats called 
  the Carmargue, holds the key to the mystery of what happened to the Holy Family 
  after the death and possible resurrection/ascension of Jesus in Palestine. </b></p>
<p><b>Hebrew migration to the region around the mouth of the Rhone began with 
  the era of Greek colonization spurred on by Alexander's conquests in the east. 
  The flow increased in the early 1st century of the Common Era under the encouragement 
  of the Roman Emperor Octavius Augustus. After the destruction of Palestine in 
  70 CE, the flow became a torrent, and some of these Hebrew refugees were Christians.</b></p>
<p><b>Provencal tradition relates that soon after the events in Palestine, a shipload 
  of Jesus' relatives landed off the old Roman fort of Ra, near present day Les 
  Stes. Maries de-la-Mer. By all accounts, the group included three Marys, covering 
  THE INTERWOVEN FAMILIES OF JESUS AND JOHN THE BAPTIST. One of the three was 
  MARY MAGDELENE, FIRST WITNESS TO THE RESURRECTION and, by Gnostic accounts, 
  Jesus' foremost disciple and wife...</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Magdaline.gif" width="616" height="259"></p>
<p align="center"><b>The Last Supper (Jesus and the Magdalene) by Da Vinci</b></p>
<p><b>Also included were Martha and Lazarus, members of the Magdalene's family, 
  a few local Romanized Jews including Maximinius and Sidonius, the blind man 
  from Jericho, and, either welcoming them home or included miraculously as part 
  of the ship's company, SARAH THE EGYPTIAN. Tradition relates that THE GROUP 
  SPREAD OUT THROUGH PROVENCE and preached the Good News with such success that 
  by the time of the destruction of the Temple and the Diaspora, barely more than 
  a generation later, Provence was at least partially converted to Christianity.</b></p>
<p><b>Two of the Marys, along with Sarah the Egyptian, remained in the sea-side 
  village where they landed. When they died, around 50 CE, St. Trophime himself 
  came from Arles to administer the last rites. The three were buried near a small 
  oratory or chapel they had built in the center of the village. In the 9th century, 
  a new church was built over the oratory and the graves, and, fortified, it became 
  part of the town walls. When Good King Rene, Count of Provence, excavated the 
  old church in the 1440's looking for the Holy Grail, he found the holy relics 
  of the two Mary's and Sarah. King Rene built a lofty and imposing church of 
  pinkish stone to house them. With its parapets, merlons, embrasures and internal 
  fresh-water spring, the church acted as a virtually impregnable fortress designed 
  to protect the town's inhabitants from Moorish pirates and other marauders.

<p><b>Stepping into the cool darkness of the church from the bright clear sunlight 
  of Provence is to step back into another age, an age of faith that was at least 
  superficially Christian, but actually illuminated, from within as it were, BY 
  THE ANTIQUITY OF ITS GODDESS WORSHIP. Under the chancel, a flight of stairs 
  leads down to the crypt, where King Rene found the bones of Sarah and the two 
  Marys. Blackened by the candles of myriads of pilgrims, most of them Gypsies 
  who come to pray before the statue of Sarah, the crypt envelopes the visitor 
  with an atmosphere of dark and earthy mysteries. If this is Christianity, it's 
  far different from its more orthodox varieties. HERE, THE FEMININE IS NOT EXCLUDED, 
  but worshipped in a manner that is far more primitive than early Christianity 
  itself.</b></p>
<p><b>This impression is heightened during the Fete of May, when the Gypsies gather 
  to honor Saint Sarah and the two Marys. For several days prior to the festivals 
  on the 24th and 25th of May, Gypsies from all over Provence, southern France 
  and northern Italy pour into Les Stes Maries de-le-Mer, some still in their 
  colorful horse-drawn caravans. THE THREE DAY FESTIVAL begins by taking down 
  the reliquaries of the two Marys from their chapel above the chancel. The relics 
  are left on display while the statue of Sarah is brought up from the crypt, 
  draped in many rich cloaks and paraded down to the sea. </b></p>
<p><b>The next day it is the two Marys' turn to make the journey. Standing in 
  a small blue boat, piled high with roses, and holding an urn full of healing 
  balm -- the Holy Grail? -- the two Marys travel on the shoulders of their four 
  guardians down to the sea where they landed almost two millennium ago. In this 
  simple ritual can be heard echoes of a Goddess tradition going back to Egypt 
  and beyond. After the Marys are returned to their chapel, the dancing and singing 
  goes on late into the night as the crowds prepare for the third day's BULL FIGHTS, 
  bandido runs and parties in honor of the Gypsy benefactor, Folco de Baroncelli. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>These celebrations mark a fountainhead. Like the spring in the church of 
  the two Marys, one of many miraculous springs and wells we will find along the 
  way, these traditions serve as a source point for the broad esoteric current 
  that King Rene himself labeled the underground stream of lost Arcadia. And with 
  this knowledge -- the mystery hidden in plain sight, known to the Gypsies and 
  the common folk -- the true history of that underground stream, THE GNOSTIC 
  CHRISTIANITY OF THE WEST, can be traced through the centuries.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Five</b></p>
<p><b>Among the many traditional images used to describe this underground stream, 
  that of grafting vines and growing grapes, the viticulture and alchemy of wine-making, 
  has an unusual prominence. Standing in the midst of the vineyard planted by 
  Nostradamus' grandfather, Jean de St. Remy, at the Chateau Roussan, not far 
  from the Roman city of Glanum, it is easy to see in this grafting of vines, 
  the grafting of cultures, from Egyptian to Celtic to Greek to Hebrew, WHICH 
  FINALLY PRODUCED THE FRUIT of a specifically European Gnostic Christianity and 
  THE WINE OF MEDIEVAL ESOTERIC WISDOM. On the land, the metaphor has A MEANING 
  ROOTED IN THE MYTHOLOGY OF ITS HISTORY. In the course of an afternoon's drive, 
  from St. Remy to the sea, one can visit the monuments, hidden in plain sight, 
  of this esoteric history. </b></p>
<p><b>King Rene was aware of all this. It was of course his County, and after 
  his departure from European power politics in the late 1440's, he devoted his 
  life to the mystery. Jean de St. Remy, Nostradamus' grandfather, was personal 
  physician to King Rene in the late 1470's and early 1480's after Rene RETURNED 
  TO PROVENCE. Rene's interest in the foremost Jewish family in St. Remy might 
  be based on more than their medical skills. Pierre, Jean's son and Michel's 
  father, changed his name to NOSTRADOME, OR OUR LADY, suggesting some link with 
  the Holy Family. Michel Nostradamus, as he Latinized the name, enjoyed a great 
  degree of noble and even royal support all out of proportion to his position 
  as a poor doctor from a recently converted family. </b></p>
<p><b>If we are looking therefore for the lost tomb of Jesus or his descendants, 
  then we might profitably speculate that it lies in Provence, possibly somewhere 
  near Glanum. We might even follow Nostradamus' suggestions and look toward the 
  caves above the monastery at Manseole as a likely location. Nothing however 
  suggests any connection with Rennes-le-Chateau. Nostradamus passed through the 
  area during his travels, but we have no evidence of his visiting anywhere south 
  of Carcassone. If he had discovered anything at Rennes-le-Chateau, then we might 
  expect it show up in his quatrains or other prophetic writings. In fact, he 
  mentions Carcassone several times, pointing to the Wars of Religion, the Napoleonic 
  Wars and a possible future nuclear conflict, but not a whisper of a secret or 
  a great treasure.</b></p>
<p><b>For that, Nostradamus points to Toulouse. In a three part prophecy/treasure 
  hunt, (VI/98 and VIII/29-30) Nostradamus tells us the story of the ancient Volcae, 
  the Celtic people who inhabited the Languedoc in pre-Roman times, and their 
  karmic retribution at the hands of a Roman consul in 109 BCE. The Volcae were 
  said to have amassed a vast horde of treasure, hidden IN A SACRED WELL, current 
  site of the church of St. Saturnin-du-Taur in Toulouse. This was looted by a 
  Roman army under Consul Caepio, who mysteriously never made it to Rome with 
  his treasure. Nostradamus tells us it was miraculously restored, to be found 
  at some future date.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/RomanEmpire1stCentury.gif" width="600" height="447"></p>
<p><b>To my knowledge, no one has yet tried to connect this with the Mystery of 
  Rennes-le-Chateau. However, it just might be that Nostradamus is pointing to 
  exactly that. The first line of quatrain VIII/30 can be also be read, with a 
  Green Language twist, as &quot;NOT WITHIN TOULOUSE, THE DISTANT HEAD ROCK.&quot; 
  The second line suggests that IT WILLL BE FOUND AS SOMEONE DIGS THE FOUNDATION 
  FOR A &quot;PALACE OF SPECTACLE,&quot; perhaps a stadium or a theater complex 
  according to some interpreters, while the third line suggests that it will &quot;vex&quot; 
  everyone after its discovery. The fourth line suggests that three caches will 
  be found, one of them near the Bazacle.</b></p>

<p align="center"><i><b>Is not this hidden with me among my treasures?...</b></i><b>Deuteronomy

<p><b>History records that Consul Caepio lost his treasure before he returned 
  to Marseilles. Perhaps he was compelled to return it, but more probably he was 
  attacked by a band of Volcae resistance fighters who took the treasure from 
  him. Either way, it is hardly likely that the Volcae replaced the treasure IN 
  ITS OLD, NOW VIOLATED, HIDING PLACE. More likely, it was re-hidden in or near 
  the major city of the region where it was seized, the hill-top fortress of Rhedae, 
  present day Rennes-le-Chateau. Perhaps the persistent rumors of hidden treasure 
  at Rennes-le-Chateau go back to the lost treasure-horde of the Volcae. Equally 
  interesting is that Nostradamus seems to be the only one aware of this origin.</b></p>
<p><b>&quot;Not within Toulouse,&quot; but within the fortress of Rhedae, with 
  its distant view of Pech Cardou -- a genuine &quot;beluze&quot; OR HEADROCK 
  in Provencal -- the treasure will be found while making a deep pit for a palace 
  of spectacle. Father Sauniere's excavations could easily be the deep pit, and 
  his Villa Bethania would qualify as a &quot;palace of spectacle&quot; to Nostradamus. 
  The discovery has certainly vexed its finders, and everyone else who gets involved. 
  The last lines suggest that Sauniere found two caches in Rennes-le-Chateau and 
  one near Bazacle. This could be a Green Language contraction of Bezu castle 
  or conclave, referring to the Templar fortress at St. Just le Bezu, just south 
  of Rennes-le-Chateau. </b></p>
<p><b>This interpretation of Nostradamus' quatrain is no more strained than any 
  other, and a good deal more historically accurate than many. But even if Nostradamus 
  is pointing in these quatrains to the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, does it 
  really have any connection with the Holy Family and their bloodline? Given the 
  other clues with which Nostradamus supplies us about the family and the secret 
  in Provence, we must conclude that this auxiliary mystery is mainly concerned 
  with a treasure, even if a somewhat miraculous one.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/MichaelAxis.GIF" width="500" height="397"></p>
<p><b>However, Nostradamus' quatrain does plunge us into the heart of whatever 
  the mystery truly lies at Rennes-le-Chateau. Henry Lincoln, one of the co-authors 
  of Holy Blood/Holy Grail, has said that the only certainty about the mystery 
  of Rennes-le-Chateau was its connection WITH PENTAGONAL GEOMETRY. This certainty 
  is suggested by Nostradamus' quatrain -- Rennes-le-Chateau and Bezu are connected 
  by just such pentagonal geometry. Five churches or sacred sites, all built on 
  hilltops on the site of older structures, form a perfect pentagon with its center 
  near the megalithic sites known locally as Balancing Rock and the Devil's Chair. 
  Two of these five sites are the churches in Rennes-le-Chateau and Bezu. Between 
  them is the ruin at Serre de Lauzet, with THE CHAPEL OF BLANCHEFORT and the 
  megalith at la Soulane as the other two points.</b></p>
<p><b>It is hard to know what to think of this arrangement, too precise to be 
  coincidental. Each site has a history reaching back to at least the Celtic Volcae. 
  They were all there in the late 2nd century BCE when Consul Caepio was compelled 
  to give up his loot. Blanchefort is not far from where the Roman road from Carcassone 
  to Beziers passes through a series of mountainous gaps, the COL du PARADIS, 
  perfect spot to ambush a Roman treasure train. Could the treasure of the Volcae 
  have been retaken from the Romans and hidden within this vast pentagonal temple?</b></p>

<p><b>West of the Rhone, the coast curves south across the mouth of the Naurouze 
  gap which separates the eastern Pyrenees from the central highlands of France. 
  Greek traders established cities at Montpelier, Narbonne and Perpignan along 
  the coast, but the uplands were controlled by the powerful Celtic tribes related 
  to the Volcae. Rome absorbed the region in the 1st century BCE, but it retained 
  its Celtic identity until the arrival of the Visigoths in the 5th century CE. 
  This powerful Celtic confederacy had its capital at Toulouse, where THE HIGH 
  KING of the Volcae ruled. THIS CELTIC ARTHUR FIGURE ruled over an ancient and 
  prosperous land with a millennium old civilization when the Romans came to plunder.</b></p>
<p><b>Neolithic hunters originally discovered the limestone escarpment that would 
  become Rennes-le-Chateau. Its bare rock and imposing view would have been valuable 
  to hunter bands following the bison herds across the valleys. The early Celts 
  fortified the hilltop and by the 2nd century BCE, it was a guard post on the 
  Greek trading route from Perpignan to Carcassone and Toulouse. The Greeks referred 
  to the local clan as the Tectosages, or wise builders. The military importance 
  of Rennes-le-Chateau was recognized by every conqueror down to the French Wars 
  of Religion in the 16th century.</b></p>
<p><b>The Romans refortified in the 1st century CE, and built many villas and 
  baths in the area, including the thermal baths at Rennes-le-Bains. For a few

  east. Becoming involved in Imperial politics, Alaric almost apologetically sacked

  no help from them at Mulvian Bridge. A few years later, in the late 4th century, 
  the region could be considered somewhat Christian, enough to be assigned a Bishop

<p><b>When history fails, it is permissible to look to legends and myths for answers.

  why didn't they find them in Provence?</b></p>

<p align="center"><i><font size="+1">The Mystery of Iniquity doth already work</font></i><font size="+1">...Paul 
  (2 Timothy 2:7).</font></p>
<p><b>There are other intriguing connections. The Visigoths, on exposure to the 
  Biblical themes of the Arian Saint Ulfius who converted them, immediately identified 
  themselves as one of the Lost Tribes of the Jews. They embraced Christianity 
  through their supposed Judaism, HENCE THEIR AMBIGUITY TOWARD ROME. Once Alaric 
  seized THE TREASURES OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE, there was nowhere to go but the NEW 
  JERUSALEM. Provence had the largest Jewish</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  (kabbalistic) </font><b>population in the west, but, either because it was too 
  civilized or did not have what they were looking for, the Visigoths continued 
  west into Languedoc. If they were looking for the Holy Family, why didn't they 
  find them at Glanum? The simple answer is that by the early 5th century, Glanum 
  no longer existed. </b></p>
<p><b>The last decade of the 3rd century CE saw the worst persecutions of Christians, 
  particularly in the west. Provence, as the center of European Christianity, 
  was hard hit. The Bishop of Arles was forced to recant and apparently the entire 
  Jewish Christian population of the Glanum region was displaced. In 270 CE, Glanum 
  Livii was a prosperous city, by 306 CE, it had disappeared completely. The ruins 
  suggest that while there was some disorder, the city was essentially abandoned. 
  Tradition, perhaps the same one Alaric's Visigoths heard, tells that they moved 
  west, toward the Pyrenees.</b></p>
<p><b>As the Imperial Church formed in the east, the Holy Family and with them 
  the original Christianity of Provence moved west into a region whose Christianity 
  was superficial at best. The transition seems to have gone smoothly, perhaps 
  eased by both groups' dislike of Roman control. Interestingly enough, the earliest 
  of these 4th century CE Christian ruins can be found between Carcassone and 
  Rennes-le-Chateau, most prominently at Alet-le-Bains and Limoux.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/GothsAndFranks.gif" width="400" height="516"></p>
<p><b>The arrival of the Visigoths caused considerably more upheaval. By the early 
  6th century, after wars and invasions and a defeat by Clovis, the Merovingian 
  king of the Franks, the countryside had settled into a new version of the old 
  pattern. The legend suggests that the Visigoths may have stashed the treasure 
  of the Temple at Jerusalem with the Volcae horde somewhere near Rhedae, or Rennes-le-Chateau. 
  Languedoc was the one part of the Visigothic region, which extended across the 
  Pyrenees into Spain, they were unwilling to cede to Clovis. They certainly became 
  the new overlords of the Languedoc and blended with the previous waves of immigrants, 
  including the Jews and Christians from Provence, to create a different kind 
  of culture. They blended so well in fact that the word Goth became interchangeable 
  with Jew and the region itself was called Gothia. </b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Eight</b></p>
<p><b>As the Gothic principalities developed in the Languedoc, a new power emerged 
  to fill the vacuum left by the collapsing Empire. This was of course the Merovingian 
  Franks of Clovis I, who came out on top of the anarchy in the late 5th century 
  BY MAKING A DEAL WITH THE ROMAN CHURCH. The Merovingians also had obscure origins 
  and connections to a mysterious bloodline. The evidence for this is less than 
  that for a Visigothic connection with the Holy Family, but the stories of Clovis' 
  great-grandfather Merovee I, unusual name for a pagan chieftain, do suggest 
  an illegitimate relationship with some kind of a miraculous bloodline. </b></p>
<p><b>The Western Empire had fallen to pieces by the turn of the 6th century. 
  Theodoric, an Ostrogoth, ruled as King of Italy, and the eastern Emperor, Anastasius, 
  controlled only widely scattered fragments of the western empire, including 
  the Imperial city of Arles in Provence. Clovis, confirmed by the Church as the 
  King of the Franks AND PROTECTOR OF THE FAITH, turned at last to the Arian heretics 
  of the Languedoc. A three-sided conflict developed between Theodoric, Clovis 
  and the Visigothic High-King Alaric II. </b></p>
<p><b>Clovis and Alaric met in battle at Vouille, near Poitiers, in 507 CE. Clovis 
  won a great victory and drove the Visigoths completely out of France, over the 
  Pyrennes into Spain. However, Clovis' allies, the Burgundians, had in the meantime 
  besieged Arles. Theodoric, thinking this was much to close to Italy for his 
  liking, sent an army to relieve the siege. PEACE TALKS FOLLOWED</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  (sound still familiar?), </font><b>in which Theodoric restored the Languedoc, 
  called Septimania for THE SEVEN or clans it covered, to the Visigoths. The basis 
  of Septimania's sovereignty rests on this decision by King Theodoric. </b></p>
<p><b>The Merovingians entered the story of Languedoc and Rennes-le-Chateau in 
  671 when Dagobert II married Giselle de Razes, daughter of the Count of Razes 
  and the niece of the Visigothic High King. Razes of course was the current name 
  for Rhedae and its surroundings. </b></p>
<p><b>Merovee II was proclaimed king of the Franks in 448 CE, and his grandson, 
  Clovis I, made the Franks rulers of most of modern France. On his death in 511 
  CE, the kingdom -- which included all of modern France except Brittany, Languedoc, 
  Provence and the Burgundian homelands around the headwaters of the Rhone was 
  divided between his four sons. Dagobert II was born in 651 CE, heir to the Frankish 
  heartland of Austrasia in northeastern France and western Germany, a region 
  that, much later, became the source point of THE HAPSBURG DYNASTY. </b></p>
<p><b>When his father died in 656, Dagobert's life became a version of the legend 
  of the lost prince. Abducted by the mayor of the palace, one Grimoald, Dagobert 
  was passed from the Bishop of Poitiers to an Irish monastery, where he received 
  a superb education unavailable to him on the continent. In 666 CE, he married 
  a Celtic princess, Mathilde OF YORK, and moved to England. There he met the 
  Bishop of York, Saint Wilfrid, who became his friend and benefactor.</b></p>
<p><b>When his Celtic wife died in 670 CE, Wilfrid helped arrange a second marriage 
  to Giselle de Razes. They were married in the old Visgothic chapel to Mary Magdalene, 
  on the site of Sauniere's church, in 671. By 674, things had changed, and Dagobert 
  was recognized as the king of Austrasia. Two years later, a son and heir, Sigisbert 
  IV, was born. However, Dagobert was a strong king with many ideas that the church, 
  including St. Wilfrid, did not like once he was in power. On December 23, 679 
  CE, he was murdered while out hunting near the royal palace at Stenay. Queen 
  Giselle fled with a small group of knights and the infant Sigisbert to the Razes, 
  where in 681, the young prince assumed his uncle's titles of Duke of Razes and 
  Count of the Rhedae.</b></p>
<p><b>Although an attempt was made to write Dagobert out of history, and so undercut 
  any claims by his son, he clearly existed. His antagonism toward the Roman church 
  made him dangerous, and his marriage into A MYSTERIOUS JEWISH VISIGOTHIC BLOODLINE 
  made his son doubly dangerous. The Merovingians obviously thought that they 
  had some divine right to kingship conferred by their unusual bloodline. However, 
  this may not have been a specifically Christian divine right. Merovee I was 
  a confirmed pagan and a worshipper OF THE VIRGIN DiANA of THE NINE FIRES. His 
  mother's encounter with the Quinotaur should be seen in that light. </b></p>
<p><b>And yet, the marriage of Dagobert II and Giselle of Razes combined the two 
  bloodlines, that of the Holy Family and that of a pagan divine beast, the Quinotaur. 
  The connection between the Merovingians and the Holy Family seems to have been 
  hind-shadowed by this union of the bloodlines, when indeed they would seem from 
  contemporary sources to be A KIND OF PENDRAGON LINEAGE, such as Vortigern and 
  Arthur in Britain. In Sigisbert IV, it appears the bloodlines of THE DIVINE 
  KING AND THE WORLD TEACHER combined...</b></p>

<p><b>Given the events of his childhood, it is natural that Sigsbert, the new

  is a charter for a monastery signed in 718 by &quot;Sigebert, Comte de Rhedae, 
  and his wife Magdala.&quot; By the time the last Merovingians died out in 754

<p><b>Other changes had occurred. THE ARABS INVADED FROM SPAIN and were barely

  popularity was enormous, Charles the Hammer, mayor of the palace, could never 
  be persuaded to get rid of the Merovingian King, Childeric III. The Hammer's 
  son, Pepin III, also known as the Short, had no such compunctions, and Childeric 
  died in 754. Pepin's son, Charles the Magnificent, or Charlemagne, restored 
  the kingdom of the Franks AND USED IT AS A POWER BASE TO REVIVE THE ROMAN EMPIRE 
  OF THE WEST.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Revelation, chapter 17 (KJV).</b></p>
<p><b>In the meantime, Languedoc itself had gone through some changes. It was 
  now a sovereign kingdom with its own Jewish King. Life was perhaps not kind 
  to Sigisbert, with the cruelest trial saved for old age. In 711 CE, the Arabs 
  over ran the region to the south, and soon after Sigisbert and his wife chartered 
  their monastery, the Arabs crossed the Pyrenees and swept through Languedoc. 
  From 720 to 759 CE, Languedoc was a Moorish province of the Emir of Cordova, 
  semi-autonomous and with a capital at Narbonne. From here, the Arabs pushed 
  north towards the heart of France. </b></p>
<p><b>They were stopped by Charles Martel, and by 738 Charles was hammering at 
  the gates of Narbonne. This proved to be a tough nut to crack, and the Hammer 
  VENTED HIS RAGE on the countryside. Narbonne never fell and 21 years later, 
  Charles' son, Pepin the Short, cut a very strange deal with its Jewish population. 
  If they would switch sides and help legitimize his authority as the rightful 
  king, he would grant them their own kingdom and ruler. THE JEWS, OR GOTHS, of 
  Narbonne AGREED and turned on the Moslem defenders. Pepin kept his part of the 
  bargain and in 768 recreated THE GOTHIC/JEWISH KINGDOM OF SEPTIMANIA WITH ITS 
  OWN KING OF THE JEWS.</b></p>
<p><b>This was none other than &quot;Aymery,&quot; or Bera III, Count of Rhedae, 
  grandson of Sigisbert IV, who took the good Visigothic name of Theodoric -- 
  a nod perhaps to Theodoric, King of Italy, who created the first kingdom of 
  Septimania in 509 -- when he became king. THE CREATION OF A JEWISH KINGDOM, 
  seven hundred years after the fall of Jerusalem, was a world-wide event. Jewish 
  elders from Babylon officiated at Theodoric's consecration AND HE WAS PROCLAIMED 
  AS &quot;THE SEED OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF DAVID&quot; by both Pepin the Short 
  and the Caliph of Baghdad. Theodoric strengthened his position by marrying Pepin's 
  sister Alda, the future Charlemagne's aunt. </b></p>
<p><b>The son of Theodoric was one of the heroes of the age. Guillem de Gellone 
  held the titles of Count of Barcelona, for whose conquest he was acclaimed, 
  Count of Toulouse, which made him the Celtic/Visigothic High King, Count of 
  Auvergne, where two centuries later the future Pope Sylvester would be born, 
  and of course, Count of the Razes. He was considered one of Charlemagne's Peers, 
  on a level with Roland and Olivier, and later became the focus of medieval epic 
  romance. Before the Crusades, at least six major works were written about his 
  exploits.</b></p>
<p><b>In the first decades of the 13th century, at the height of the popularity 
  of the Grail Romances, Wolfram von Eschenbach, whose Parzival is the most complete 
  explication of the Grail legend, was working on an epic poem about the life 
  of Guillem de Gellone. Wolfram's Wilhelm was unfinished at his death, and marks 
  a curious departure for the German poet. His other work had all been about the 
  Grail and its family connections. Could Wilhelm also be related to the Grail 
  legends and the Holy Family?</b></p>
<p><b>Given his Merovingian and Gothic/Jewish background, such a connection is 
  quite likely. Indeed, it is possible to use the local descriptions given in 
  Parzival and Wilhelm to trace out on the ground the outlines of the Grail legend. 
  Wolfram is describing a real story with historical roots. In Wilhelm, Wolfram 
  is pointing us in the right direction.</b></p>
<p><b>Guillem de Gellone remained close to Charlemagne. His sister married one 
  of the Emperor's sons, FORGING DYNASTIC LINKS BETWEEN THE FAMILIES. In fact, 
  when Charlemagne's son Louis was invested as Emperor, it was Guillem de Gellone 
  who crowned him. Louis made the unusual comment that &quot;it is your lineage 
  that has raised up mine.&quot; The autonomy of Septimania depended on its Merovingian/Gothic 
  king's support OF THE CAROLINGIANS' PRETENSIONS. To Guillem, it was apparently 
  a small price to pay.</b></p>
<p><b>Toward the end of his life, he founded a monastic academy near Gellone, 
  the famous St. Guillem-le-Desert, part OF WHICH NOW FORMS THE CLOISTERS ON THE 
  NORTHERN TIP OF MANHATTAN ISLAND IN NEW YORK. He imported scholars and built 
  a formidable library, and in 806, withdrew from public life. He is thought to 
  have died around 812, by which time his academy had become ONE OF THE FIRST 
  CENTERS OF THE MAGDALENE CULT WHICH WOULD SWEEP ALL EUROPE IN THE 12th AND 13th 
  CENTURIES.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Ten</b></p>
<p><b>After Guillem, the kingdom of Septimania declined. BY THE LATE 9th CENTURY 
  IT HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HISTORY and Guillem's bloodline had passed to the Dukes 
  of Aquitaine and Brittany. How this happened is a curious and murky story that 
  nevertheless may throw an interesting light ON THE MYTH OF KING ARTHUR.</b></p>
<p><b>One of Guillem's great nephews, Bernard de Razes, founded the Duchy of Aqutitaine 
  in the 870's. At the same time, his cousin, and Guillem's great-grandson, Sigisbert 
  VI was preparing to re-institute the Merovingian rulership of the Frankish Empire. 
  What seemed a small price to pay for peace to Guillem was seen as intolerable 
  by his descendants.</b></p>
<p><b>Charlemagne's great-grandson, Louis II, died leaving two small sons, Louis 
  III and Carloman and a regency of nobles led by Louis' brother the future Charles 
  III. Sensing weakness, Sigsbert VI, Count of Rhedae, Barcelona and Toulouse 
  attempted a power play. With the support of Bernard of Auvergne and the Marquis 
  of Gothie (Narbonne), Sigisbert was proclaimed King in 877 at a Te Deum in Nimes 
  ATTENDED BY 500 ECCLESIASTICALS. He took the title of URSUS, a version of the 
  Roman Celtic Arthur.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg167.gif" width="302" height="399"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Ursus, the Great Bear.</b></p>
<p><b>Sigisbert/Ursus marched off to confront the Carolingian regency and was 
  defeated near Poitiers in 879. He died or disappeared in Brittany, his family 
  merging with the Breton nobility. The lands in Languedoc were left without a 
  ruler, and by the early 10th century, other noble families had begun to divide 
  the region. The rulers of Aquitaine and Brittany had claim to the Visigothic/Merovingian 
  bloodline, and in Languedoc, the County of Rhedae passed to a collateral branch, 
  that of THE BLANCHEFORTS.</b></p>
<p><b>The exploits of King Ursus would have long echoes. These echoes provide 
  crucial links in the strange tale of the development of the Arthurian legends 
  and the Matter of Britain. The archetypal Arthur of Celtic myth, THE HIGH KING 
  WHO SAILED TO THE LAND OF THE DEAD AND RETRIEVED THE CAULDRON OF REGENERATION, 
  was the common property of the entire Celtic west, from Toulouse to Tara. The 
  High-King of the Volcae was an &quot;Arthur&quot; figure, as was the 5th century 
  High-King of the Bretons, Rhiotomas, who fought to restore the Roman Empire.</b></p>
<p><b>Much has been made of Rhiotomas as the historical Arthur of the Welsh and 
  British Chronicles. Indeed, he may have been the source for Gildas and the Venerable 
  Bede, but the Arthur of legend appears only with Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 
  mid 12th century. Something happened in the intervening centuries that allowed 
  Geoffrey to craft his tale with such impact. It is possible to speculate, given 
  the links available, that the revolt of King Ursus was somehow the defining 
  event in the creation of the legend.</b></p>
<p><b>One clue is Arthur's shield or coat of arms, WHICH WAS SAID TO CONTAIN THE 
  IMAGE OF THE VIRGIN. This has never been adequately explained, even by reference 
  to the Virgin Mother's stay at Glastonbury with Joseph of Arimathia. WHY WOULD 
  A CELTIC ARTHUR, EVEN OF THE 5th CENTURY, BE WEARING THE HERALDIC ARMS OF THE 
  HOLY FAMILY? However it is entirely likely that King Ursus went into battle 
  under just such a banner, openly acknowledging his bloodline. He would be the 
  Arthur that combined the Celtic and Christian elements of the story in an historical 
  event, as Wolfram insists was the case.</b></p>
<p><b>The other clue is Brittany. The family of King Ursus ended up in exile from 
  Languedoc and married into the nobility of the Duchy. There, the stories of 
  the Welsh Arthur, and even the exploits of Rhiotomas, became blended with the 
  family history. When Geoffrey, two centuries later, drew upon these Breton sources, 
  he found the story of a Celtic/Christian King Arthur ready-made. He added a 
  few specifically English elements, SUCH AS MERLIN, AND THE MATTER OF BRITAIN 
  WAS BORN</b></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../../UsedImages/DruidFestivals.gif" width="550" height="400">. 
  </font></p>
<p><b>But there are deeper and more intriguing implications. When we compare the 
  two historical Arthurs, Rhiotomas in the 5th century and King Ursus in the 9th, 
  we find the Merovingian connection. As I noted above, the Merovingian divine 
  right to be kings flowed from their somewhat irregular descent from a mythical 
  beast called the Quinotaur. It is curious to me that no one seems to have noticed 
  the linguistic similarity between Quinotaur, LITERALLY A FIVE BEAST, AND THE 
  CELTIC PENDRAGON OF ARTHUR. Although pendragon means HEAD OFF THE DRAGON, it 
  might easily be translated as five headed dragon or beast by different tribes 
  with only Latin or Greek as a common language.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg37rtglobeweb.gif" width="513" height="509"></p>
<p align="center"><b>The Head of the Dragon, the Great Leviathan. (Job 41).</b></p>
<p><b>Therefore we might more safely speculate that the Merovingians were the 
  bastard branch of the Roman/Celtic Pendragon clan which developed at the same 
  time in England, than that they had any connection with the Holy Family. Their 
  proximity to England in northern France also suggests that their divine right 
  to be kings of the Franks derived from their connection with the family of Vortigern 
  and his Pendragon dynasty.</b></p>
<p><b>In Rhiotomas' bid to restore the Empire four hundred years before Charlemagne 
  he was originally supported by Clovis' Franks. When the battle came, a few miles 
  east of Bourges in Berry, Rhiotomas was betrayed by the Franks and defeated. 
  A few years later, Clovis made his pact with the Roman church and became the 
  new High-King. From the perspective of the legend, this would make the Merovingians, 
  and Clovis in particular, into Mordred and his followers.</b></p>
<p><b>King Ursus' revolt can then be seen as an attempt to change all that, to 
  right the wrongs of a pagan usurper and at the same time restore the true faith. 
  His failure was written out of history, only to emerge a few centuries later 
  as the Arthurian romances and their marvelous fruit, the Grail legends.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Eleven</b></p>
<p><b>For the next few centuries, the region declined into a collection of feudal 
  principalities in various arrangements and alliances. Control of the Razes bounced 
  back and forth between the Counts of Carcassone and those of Barcelona, with 
  the local Blanchefort family caught in the middle. In the 11th century, Ermengarde, 
  daughter of the Count of Carcassone sold all of Rhedae to the house of Barcelona, 
  thinking this would settle the matter. It didn't; her descendants, the Trencavel 
  family, reclaimed Rhedae in the 12th century with the aid of the Count of Carcassone. 
  The King of Aragon claimed it in 1170, and sacked Rhedae, which was reduced 
  to the Trencavel citadel.</b></p>
<p><b>THE POLITICAL DISCORD may actually have aided another development occurring 
  simultaneously. A new religion was growing in Languedoc in those anarchistic 
  centuries. THE FIRST RECOGNIZABLE PERFECTI, OR CATHARS, appeared in Lyon and 
  Provence in 1002, during the reign of Pope Sylvester II. By the middle of the 
  12th century, the Cathars were close to being the majority religion in Languedoc. 
  Although there is doctrinal similarity between THE BOGOMILS and other Manichean 
  sects and the Cathars, their origins seem to be in the local traditions of Languedoc. 
  From our discussion above, it easy to see the Cathars as an extension of a much 
  older tradition in the region. </b></p>
<p><b>Whatever their origins, by the turn of the 13th century, the Cathars were 
  seen as a major challenge to the authority of the Roman Church. In 1208, Pope 
  Innocent III launched a Crusade against the heretics in Languedoc. Simon de 
  Montfort captured Beziers and Carcassone, was proclaimed Count of Carcassone 
  and the Razes, and then turned his attention to subduing his new County. Rhedae 
  was destroyed and the area fell under Simon's direct control until his death 
  at the siege of Toulouse in 1218. The title was then assumed by one of his Lieutenants, 
  Pierre de Voison.</b></p>
<p><b>Recovery from the Cathar Crusade was slow, marred by attacks from brigands 
  and devastated by the Black Death. The city of Rhedae disappeared forever. In 
  the 15th century, the current village of Rennes-le-Chateau grew up around the 
  Chateau of the Voisons and the church of the Magdalene. The Voisons died out 
  and the holding passed to a daughter and her husband, Pierre Raymond d'Hautpoul. 
  They restored the Blanchefort name, as Pierre was a cousin of the Trencavels. 
  The last of the second Blancheforts married Marie de Negre Dables in 1732, and 
  died without male heir in 1762. Marie died in the old chateau at Rennes on January 
  17th, 1781.</b></p>
<p><b>And there the story might have ended, except for THE CURIOUS PIETY OF MARIE 
  de BLANCHEFORT. As she had no sons, Marie chose to confess the family secret 
  to her parish priest, Abbe Bigou of Saint Magdalene's. From his choices would 
  grow the rest of the story.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Twelve</b></p>
<p><b>The Abbe Antoine Bigou is himself one of the mysteries of Rennes-le-Chateau. 
  Appointed to the village in 1774, his history and background have been obscured 
  by his times, the French Revolution, and his supposed importance in the later 
  development of the mystery. And yet, as we look closer at the facts, we find 
  that almost nothing can be confirmed. Abbe Bigou may have learned a secret from 
  Marie de Blanchefort, but there is no evidence he created the clues, including 
  Marie's tombstone, later attributed to him.</b></p>
<p><b>But we do have some convincing evidence that Marie de Negre de Blanchefort 
  had something interesting to pass on. Her husband's great grandfather, Pierre 
  d'Hautpol who inherited the Chateau and reclaimed the Blanchefort name, left 
  a will which contained several ancient documents related to his family's origins. 
  In the last year of Marie's life, she was focused on regaining these papers, 
  which she did a few months before her death. Could this be the genealogies found 
  by Sauniere?</b></p>
<p><b>Other than this single tangible, and tantalizing, piece of evidence the 
  rest of the story is based on rumors, speculation and hearsay. In exile during 
  the French Revolution, the Abbe Bigou apparently told another priest, the Abbe 
  Cauneille, about his &quot;great secret.&quot; He in turn told two other priests 
  in the area, the Abbe Jean Vie, of Rennes-le-Bains and the Abbe Emile Francois 
  Cayron, of St. Laurent de la Cabreriesse. One of them, the Abbe Vie, told his 
  successor, the Abbe Henri Boudet. Abbe Boudet seems to been have a major influence 
  behind Sauniere. </b></p>
<p><b>However, the modern version of the story is the work of Gerard de Sede, 
  a French researcher who talked to several surviving contemporaries of Boudet 
  and Sauniere in the early 1960's. One, the Abbe Maurice-Rene Mazieres, is the 
  end source for the information outlined above. Assuming that this chain of transmission 
  is basically correct, then the existence of the secret was known by a small 
  core of local priests through the 19th century. Sauniere knew what he was looking 
  for, given certain parameters. The only question is: Was he surprised by what 
  he found?</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Thirteen</b></p>
<p><b>What did the Grand Dame of the village relate to her personal chaplain before 
  she died? What did she tell him about the secrets contained in those hard-won 
  genealogies? Why did he wait ten years, until the eve of the Revolution, to 
  encode the secret on her tombstone and hide the papers in the altar pillars? 
  And what did he really tell the Abbe Caunielle before he died in Spain?</b></p>
<p><b>We have of course no answers to any of these questions. All anyone can do 
  is speculate from the available evidence. Examining the history of the region, 
  we find enough mysterious treasures to make even Sinbad jaded with their extravagance. 
  Merely to list them is to make one's head swim. </b></p>
<p><b>There's the treasure of the Volcae, the Celtic High-Kings, and the treasure 
  of lost Glanum. Then there's the Visigothic horde INCLUDING THE TREASURES OF 
  THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM. There's also the Merovingian treasure hidden by Dagobert 
  II, the loot of Guillem de Gellone AND THE CROWN OF THE JEWISH KING Arthur, 
  King Ursus, Sigisbert VI Count of Rhedae. And, last but not least, the lost 
  treasure of the Cathars and the Templars.</b></p>
<p><b>When we also add to the mix the strange permutations on a mysterious bloodline, 
  whether Arthurian, Jewish/Christian or both, THE IDEA OF A SECRET TREASURE BECOMES 
  EVEN MORE COMPLEX. Rightful owners and usurpers combine in a tangle of conflicting 
  claims. However, as Nostradamus reminds us, THIS TREASURE SEEMS TO HAVE SOME 
  SORT OF CURSE ATTACHED TO IT.</b></p>
<p><b>Originally taken from the sacred well in Toulouse by Consul Caepio, who 
  came to a bad end on the road to Marseilles, the treasure was possibly re-hidden 
  in THE ANCIENT MEGALITHIS PENTAGONAL TEMPLE of which Rennes-le-Chateau is a 
  part. The treasures of Glanum and the Visigoths added to the horde, which became 
  the key to THE MEROVINGIAN POWER STRUGGLES. Later it was used to leverage a 
  Kingdom against the Carolingian power. Given the success of Theodoric and Guillem 
  de Gellone, and the failure of Sigisbert VI, King Ursus, WE CAN SEE THE CURSE 
  AT WORK. Perhaps King Ursus financed his attempt at the throne of France with 
  part of the sacred treasure. His defeat and exile would suggest some such over-reaching, 
  even if only political.</b></p>
<p><b>It is also possible that the legends of the vast Merovingian treasure played 
  a part in the Cathar Crusades of the early 13th century. The main effort of 
  the first wave of Crusaders was to install Simon de Montfort as Count of Carcassone, 
  Beziers and Razes. In other words, the entire region around Rennes-le-Chateau. 
  De Montfort destroyed the ancient fortress at Rhedae and most of the surrounding 
  region. His actions were more of a conqueror in such of loot than any serious 
  attempt at rulership. </b></p>
<p><b>Indeed, de Montfort's stated design was to virtually annihilate the aristocracy 
  of the Languedoc and replace them with nobility from the north. Control of the 
  land was the goal, that and the extinction of the ancient ruling families of 
  the district. Eventually this would turn the Crusade against heretics into a 
  war to perpetuate de Monfort's conquests., if that had not been the original 
  object. What was it in Languedoc that Simon was so desperate to control?</b></p>
<p><b>Whatever it was, its possession made de Montfort a most unusual and powerful 
  man. In January 1215, The Council of Montpellier deposed the Count of Toulouse, 
  Raymond VI, and conferred on Simon de Montfort the unique title of Dominus et 
  Monarcha, or Lord And Ruler, implying some sense of feudal obligation to the 
  Pope himself. This was reinforced later that year at the Fourth Lateran Council 
  held in Rome. In spite of a spirited defense by Raymond-Roger, Count of Foix, 
  the Council confirmed de Montfort's right to rule. The King of France, on April 
  10, 1216 in a decree issued from Melun, invested de Montfort as the Count of 
  Toulouse, Carcassone, Beziers and the Razes.</b></p>
<p><b>However, at the very moment of his triumph, de Monfort's downfall was already 
  in the wings. The genesis of that downfall points to the secret of the treasure 
  and its curse. Like the Consul Caepio, the later day Roman de Montfort seems 
  to have fallen afoul of the Volcae gold.</b></p>
<p><b>In 1211, de Montfort captured the castle of Montferrand, just a few miles 
  across the valley from Rennes-le-Chateau. The castle was defended by Baldwin, 
  the younger brother of Count Raymond of Toulouse. As was common at that point 
  in the struggle, Baldwin switched sides after his capture. However Baldwin's 
  conversion was sincere, and he became one of de Monfort's chief supporters.</b></p>
<p><b>Meanwhile, The Count of Toulouse had gained a powerful ally, Peter II of 
  Aragon. In September, 1213, de Monfort went out to meet the forces of Aragon 
  and Toulouse at Muret, just east of Toulouse. De Montfort used a small tactical 
  squad of knights whose goal was the death of the King of Aragon. Either through 
  devilish unchivalry or divine intervention, de Montfort's knights KILLED Peter 
  II and the battle collapsed into a massacre. De Montfort won a great victory, 
  that for a time made him the undisputed ruler of the region. HE HAD WON, OR 
  SO IT SEEMED.</b></p>
<p><b>Baldwin of Toulouse had little to do with the great deeds of the battle 
  of Muret. He does not seem to have been there. However, he may have already 
  performed his greatest service to the de Monfort cause. The winter of 1212-13 
  saw the nadir of de Montfort's fortunes. He was reduced to a few hundred knights 
  and the Pope was writing letters with vague rumbling threats. By Easter, 1213, 
  all of this had changed. </b></p>
<p><b>Suddenly there was money to hire mercenaries, the core of those tactical 
  squads that would kill King Peter II, and the morale of the Crusaders became 
  such that by early summer there was an influx of pilgrims and northern knights 
  that enlarged de Montfort's forces. His miraculous victory that September silenced 
  his critics and preparations began for the Church Councils that would eventually 
  confirm his authority. The Pope, willing or not, no longer had any choice but 
  to support de Montfort.</b></p>
<p><b>Perhaps de Montfort persuaded Baldwin, who as the local commander and a 
  member of the ruling family would have known of the treasure and its secrets, 
  to reveal it to him in return for some future favors. Baldwin did receive several 
  principalities from de Montfort, and in 1214, on his way home from receiving 
  one of these fiefdoms, Baldwin was captured and turned over to his brother and 
  the Count of Foix. </b></p>
<p><b>Baldwin was treated very harshly, far beyond the usual reception of those 
  who merely changed sides in the conflict. Baldwin was hanged, ceremonially, 
  as a traitor to something larger than just the family. We can only suppose that 
  the larger something was the secret itself. Baldwin had betrayed the very heart 
  of Languedoc and given its treasure to the latest Roman. For that he died an 
  unpleasant death, the first of many to come.</b></p>
<p><b>Three years after the miraculous upturn, Simon was invested as ruler of 
  the conquered region by the Pope and the French King. If he could have held 
  his kingdom together, its power along with the secret, would have made de Montfort 
  a formidable player in medieval power politics. He could have formed a new western 
  Holy Roman Empire BEHOLDEN DIRECTLY TO THE POPE, one that could in fact have 
  replaced the crumbling power of the Hohenstauffens, the current Holy Roman Emperors. 
  But, within months of receiving the royal authority, it had all turned to ashes.</b></p>
<p><b>On his return from his investiture, de Montfort had to force his way into 
  his capital of Toulouse. He fell into a dispute with one of the mainstays of 
  the Crusade, the Bishop of Narbonne, and was caught by surprise when the young 
  Count Raymond VII moved out of Provence with an army as the old Count re-occupied 
  Toulouse. De Montfort charged off to besiege Toulouse where he died, beheaded 
  by an artillery stone, on June 25th 1218. De Montfort seems to have had some 
  prevision of his death, HE WAS PRAYING immediately before he went out to the 
  attack, and perhaps the secret was heavy on his soul. His death and defeat, 
  while it did not end the war, did suggest that de Montfort had somehow transgressed 
  against divine authority.</b></p>
<p><b>It is possible that this sense of transgression may have colored how Pierre 
  de Voison, de Montfort's lieutenant, perceived his inheritance, which in all 
  probability, contained the secret. The aura of the curse may have lingered all 
  the way down to the secrets Marie de Blanchefort told the Abbe Bigou. Perhaps 
  that's why she felt compelled to pass the story along when she died. She may 
  have felt that it was important to preserve the secret in order to contain the 
  curse.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Fourteen</b></p>
<p><b>To understand what seems to have happened next, we must attempt to enter 
  the mind of the Abbe Bigou. From the little we know of him, we can speculate 
  that he was reasonably well educated and, since he had been chaplain for seven 
  years, he would have been familiar with the history of the region. Therefore, 
  it must have been quite a shock when the Grand Dame of the village, and possibly 
  the Abbe's friend, revealed on her death bed the existence of a secret and a 
  treasure with the curse of Simon de Montfort on it. The Abbe, from that alone, 
  would have been shocked to his core.</b></p>
<p><b>But there was more, those genealogies that Marie de Blanchefort had struggled 
  to retrieve before she died. If she gave them to the Abbe, did she explain what 
  they meant? And how did the cursed treasure related to them? Was it a matter 
  OF WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO THE TREASURE? In that case, with the death of Marie 
  de Blanchefort who did have the right? THE ABBE BIGOU WAS LEFT WITH AN OVERWHELMING 
  PROBLEM.</b></p>
<p><b>A decade went by before the Abbe solved his problem. However, in that decade, 
  the very fabric of French society underwent a traumatic change. We have no way 
  of knowing how involved the Abbe Bigou was in those changes. The research is 
  lacking, but given what he appears to have done in 1791, shortly before he emigrated 
  to Spain, the Abbe must have been in contact with one or more occult groups 
  or secret societies of the time. To see this, we must look briefly at the two 
  pieces of evidence for which the Abbe was most probably responsible.</b></p>
<p><b>The story goes that around 1791, the Abbe Bigou had two strange tombstones 
  placed over the grave of Marie de Blanchefort in the Rennes-le-Chateau cemetery. 
  They were later defaced by Sauniere, although copies of them survived in local 
  antiquarian literature. The most authentic of the pair is the headstone, a pointed 
  slab with its conventional mortuary inscription curiously riddled with oddities.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>At first glance, it reads: &quot;Here lies the Noble Marie de Negre D'Arles 
  Dame D'Haupol de Blanchefort, aged sixty seven years, died the 17th of January, 
  1781. May she rest in peace.&quot; Almost every line on the stone has some kind 
  of oddity. One of them is the &quot;D'Arles&quot; of the name. It should be 
  &quot;D'Ables,&quot; but we might perhaps see the reference to Arles as significant 
  in itself. We find when we pull out the odd letters, that they spell out &quot;Mort 
  Epee,&quot; or Death Sword in French. The odd zero in the Roman numeral of the 
  date suggests that it should be read as 1681, a thousand years after Sigisbert 
  IV became Count of Rhedae. There is also the missing T in Hautpol and the curious 
  division of the last phrase. The T is perhaps the cross, or tau, at the center 
  of the mystery, and the division of &quot;Requiescat in Pace&quot; into &quot;Requies 
  Catin Pace&quot; emphasizes the French word &quot;catin&quot; or whore which 
  points again to the Magdalene. If the Abbe Bigou left us anything, it is likely 
  to be this tombstone. But what is it telling us? </b></p>
<p><b>We have clues:</b></p>
<p><b>1) The MORT epee, or sword of death suggests the whole tradition of mythical 
  swords, from Arthur to Roland. It could also be the key word in another cryptogram 
  or cypher.</b></p>
<p><b>2) We have a date of 1681, a hundred years before Marie de Blanchefort's 
  death. This date puts us in the reign of Louis XIV, the Sun King, and specifically 
  the time period of the Affair of the Poisons.</b></p>
<p><b>3) The missing T points to a hidden cross or tau.</b></p>
<p><b>4) The D'Arles/Dables switch points us back to Provence and Arles, with 
  its Grail connections in particular.</b></p>
<p><b>5) The catin or whore reference points to a connection with Mary Magdalene.</b></p>
<p><b>The story of the gravestone is even more curious. Supposedly it was done 
  at the same time as the headstone, but its strange inscription suggests the 
  involvement of some sort of secret society. Whether this was the result of the 
  Abbe's lost decade and any occult contacts he may have made is unknown. It is 
  unlikely that, if the Abbe Bigou actually created the flagstone, he used these 
  symbols on his own authority. Even more curious, this was also defaced by Sauniere, 
  and no solid authority exists as to its contents. Several version have been 
  put forward, including one from a book that apparently doesn't exist, so we 
  must take care in putting too much weight on any single interpretation.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Apparently the grave stone was inscribed with two lines of Greek letters 
  on either side of a central Latin inscription. The Latin inscription is divided 
  by a double-headed arrow which connects a PS in a curious loop at the top with 
  &quot;Prae-Cum&quot; and a spider at the bottom. The Greek letters are meaningless, 
  until we transpose them into their Latin equivalents. Then they spell out &quot;Et 
  In Arcadia Ego,&quot; a code phrase that goes all the way back to King Rene. 
  The central Latin inscription is very ambiguous, both in its lack of grammar 
  and its split placement, allowing us to read it horizontally, vertically and, 
  as we will see, radically.</b></p>
<p><b>The words are, from upper left going clockwise, Reddis, Regis, Arcis, Cellis. 
  Assuming that Reddis is Rhedae, then the simplest reading is Rhedae: Royal Fortress 
  Store-house. This is also, vertically, Rhedae Store-house, Royal Fortress. But 
  something still seems missing. However the PS and the Prae-cum spider may help 
  add to our understanding. If we think of prae-cum as the Latin before-with, 
  and connect that with the PS at the top, another message, which completes the 
  central inscription, appears.</b></p>
<p><b>The PS is enclosed in a loop that goes from before the P to before the S. 
  If we think of this as the &quot;before&quot; of the prae below, then we should 
  look for the letters before P and S. They are O and R, Or, the French word for 
  gold. If we then connect the spider cum or with the PS/OR, we come up with a 
  clever Green Language pun. Spider in French is araignee, which is pronounced 
  just like &quot;A Rennes,&quot; or &quot;at Rennes.&quot; The message then becomes: 
  &quot;Gold at Rennes, Royal Rhedae the Fortress Store-house: Et in Arcadia ego. 
  . .&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>The grave stone has other clues. There are eight Greek letters on each side 
  of the central inscription, and 22 letters in the central inscription itself. 
  The PS/Prae-Cum is written in eight letters, FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF 46. </b></p>
<p><b>FORTY SIX is an auspicious number. In esoteric Freemasonry, a 33 degree 
  Master has the opportunity to advance further by taking 13 extra grades or degrees. 
  Therefore A 46th DEGREE INITIATE IS SUPPOSEDLY A MASTER OF SPACE AND TIME, a 
  boddhisattva-like enlightened adept. A hint of this can also be gleaned from 
  the fact that 3 times 46 is 138, the number of the phrase BEN ELOHIM, or &quot;SONS 
  OF GOD.&quot; Other interesting ramifications of the number 46 include the number 
  of the name of Adam, the first man. It is also said that it took 46 years to 
  build King Solomon's Temple. Each human being has 46 chromosomes. Forty six 
  equals the name of God, Elhi, an ancient name for the El in the Sky, the High 
  God of Draco. It is also the number of the Levite priests who ministered to 
  that God. </b></p>
<p><b>We might think then that the gravestone is the work of a 46th degree initiate 
  in some kind of secret society. Another clue in the central inscription suggests 
  which variety. If we take the letters of the central inscription and align them 
  in a cross with their mutual S at the center, then we find four groups of four 
  letters each and a fifth group of two letters. These are RC, pointing in a covert 
  or occult way to the Rosicrucians. Reading the S as a moebius strip connection, 
  the central S and the four I's around it can be read as ISIS/ISIS. The inscription 
  can now be read as: ISIS - R(ose) C(ross) - She who rules The Arc - ISIS.</b></p>
<p><b>Therefore, the gravestone gives us ample evidence of the hand of a secret 
  society at work in the mystery. When we put the two messages together, one thing 
  becomes apparent. The headstone points to a mystery, the gravestone attempts 
  to claim that mystery.</b></p>
<p><b>Whatever Abbe Bigou learned, it would sooner or later become the property 
  of a secret organization. It is doubtful that Bigou was a member of such a society, 
  but without question it was the Abbe Bigou who brought it to their attention. 
  Only a group with deep esoteric ties could have placed a tombstone such as Marie 
  de Blanchefort's in Rennes' cemetery. </b></p>
<p><b>The rest of the secret, the genealogies for instance, disappeared, hidden 
  in all likelihood by the Abbe Bigou when the French Revolution prevented the 
  secret society that probably placed the tombstone from receiving them. They 
  remained hidden until the Abbe Berenger Sauniere decided to renovate the church 
  of the Magdalene in the late 1880's.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Fifteen</b></p>
<p><b>Berenger SAUNIERE was born on April 11, 1852 in the small village of Montazels 
  across the valley from Rennes-le-Chateau. The oldest of seven children, he was 
  22 when he entered the Seminary in 1874. Ordained in 1879, he was posted first 
  to Alet, and then to Clat, before arriving at Rennes-le-Chateau in June of 1885. 
  We might suppose it was a case of local boy makes good, and from the very beginning 
  Sauniere acted as if he had a mission. During the heated parliamentary elections 
  of 1885, Sauniere preached two inflammatory anti-Republican sermons and was 
  removed for a while to the seminary in Narbonne as punishment. His sudden plunge 
  into politics foreshadowed the rest of his career. If Sauniere had any enemies 
  at that point, they were within the church.</b></p>
<p><b>Within a year he was back at his post in Rennes-le Chateau, now covered 
  with monarchical glory. Sauniere received generous support for his proposed 
  reconstruction efforts from many local royalists. In the spring of 1887, support 
  of a most surprising kind arrived, in the form of an emissary supposedly from 
  the widow of the French Pretender, Henri de Bourbon, or, in his own eyes at 
  least, Henry V of France.</b></p>
<p><b>Henry had died in 1885, and with him went all hope of a Bourbon restoration. 
  His wife, the Comtesse de Chambord, was trying by any means necessary to reinforce 
  her children's precarious position. Sauniere, as an ardent monarchist, would 
  have agreed with the Comtesse's desires, but even he must have surprised by 
  what the emissary offered. Three thousand francs, a fortune to a poor parish 
  priest, for the restoration of the church, if only he would look for something 
  hidden by one of his predecessors, the Abbe Bigou. It is unlikely that the emissary 
  told him exactly what they hoped to find, but it is likely that the idea of 
  genealogical records, perhaps related to the survival of Louis XVII who supposedly 
  escaped from the Temple in 1791, were mentioned.</b></p>
<p><b>Sauniere took the money, and began his search. His first step may been to 
  make the acquaintance of another local priest, the Abbe Henri Boudet. We know 
  that they became friends around this time, and we have no evidence that they 
  knew each other before the visit by the Comtesse's emissary. However, after 
  Sauniere began his quest, they became deeply entwined with each other and the 
  secret itself.</b></p>
<p><b>The Abbe Henri Jean-Jacques Boudet was a generation older than Sauniere, 
  born in 1837 at Quillan. He was ordained in 1861 and by 1872 had become the 
  parish priest of Rennes-le-Bains, a neighboring village which was the site of 
  several ancient structures, including a Roman hot springs bath. His predecessor 
  at Rennes-le-Bains was the Abbe Jean Vie, one of the two priests to whom Abbe 
  Caunielle entrusted the Abbe Bigou's secret. The core of the secret passed, 
  either directly or indirectly, to the Abbe Boudet.</b></p>
<p><b>For eight years after his appointment, Boudet worked on the secret from 
  the clues that the Abbe Vie had passed on to him. By 1880, he had completed 
  the manuscript of a vast masterwork entitled THE TRUE CELTIC LANGUAGE and the 
  Megaliths of Rennes-le-Bains. It took six more years before the work was published, 
  at the Abbe's expense, and then it was roundly criticized as being &quot;a fantastical 
  and indescribable work.&quot; The Abbe himself tells us early on in the book 
  that it is written in a kind of Green Language code. &quot;Speaking a certain 
  jargon from outside,&quot; as Boudet calls it, which suggests the alchemist 
  Fulcanelli's description of the Green Language as the argot or cant of the outsiders, 
  in his Mystery of the Cathedrals, another book pronounced as unreadable by those 
  who haven't read it..</b></p>
<p><b>But, by the time the Comtesse's emissary arrived, the Abbe's book had circulated 
  in some very interesting circles. He sent 100 copies to various &quot;interested 
  persons,&quot; such as heads of states, kings, political figures and so on. 
  One of those copies found its way, no doubt, into the hands of the Comtesse 
  or some one in her circle. However, the book itself is totally obscure without 
  a key. The fact that the Comtesse responded at all is oblique proof that the 
  Abbe Bigou had related at least part of the secret to some kind of royalist 
  secret society just before the French Revolution. The question of why didn't 
  they contact Boudet directly may be answered by reflecting on the fact that 
  Boudet may have already known too much. Sauniere however, might have been fooled 
  initially by the Louis XVII smoke screen.</b></p>
<p><b>And so he began his restoration work. In front of the main altar, supported 
  on an ancient stone pillar engraved with the Visigothic Cross of Silence, Sauniere 
  made his first discovery. The story is that as the altar pillar was moved, it 
  slipped and cracked both itself and the flagstone on which it fell. The flagstone, 
  when turned over, revealed an ancient Merovingian design on its face and the 
  entrance to a vault or crypt. Apparently, there was also some sort of gold cache 
  as well, for the rumors started almost immediately. In a village the size of 
  Rennes-le-Chateau, roughly two hundred people at this point, nothing could be 
  kept truly secret.</b></p>
<p><b>Work halted while Sauniere explored the discovery. In addition to the vault 
  and its curious stone, Sauniere also found a wooden tube filled with parchments 
  in the hollow base of the Visigothic pillar. After a few months, Sauniere moved 
  the Merovingian stone to the cemetery and closed the vault back up. He also 
  seems to have conferred with the Abbe Boudet over the parchments he found. He 
  does not seem to have directly notified the Comtesse of his discovery.</b></p>
<p><b>We should also note that the famed wealth of Sauniere had yet to arrive. 
  Other than the generous donations for the restoration work, which all seems 
  to have been spent on the church, Sauniere was still living the life of a simple 
  parish priest. The Comtesse's 3,000 francs are accounted for in the new altar 
  and stained glass of the church, and very little else in the way of restoration 
  was done for four years. In that time, Sauniere was busy with other matters, 
  including a long stay at Antugnac near his home village of Montazels. </b></p>
<p><b>All was quiet until the summer of 1891, when the pieces of the puzzle apparently 
  came together in a major discovery. From that point on, Sauniere lived and acted 
  as a wealthy man. One who was also beyond the censure of the church. In fact, 
  after 1891, Sauniere acted as if he were the rightful owner of the secret. Perhaps, 
  during his stay in Antugnac, Sauniere added his own branch to the family tree 
  found in the Visigothic pillar. However, all we can say for sure is that by 
  the summer of 1891, things had changed, and they would never be the same agaim. 
  </b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Sixteen</b></p>
<p><b>To understand what happened at Rennes-le-Chateau between 1887 and 1891, 
  we must step back and look at one of Europe's oldest dynasties, THE HAPSBURGS. 
  The historical origin of the Hapsburg family goes back to the 10th century and 
  the intrigues of Otto I, the first Hohenstauffen to become Emperor of Charlemagne's 
  revived Holy Roman Empire. At that point the empire consisted of little more 
  than a collection of Germanic states. In 1273, Rudolph of Hapsburg -- a loose 
  conglomeration of family holdings in Alsace, Swabia and the Black Forest -- 
  was chosen to be the new Emperor. His most important action was to drive the 
  King of Bohemia out of the Ostmark, or eastern regions, of Charlemagne's Empire, 
  WHICH INCLUDED THE FORTRESS CITY OF VIENNA. As Emperor, Rudolph made over the 
  city and region around it, Austria or the eastern land, to members of his family. 
  In that way the House of Hapsburg became the House of Austria.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg357.gif" width="542" height="695"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ImperialCity.gif" width="648" height="834"></p>
<p><b>For most of the six hundred years between Rudolph of Hapsburg and Crown 
  Prince Rudolph, the history of Europe really was the history of the Hapsburg. 
  Alone of all the dynasties of Europe, the Hapsburgs were not bound to a certain 
  homeland from which they ruled. Indeed, the Hapsburgs grew to rule much of Europe 
  through family connections, and their right to be rulers rested on their bloodline. 
  The Hapsburgs were important for who they were, as much or more than for what 
  they owned. However, the origin of this right to rule is obscure.</b></p>
<p><b>Many genealogies were compiled through the centuries by court appointed 
  researchers who traced the origin of the Hapsburgs BACK TO SUCH ANCIENT LUMINARIES 
  AS JULIUS CAESAR AND PRIAM OF TROY. A more likely lineage goes back to the Merovingian 
  heartland of Austrasia. The anarchy in Austrasia after Dagobert II's murder 
  was probably the moment when the Hapsburgs first emerged on the stage of history. 
  They survived the Carolingian era by supporting the stronger side, just as they 
  later supported the Hohenstauffens. IN THE SLOW GROWTH OF HAPSBURG POWER, THERE 
  IS A SENSE, SOMEHOW, OF AN EVIL MENACE WAITING IN THE WINGS.</b></p>
<p><b>Once the Hapsburg gained control of the Holy Roman Empire, they remained 
  in control until its dissolution BY NAPOLEON in 1806. The Treaty of Vienna in 
  1818 created the Dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary, which was the Old Empire 
  in all but name, and without its German and Italian provinces. As revolution 
  swept through Europe in 1848, the Archduke Franz Joseph became Emperor of Austria-Hungary. 
  He would rule for 68 years, and in the end would die before his beloved Empire. 
  IT WOULD NOT LONG SUCCEED HIM.</b></p>
<p><b>But in the mid 1880's, this was in the future and the Hapsburgs of Austria-Hungary 
  were the most powerful ruling family in Europe. They enter the story of Rennes-le-Chateau 
  with the arrival of the emissary, supposedly sent on behalf of the Comtesse 
  de Chambord, the former Marie de Hapsburg-Lorraine, daughter of Leopold II, 
  Archduke of Tuscany and the Piedmont of Italy, and widow of the Pretender, Henry 
  V of France. Her titles and family connections are important, because it is 
  likely that her supposed emissary was her youngest brother, Johann Salvator 
  de Hapsburg-Lorraine. It is also likely that the Comtesse had nothing to do 
  with it, beside providing a convenient cover story. </b></p>
<p><b>The Abbe Boudet sent his book to all the ruling families of Europe including 
  the Hapsburgs, and given their history, the Hapsburg-Lorraines in particular. 
  Descended from King Rene's grandson and his marriage to a Hapsburg princess 
  in the late 15th century, the Hapsburg-Lorraines have often been called the 
  Latinized Hapsburgs. Their long reign in northern Italy and Provence seems to 
  have inspired these Hapsburgs with something lacking in their Austrian cousins. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>However, by the middle of the 19th century, the Grand Dukes of Tuscany had 
  fallen on hard times. Leopold II, Marie and Johann's father, backed his cousin 
  the Emperor Franz Joseph in the struggles for Italian independence. After the 
  Emperor's defeat at Soliferno in 1859, Leopold lost the Grand Duchy. It became 
  part of Victor Emmnauel's new Kingdom of Italy. Leopold's eldest son Ferdinand 
  renounced his claim to the throne, as did the middle brother Ludwig, who became 
  a locksmith. Johann, the youngest, became the last hope of the family for greatness. 
  It was a role that, subsequent history would suggest, he wore with some reluctance.</b></p>
<p><b>By 1887, Johann had already come into conflict with his cousin, the Emperor 
  Franz Joseph, and ended any hope of advancement within the House of Hapsburg. 
  Johann was a renegade archduke, a man with ambitions, a divine sense of authority, 
  and no way to express his talents and abilities. He was friends with liberals, 
  free thinkers, and his Christianity was in doubt, A SERIOUS QUESTION IN CATHOLIC 
  VIENNA. He was known to have joined several chivalric secret orders, such as 
  the Knights of the Rosy-Cross and the Order of the Crescent founded by his ancestor, 
  King Rene, in which he was the hereditary Grand Master. Given his background 
  and interests, it would be surprising if Boudet's book had not reached him.</b></p>
<p><b>And so, in the spring of 1887, Archduke Johann paid a visit to the Abbe 
  Sauniere under the guise of an emissary from his sister, Marie de Chambord, 
  with a plausible cover story for looking for the Abbe Bigou's hidden genealogies. 
  After Sauniere made his initial discovery, he did not try to contact the Comtesse, 
  but he was in close contact with Archduke Johann. In the fall of 1887, bank 
  accounts were opened on the same day in the same Austrian bank by both Johann 
  and the Abbe Sauniere. Transactions between these two accounts would continue 
  for years, even after Johann's disappearance. They would later form the basis 
  of an accusation of spying leveled against Sauniere.</b></p>
<p><b>From the fall of 1887 to the summer of 1889, Johann seems to have been a 
  frequent visitor to Rennes-le-Chateau. To the locals, he became the Stranger, 
  and was remembered long afterward as Monsieur Guillame. During those visits, 
  the three co-conspirators, Sauniere, Johann and Boudet, unraveled the mystery. 
  It revealed a discovery so powerful that the Archduke Johann took it to his 
  cousin, the Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria-Hungary, AND THEREBY SET OFF A TRAIN 
  OF EVENTS THAT LED, INEXORABLY, TO THE CATACLYSM OF WORLD WAR I.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Seventeen</b></p>
<p><b>Let us imagine that it is a gloomy fall afternoon in 1887. The renovations 
  to the Church of the Magdalene have halted since the summer, but we may reasonably 
  suppose it had been cleared enough to be serviceable to its small congregation. 
  On this afternoon, let us imagine that three men are bending over several unrolled 
  parchments spread on a board table in the chancel of the church, near where 
  the altar pillar once stood.</b></p>
<p><b>Two of the men are close to the same age. The tall, blond and aristocratically 
  correct Johann contrasts sharply with the short, barrel chested Languedocian 
  dynamo of his contemporary, the Abbe Sauniere. It is Sauniere's enthusiasm for 
  &quot;buried treasure&quot; that has brought them this far. However, it is the 
  third member of the trio who has undoubtedly made the most profound contribution. 
  Fourteen years older, the quiet and reserved Abbe Boudet is the authority on 
  the subject.</b></p>
<p><b>Since we are looking through the window of our imagination, let us also 
  observe the entrance of a shy and sensitive 19 year old village girl, Marie 
  Denaraud. She asks if anyone needs anything, tea, a cold sandwich, a nip of 
  something stronger to cut through the chill in the church, perhaps? They smile, 
  as she is quite lovely in an innocent and unspoiled way, and she is pleased 
  and flattered that she is taking care of such serious and important people. 
  Perhaps, as she returns with the brandy, she lingers and contributes to the 
  conversation. In our imagination let us suppose that it was Marie's knowledge 
  of local customs and ancient legends that finally solved the puzzle.</b></p>
<p><b>The conversation becomes heated, with Johann drawing geometric designs on 
  tracings of the ancient parchments. Boudet keeps shaking his head, none match 
  his piece of the puzzle. Why, Sauniere asks, why this strange five-sided geometry? 
  What could that have to do with anything?</b></p>
<p><b>And then, in our imagination, Marie responds with the story of the five 
  pointed star on the land, and the group falls silent as they mull it over. Marie 
  shows them on the map, and suddenly, everyone is talking at once. By morning, 
  the basic outlines of the mystery have been solved, and the intrepid trio sets 
  off to uncover the secret with Marie leading the way.</b></p>
<p><b>If it did not happen like that, it certainly should have. There is an unmistakably 
  aura of romance to the story, and if Hollywood ever does a version, we can be 
  sure it will happen just that way.</b></p>
<p align="center"><b> Part III - The Secret Emerges</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Eighteen</b></p>
<p><b>What clues did they have? What did they have to go on as they worked their 
  way through the puzzle?</b></p>
<p><b>They had Marie de Blanchefort's headstone, the crypt discovered under the 
  church, and they had the parchments Sauniere found in the Visigothic pillar. 
  Along with that, they had Boudet's knowledge derived third hand from Bigou, 
  and they had Johann's knowledge of esoteric subjects. Sauniere supplied the 
  motive force which kept everything in motion. </b></p>
<p><b>The parchments apparently consisted of two geneological tables, one relating 
  Pierre D'Hautpol to the Kings of Septimania, and the other relating those kings 
  to Sigisbert IV, and perhaps through his mother's side to the Holy Family. Certainly 
  his father's side was the main branch of the Merovingians. These geneologies 
  could be checked through the family records of the Hapsburgs, available by discreet 
  inquiry to Johann.</b></p>
<p><b>Along with the geneologies were two other parchments, each a badly botched 
  version of a passage from the New Testament. At first glance, it is not apparent 
  that whoever did the tombstone, also did these parchments. As we look closer 
  however, the mystery deepens.</b></p>
<p><b>Parchment One appears to be an inaccurately copied version of Jesus' parable 
  OF HARVESTING CORN ON THE SABBATH, a story which appears in all three synoptic 
  gospels (Luke 6:1-4, Matthew 12: 1-4 and Mark 2: 23-26) and has long been considered 
  a metaphor for spiritual alchemy. Other than the bad Latin of the version, which 
  follows the Gospels, there are three additional crosses in the text. At the 
  top is a triangle with an M above it and what looks like the letter I inside 
  of it. The lines which form the triangle extend beyond the corner on the right 
  side of the triangle. At the bottom are four extra words and PS. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Parchment One</b></p>
<p><b>The four words, &quot;Redis bles solis saceradotibus,&quot; can easily be 
  read in Latin and French as &quot;Rhedae &quot;corn&quot; only for the sacred 
  initiated.&quot; Corn in French is slang for gold, much as bread is slang for 
  money in America. Before we look any farther, -- it is perhaps the first thing 
  we read as we glance at the parchment -- we see the clear statement that Rhedae's 
  gold is only for the sacred initiates. This message however merely begins our 
  search for meaning. It is likely that's what it was intended to do.</b></p>

  HUNT ARK OF THE COVENANT<br>
  Relic searchers dig near Jesus' crucifixion site in quest for chest holding 
  10 Commandments</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Joe Kovacs<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For centuries, many have wondered 
    whatever happened to the Ark of the Covenant, the box the Bible says contained 
    the Ten Commandments of God. Now, a new quest is underway for the legendary 
    chest featured in the film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; trying to 
    prove the claim the Ark is buried below the purported site where Jesus Christ 
    was crucified. An international team has just completed what it calls its 
    first stage of exploration, spending two weeks beneath Mount Moriah outside 
    the walls of ancient Jerusalem. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 30 explorers from the U.S., 
    Australia, Norway and Estonia have been in a cave system north of the city's 
    Damascus Gate to try to determine if the Ark is indeed located there. The 
    group is trying to verify the claim made by relic hunter Ron Wyatt who said 
    he actually saw the Ark there two decades ago after tunneling through a small 
    passageway. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wyatt died of cancer in 1999 after 
    years of searching for biblical antiquities, claiming to have found Noah's 
    Ark near Mount Ararat in Turkey, the remains of Pharaoh's chariots that chased 
    Moses through the Red Sea, and the &quot;true&quot; location of Mount Sinai 
    in Arabia. &quot;I just want to know the truth, whatever it is,&quot; says 
    Richard Rives, president of Wyatt Archaeological Research in Cornersville, 
    Tenn., which is spearheading the latest effort. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While members of his group are 
    not archaeologists by trade &#150; they're doctors, nurses, structural and 
    construction engineers, and businessmen &#150; they are teaming with professional 
    archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority, which has sanctioned 
    the dig. In 1982, Wyatt entered the caves from a location since sealed, but 
    believed there was an alternate passageway used by the prophet Jeremiah to 
    protect the Ark from invading Babylonians some 600 years before the birth 
    of Christ. Ironically, during his Ark quest 21 years ago, Wyatt and his crew 
    decided to take a break and go to the movies. Unaware of what was playing, 
    they were surprised to see &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; which had

    ground-penetrating radar to peer below the surface, trying to pinpoint the 
    alleged tunnel of Jeremiah. Rives believes they met great success while taking 
    samples behind a man-made wall. David and Richard Rives at man-made wall that 
    could conceal passageway to Ark (wyattmuseum.com). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We found a void where Ron 
    said there would be a passageway,&quot; Rives said. It's at the end of that 
    passageway where Wyatt believed the sacred container rests. But once the diggers 
    started excavating beneath the wall, they encountered a problem forcing a 
    halt to the hunt. &quot;We lost our ceiling to prevent collapse,&quot; Rives 
    said. &quot;The people in the antiquities department insisted we stop and 
    do more architectural engineering to determine what it would take to continue 
    safely.&quot; The group is now studying the situation WITH EXPERTS and hopes 
    to be back in business within the next six months. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This latest search effort reignites 
    debate over whether or not the Ark is even located there, since many theories 
    have sprouted concerning the container's whereabouts. Some claim it's currently 
    in Ethiopia, having been brought there after a visit to Solomon's Temple by 
    the ancient Queen of Sheba. Others have suggested the box is hidden in Spain, 
    Canada, Elephantine Island in Egypt, the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm and 
    even somewhere in America near Utah. The Bible's final mention of the Ark 
    recounts King Josiah's order to return the chest to the temple: Put the Holy 
    Ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; 
    it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders. (2 Chronicles 35:3) Spiros Zodhiates, 
    editor of the Hebrew-Greek Key Word Study Bible, expounds on the Ark's possible 
    fae subsequent to that verse. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It may have been carried 
    away by [Babylonian King] Nebuchadnezzar along with the other saved articles, 
    when he plundered the temple,&quot; Zodhiates writes. &quot;Since no reference 
    is made to the Ark by Ezra, Nehemiah or even [Roman historian] Josephus after 
    the capitivity, it is believed that there was no Ark in the second temple 
    and that the Holy of Holies [where the Ark was situated in the temple] stood 
    empty.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Biblical scholar and modern-day 
    relic hunter Mike Sanders, who has gained notoriety with his Biblical Mysteries 
    programs, believes the original Ark was destroyed by a different pagan king, 
    and a replica was constructed to replace it. &quot;The Ark was certainly taken 
    by the Egyptian King Shishak,&quot; Sanders told WorldNetDaily. &quot;There 
    were obviously subsequent copies made as there were of all the other temple 
    accoutrements which were also looted many times over the centuries. This has 
    enabled the myth makers to come up with many wild and wonderful scenarios.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanders believes the Ark's contents 
    &#150; the stone tablets etched by God with the Ten Commandments &#150; are 
    located in the foundation deposit of an Egyptian temple he discovered in the 
    Judean hills. &quot;Hopefully we will extract the contents live on the Internet 
    and on television sometime early next year when the situation in Israel is 
    somewhat safer,&quot; he says. Sanders is among those critical of Wyatt's 
    assertions about the Ark. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When he was alive, I spent 
    some time asking him questions and asking for evidence [regarding] his claims. 
    None was ever forthcoming to me or anyone else,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;In 
    those areas where I have done some investigations, he has proven to be a charlatan.&quot; 
    Just days before his death, Wyatt granted an interview to WorldNetDaily, and 
    addressed such criticism from his detractors. &quot;There's nothing [that] 
    can be done to prevent ridicule that I'm aware of,&quot; Wyatt said. &quot;I 
    don't think it would be appropriate to deny people the opportunity of using 
    ridicule because I think that's part of showing their true character.&quot; 
    During the interview, Wyatt explained he found an earthquake crack directly 
    below the place where the wood on which Jesus was crucified would have been. 
    The cleft extends down through the rock to the resting place of the Mercy 
    Seat representing God's throne atop the Ark of the Covenant. The blood of 
    Christ would have flowed through that crevice after his death and after his 
    side had been pierced by a soldier's spear. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bible teaches the concept of 
    sacrifice of animals, symbolic of the actual blood sacrifice Christ would 
    make. The act of Christ, regarded by some as the great High Priest, permitting 
    himself to be sacrificed and placing his own blood upon the Mercy Seat was 
    the great and final act in the process of blood sacrifice, according to Wyatt's 
    writings. And while Wyatt believed the Ark itself would never be moved from 
    its current location, he thought the laws of God inside it would eventually 
    be removed and put on display as a testimony to the world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This last revelation is for 
    the inhabitants of the Earth who don't have a clue, as well as for those of 
    us who do have a clue and have been commissioned by Christ to reach out to 
    help bring these people who don't have a clue into the fold,&quot; Wyatt told 
    WorldNetDaily. &quot;So these are tools that God has given the believers to 
    strengthen their faith and to reach out with. They are tools that will be 
    extremely effective in these the last pouring out to the entire population, 
    all inhabitants of the Earth.&quot; Rives says from a biblical standpoint, 
    it makes perfect sense the Ark would be located where Wyatt claimed and be 
    covered with Christ's own blood. &quot;What's important about the Ark is what's 
    inside of it &#150; the Ten Commandments, the Covenant,&quot; said Rives. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While many people talk about sin 
    in the modern world, Rives points out the Bible defines sin as breaking the 
    law recorded on the tablets inside the Ark. &quot;For sin is the transgression 
    of the law.&quot; (1 John 3:4) &quot;The first four Commandments teach us 
    who our Creator is and how he wants us to worship Him,&quot; said Rives. &quot;There's 
    an adversary, Satan. He wants to be God if he can get us to break those first 
    four Commandments. Many aspects of religion today are in violation of the 
    first four Commandments.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)..</font><b>.In Nehemiah's 
  description of the re-building after the Babylonian exile (Nehemiah 3:16) we 
  find that David's Tomb was located on Mt. Zion. In Psalms, particularly number 
  2 which is probably by David himself and may even be the song he sang as he 
  danced in front of the Arc/Throne, Mt. Zion is God's &quot;holy hill&quot; where 
  he will judge the righteous and smite the wicked. Even more interesting is Psalm 
  48 which is a priestly invocation sung as a kind of circle casting before ritually 
  opening the temple, where we find the words &quot;in the city of our God, his 
  holy mountain.&quot; Also included is the only known cognate of Zion: Zaphon, 
  which unfortunately tells us little more than that it was an older form of Zion.</b></p>
<p><b>Isaiah cemented Mt. Zion's eschatological importance with verses such as 
  2:2-4, where the &quot;mountain of the Lord's temple&quot; becomes the center 
  of &quot;the last days&quot; and &quot;all nations will stream to it.&quot; 
  He also tells us that &quot;the law will go out from Zion&quot; which will bring 
  about the peace of nations. Ezekiel also went in trance to the spiritual Mt. 
  Zion where he witnessed the architecture of the Heavenly Temple in the New Jerusalem.</b></p>
<p><b>Obadiah 13; 17 - 21 repeats this eschatological meaning by declaring that 
  &quot;Mount Zion will be deliverance&quot; in the last days, the place where 
  enemies are judged and the faithful rewarded. Zechariah also mentions apocalyptic 
  events on Mt. Zion, Zechariah 6:1. After this, a strange silence fall on the 
  subject of Mt. Zion.</b></p>
<p><b>Jesus never refers, in the texts we have left, to Mt. Zion. Given its eschatological 
  and Davidic importance, this is truly odd. The closest he comes is a backhanded 
  reference to Isaiah 14:12-15 in Luke that seems to imply that he has committed 
  the impropriety of making himself like God and therefore must be punished. In 
  Isaiah, it is the &quot;morning star&quot; or Lucifer who ascends to Mt. &quot;Zaphon&quot; 
  or Zion and claims God's Throne. In Luke 10:18, Jesus identifies himself with 
  these verses.</b></p>
<p><b>Mt. Zion does appear in two places in the New Testament, the Letter to the 
  Hebrews and the Revelation of St. John. Hebrews is a strange letter once attributed 
  to Paul but long recognized as not by him. The best candidate is the Alexandrian 
  Jew Apollos, known to both Paul and Luke. He uses his letter, written before 
  the fall of the temple, to remind the Christians of Jerusalem of the original 
  eschatological significance of Melchizedek's convenant with Abraham and David's 
  kingly covenant. The author claims that Jesus re-established this covenant and 
  all believers would share in it WHEN THE TEMPLE ON MT. ZION IS BEEN MADE NEW 
  AGAIN</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> (Hebrews 12:22).</font></p>
<p><b>Revelations mentions Mt. Zion as the place where the Lamb and the 144,000 
  faithful will gather for the judgment. (Rev. 14:1) It also the location of the 
  New Jerusalem and the spot where the two Trees will stand in the remade heaven 
  and earth. </b></p>
<p><b>So, Mt. Zion is A) The place where Abraham sacrificed to the God Most High, 
  B) Original resting place of the Arc in Jerusalem and the place where God made 
  David King, C) David's Tomb, D) The Holy Eschatological Mountain, E) not mentioned 
  by Jesus, even in John's Gospel.</b></p>
<p><b>However, The Last Supper was held on Mt. Zion, in the upper room of a house 
  in the Essene quarter, which is just south of the old tower or fortress on the 
  top of Mt. Zion known as David's Tomb. This had to be chosen for a reason, probably 
  to match the clues in the ritual invocation of Psalm 48:2. That it occurred 
  on Mt. Zion has apocalyptic significance. </b></p>
<p><b>All of this would have known been to the group studying the parchments. 
  Given their education and esoteric background, it is possible that they also 
  knew OF ZION'S OCCULT SIGNIFICANCE. This can be revealed by a Kabbalistic technique 
  known as gematria, where each letter in the Hebrew alphabet is assigned a number, 
  and words with similar numbers are thought to have esoteric connections through 
  the juxtaposition of their meanings.</b></p>
<p><b>Since Zion is a word without known cognates, its meaning can only be revealed 
  by some sort of analogy. ZN is the root word in Hebrew and numerically it is 
  Z, zayin, 7 plus N, nun, 50, for a total of 57. In Hebrew, this is the number 
  of the words for consuming, terrible, subversion and making a secret. The original 
  &quot;Zaphon&quot; is another bizzare root word, ZPN, which adds up to 137, 
  the number of the word received, or kabalah, in Hebrew. The orginal meaning 
  was THE PLACE. OR STATE OF MIND WHERE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSE COULD BE 
  FOUND. Zion spelled in full also adds up to 137. Sion, its usage in the parchments, 
  can be spelled Samek Nun, which equals 110, or the end of days in Hebrew, an 
  indication of its apocalyptic significance. Spelled in full it adds up to 190, 
  which is also the number of the Hebrew word appointed time. </b></p>
<p><b>And so we have the eschatological mountain where covenants are made with 
  God, spelled so as to indicate its apocalyptic, appointed-time-of-the-end-of-days, 
  meaning. IT ALSO POINTS TO THE ANCIENT SCIENCE OF THE KABBALAH, and ultimately 
  to a Jewish origin for the mystery. This much the first parchment is telling 
  us virtually in the clear. Its next message is hidden only a little deeper.</b></p>
<p><b>As we read the text, we notice that there are odd breaks in words and some 
  letters raised above the line in a way that goes beyond sloppy calligraphy. 
  There are also THREE SMALL CROSSES inserted within the text. The prominent break 
  at the end of line two points up a raised A. If we follow this example and look 
  for the raised letters, we find that a clear message emerges. In French it reads: 
  &quot;A Dagobert II Roi et a Sion est ce tresor et il est la Mort.&quot;</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCrosses.gif" width="437" height="290"></p>
<p><b>In English this becomes &quot;To Dagobert II King and to Sion is the treasure 
  and it is there, Death.&quot; So, the parchment connects Sion and the lost Merovingian 
  Kings with some sort of treasure. The interesting point is the end of the French 
  phrase. With no punctuation, it is hard to tell whether it means &quot;he is 
  dead,&quot; or &quot;he is there dead.&quot; With the ambiguities, &quot;it 
  is there, death&quot; seems a more reasonable translation. However we read it, 
  there is a definite suggestion of a curse.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Nineteen</b></p>
<p><b>With the easy part behind them, and with some assurance that they were on 
  the right track, the next piece of the puzzle was a little more difficult. Its 
  decipherment led TO NOTHING LESS THAN THE STONE OF ZION AND THE HEART OF THE 
  MYSTERY.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/heavenlyyWorld-2.gif" width="574" height="768"></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>So far, the strange M and triangle in the upper left corner has played little 
  part in the puzzle. Yet, it must be significant. When we do as the image suggests 
  and extend the lines of the triangle through the text, we find a pattern forming. 
  The upper line of the triangle passed through the first cross in the text in 
  line 4. The lower line appears to hit nothing significant until it strikes the 
  final N in the bottom line. This N seems to be part of a pattern.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our code word, Sion, in the final four end lines of the text, is part of 
  that pattern. The last five letters of the text are SINON, with the central 
  N the terminus point of the lower triangle line. If we remove this letter, we 
  have of course another use of the key word, Sion. However, if we draw a line 
  from the terminus point of the upper line, the first cross, and the lower, the 
  N, we also spell out Sion with the letters the line passes through, for the 
  third use of the key word.</b></p>
<p><b>This is indeed curious. Three times 190, Sion spelled in full in Hebrew, 
  is 570, a factor of 57, ZN, or Zion, and the number of THE HEBREW WORD GATE 
  OR DOOR, AS IN THE GATE TO THE UNDERWORLD. Also the line from the N to the first 
  cross passes between two displaced O's, as if giving a hint of sighting or aligning 
  with a distant point, the first cross.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg38.print.gif" width="505" height="581"></p>
<p align="center"><b> And these gates shall not prevail against you...</b></p>
<p><b>Parchment One has given us the first indication of a geometry at the core 
  of the mystery. The Sion line forms the base of the triangle extending from 
  the upper left corner, as if it were a projection. This unusual 50/60/70 degree 
  triangle expands from the upper left corner to provide two fixed points, the 
  first cross and the N of SINON. We can find the center of this irregular triangle 
  by bisecting the angles...</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Six, the physical sun, Seven, the spiritual Sun.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Bisecting the angles exactly in half.</b></p>
<p><b>When we do, we find our first geometric oddity. The line from the first 
  cross in line 4 to the second cross in line 7 crosses the bisection line from 
  the 70 degree angle above the center point. This second center, pointed out 
  by the parchment itself, has the unusual property of being the point where two 
  concentric circles can be drawn, a large one which contains the smaller triangle, 
  and a smaller one which contains our fixed points, the 1st cross and the N of 
  SINON, and the base of the smaller triangle.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Bisecting the angles using clues from the Manuscript.</b></p>
<p><b>The precision of this quite clear. No other point will provide this concentric 
  circle pattern, and the parchment draws our attention to it with the connection 
  between the 1st and 2nd crosses. If we extend the bisection line of the 70 degree 
  angle to where it crosses our inner circle, then do the same for the line from 
  the 1st to the 2nd cross, and connect the points we have an irregular pentagram. 
  This image is truly striking and there can be doubt about the correctness and 
  simplicity of the steps required to compose it. But when we have drawn it, we 
  are still left asking the same questions.</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Three points are indicated as being important, the corners 
  of our projected triangle, and the unique center point for the concentric circles. 
  But why? We also have two alignments, the 70 degree bisection line and the 1st 
  to 2nd cross line. The third bisection line, from the outer point of the smaller 
  triangle, strikes the O of SION line, and if we continue this line to the inner 
  circle, and connect the points, we have an irregular hexagram. But other than 
  underscoring the importance of the SION line, we are left still wondering why? 
  WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SEE HERE? </b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Twenty</b></p>
<p><b>We can think of the parchment as having layers of meaning. The surface layer 
  is the text itself and its alchemical parable. The next level warns us that 
  this &quot;golden&quot; wisdom is only for the sacred initiates. Then the text 
  reveals the hidden message: &quot;To Dagobert the King, and to Sion, the treasure; 
  AND IT IS THERE, DEATH.&quot; The obscure device, the small triangle, in the 
  upper left leads us to its projection onto the text, suggesting that the next 
  level of meaning can be found through a geometric analysis. However, our expansion 
  of the projected triangle into a pentagram and a hexagram provides us little 
  further understanding. The six letters indicated by the complete hexagram do 
  tell us to NOTA M+, or note the M cross, perhaps a Mary or Magdalene cross, 
  but without more to go on this clue is also obscure.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>However, there are also the three SIONs which come together to form a very 
  precise alignment. Everything we have discovered so far indicates THAT THE 3rd 
  SION LINE IS CRUCIAL, and it plays a significant role in forming the alignment. 
  Sighting along the 3rd SION line, between the two O's as if looking down a valley, 
  the line hits the base SION line at a 47 degree angle. In addition, the final 
  N in SINON marks the right angle between the 1st and 2nd SION lines. WE NOW 
  HAVE THREE LOCALITIES, the two N's and the O where the 1st and 3rd SION lines 
  intersect, in a precise geometric arrangement. And if we extend the 2nd SION 
  line beyond the N and through the Solis Sacerdotibus, we find our attention 
  drawn to the raised T, the final letter in MORT, from the hidden message. Could 
  this be the T or cross we have been told to note?</b></p>
<p><b>(Insert: RLC - Blanchefort sunrise line)</b></p>
<p><b>And yet, we are no closer to locating ourselves on the ground, and thereby 
  making any sense of the riddle. We might imagine that this was the empasse which 
  caused our conspirators to pause and argue over brandy that rainy fall afternoon 
  in 1887. Because at this point, the puzzle can only be resolved by reference 
  to alignments on the ground, the questions becomes: where do you begin?</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Know that Summer is nigh...Matthew 24 (KJV).</b></p>
<p><b>We can imagine that all three of our conspirators had an opinion on that 
  one. But, let us imagine that was the point where the lovely Marie spoke up 
  to tell her distinguished listeners THE STORY OF THE SUMMER SUNRISE FROM RENNES-LE-CHATEAU.</b></p>
<p><b>If you stand at the eastern edge of the cemetery and look back toward Pech 
  Cardu, on the longest day of the year, the sun rises so that the ruins of Chateau 
  Blanchefort are silhouetted against it. It feels as if a long shadow is reaching 
  out directly for the church here at Rennes. We can imagine her pausing, flushing 
  faintly as she gained their attention. And that's not all. Rennes and Blanchefort 
  are just two of the five old sacred places WHERE THE WISE WOMEN SAY THERE ONCE 
  WAS A TEMPLE TO THE VIRGIN. There's a hill not far away where you can see all 
  five of them. Does that help?</b></p>
<p><b>And so, after, we assume, a moment of stunned silence, our conspirators 
  began to all talk at once and crowd around the Abbe Boudet's carefully annotated 
  maps. Marie showed them her mountains, and with compass and protractor in hand, 
  they set to work. The pentagon of mountains turned out to be too regular to 
  be the pentagram derived from the parchment. This was disappointing, but it 
  led to the realization that the Rennes/Blanchefort alignment was key.</b></p>
<p><b>The temptation is to see it as the 3rd SION line, with the N in SINON as 
  Blanchefort, but that yields no further significant alignments, and none with 
  the precise 47/43/90 degree angles described on the parchement. And then, with 
  a shift in thinking, it becomes clear that the 2nd SION line is the Rennes/Blanchefort 
  line. A little fiddling with the map reveals that Blanchefort is the corner 
  N of the 90 degree angle. The line extends beyond Blachefort to Arques, which 
  we can think of as the S in SINON. Extending the line in the other direction 
  brings us to our &quot;noted&quot; T, which then becomes Rennes-le-Chateau.</b></p>
<p><b>So far so good, but the test is in the angles. Is there a point that makes 
  a 90 degee angle to Blanchefort. Yes indeed, Rennes-le-Bains itself is a few 
  miles due south of Blanchefort, so our first angle works. The line from Rennes 
  to Arques crosses the Paris Meridan, the Zero meridan line of France, near the 
  so-called Poussin's tomb. Sighting from that point back toward Rennes-le-Bains 
  creates a 47 degree angle, making the meridan crossing the middle N of SINON. 
  We can extend the alignments on the 3rd SION line by exactly one mile from the 
  crossing and Rennes-le-Bains. One mile beyond the crossing point is an ancient 
  megalithic standing stone. One mile beyond Rennes-le-Bains is another area of 
  megaliths.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Therefore, we can now begin to locate the puzzle on the ground. By using 
  the SION line geometry, we have identified six locations noted in the parchment: 
  The T is Rennes-le-Chateau, the N is Blanchefort, the second N is the crossing 
  point and the S is Arques. Blanchefort is the intersection of SION lines one 
  and two, and the crossing point is the intersection of SION lines 2 and 3. The 
  O of the 1st SION line is Rennes-le-Bains and the second cross in the 3rd SION 
  line is the megalithic area southwest of Rennes-le-Bains.</b></p>
<p><b>Using the line from the Rennes-le-Chateau T to the Blanchefort N as one 
  side of a pentagon formed from the old mountain-top sacred sites, we can fill 
  in the rest of the figure. It covers the area of the text that is most irregular 
  in line length, including the Redis Bles, and is centered on a strange area 
  around the 3rd cross and the O of the 3rd SION line. However, this pentagon/gram 
  seems to give us no help in identifying the other two points of the original 
  projected triangle. All we have is one of the three points, the crossing of 
  the SION lines 2 and 3, which falls on the Paris Meridian.</b></p>
<p><b>But, the 3rd SION line passes through the central area of the pentagram 
  with its significant cross and O. We also have the T in the Rennes-le-Chateau 
  position which can also be used as a sighting point. Indeed, when we sight from 
  the base of the T to the base of the cross in the 3rd SION line, the extended 
  line strikes the peculiar extended corner of the small triangle in the upper 
  left corner. When we look at the angle indicated by this extended corner, we 
  find that it is 72 degrees, a pentagonal corner angle just as is the T from 
  which it was sighted. We may take this as some confirmation of the importance 
  of this alignment.</b></p>
<p><b>There are other alignments, many of them, possible from the T or Rennes-le-Chateau 
  point. One passes through the N of the SION in the hidden text and points to 
  the first T in the main text. Another passes through the O in the 3rd SION line 
  and points to the O just before the raised A in line two. A third connects the 
  lonely second cross in line 7. However, the PS encircled with a loop, as on 
  Marie de Blanchefort's gravestone, gives a clue as to the what might be the 
  most important alignment. A line through the center of the PS, angled so as 
  to touch both letters, passes through the base of the T and continues through 
  the cross to the peculiar corner of the small triangle. Along the way, it spells 
  out a message.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>As on the gravestone, the PS with a loop is a symbol for OR, gold, in French. 
  Following the line we find TER+A, or terra, earth. This gives us gold earth 
  or ore, at the peculiar triangle point. A slight displacement of 5 degrees shifts 
  the line to the top point of the extended angle of the small triangle and passes 
  through the center of the cross in the 3rd SION line while still emphasizing 
  the same letters. This makes the message, and the location it is pointing to, 
  even more significant.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Twenty One </b></p>
<p><b>Going from right to left from the T at Rennes-le-Chateau, we find an alignment 
  to the first cross at the head of the 3rd SION line, an alignment with the O, 
  the cross and the N. The markers on the 3rd SION line appear to be sighting 
  points for the T at Rennes-le-Chateau. Apparently, the only significant alignment 
  not marked on the 3rd SION line is the line to the 2nd cross in line 7. That 
  gives us five major sight lines indicated by the parchment aligned on the T 
  or cross at Rennes-le-Chateau, only one of which gives us a clear message: Gold 
  Ore Here. The importance of the point of the triangle indicated by the extended 
  angle grows when we connect it with our odd-ball 2nd cross. It hits the 2nd 
  cross at a 90 degree angle after passing through three other T's. This mimics 
  the alignments from the Rennes point, which has the three T's or crosses of 
  the 3rd SION line, and the final cross, the second cross in line 7. In addition, 
  the angles of the three crosses, 1 and 2 with the Rennes cross, form the base 
  triangle of another regular pentagon/gram, #3, which can be completed with alignments 
  from the Rennes T. Now, let's try to put this in order and see what it tells 
  us. Projecting the small triangle over the text gives us the 3rd SION line as 
  the base of the projected triangle. We are directed to the unique center point 
  by the line from the 1st cross to the second. Using this center to draw two 
  concentric circles allows us to create Pentagram #1, the irregular pentagram. 
  Developing this figure however leads us to a virtual dead end. </b></p>
<p><b>The SION alignments locate us in space, ALONG THE SUMMER SUNRISE ALIGNMENT 
  from Rennes to Blanchefort and the crossing point of the Paris Meridian, its 
  angular relationship to Rennes-le-Bains and the 3rd cross in line 10. From this, 
  we can develop the regular Pentagram #2. While this locates us in space by defining 
  the Rennes-le-Chateau corner of the pentagram as a sighting point, it proves 
  unhelpful in identifying the other locations. But locating the T in MORT as 
  Rennes-le-Chateau does allow us to use it as a sighting point with which to 
  align the PS and the 3rd cross with the oddly accented corner of the small triangle. 
  We can't go too far wrong by supposing that this is one of the most significant 
  alignments on the parchment. However, we still have only one point, Rennes-le-Chateau, 
  identified. Using the angle defined by the supposed Rennes/Blanchefort line, 
  45 degrees, we find no significant alignments on the map. Using the length as 
  a relative distance marker brings us to nothing but bare mountain side. Either 
  something is wrong with our alignment, which hardly seems likely, or something 
  is wrong with our assumptions about the angle and distance from Rennes-le-Chateau 
  to Blanchefort. As we mull it over, the assignment of places to the intersection 
  of the SION lines SEEMS TO BE PURELY SYMBOLIC, pointing to the pattern of angular 
  ratios, without specifying exact spatial relationships. Blanchefort is not located 
  by the final N in SINON, it is merely symbolized by the N. The same with the 
  N of the meridian crossing point: its location is symbolic within the angular 
  pattern. So where are these places? Does the parchment tell us? Indeed it does. 
  Pentagrams #1 and #2, while clearly indicated on the parchment, do little to 
  help us locate any single spot on the ground. They do provide a series of co-ordinating 
  points, which require the development of Pentagram #3 in order to become actual 
  spatial relationships. </b></p>
<p><b>The way this is coded on the parchment is nothing short of genius. Whoever 
  designed this was a master puzzle maker. The problem is that the pentagonal 
  pattern on the ground must be modeled on the parchment in such a way as to represent 
  actual spatial relationships. Pentagram #2 is regular enough to be the pentacle 
  of mountain tops, but the spatial ratios don't match. If the last N in the SINON 
  line is Blanchefort, then the N of the meridian crossing is too close in relation 
  to the distance between Rennes and Blanchefort. The same applies to finding 
  Rennes-le-Bains in relation to the N as Blanchefort: the distances don't match 
  the map. Let me note however that if we stay in the immediate area of the 47 
  degree SION line alignments, the scale itself is accurate. The 3rd cross point, 
  in this scale, falls on the intersection of the 3rd SION line and the inner 
  line of Pentagram #2. The ratios are accurate, we just haven't found the right 
  scale. However, we have tentatively identified the T in saceradotibus, sacred 
  initiates, as Rennes-le-Chateau. On the face of it, this makes sense, and none 
  of the problems with scale effect our choice of this point. Therefore let us 
  assume that this is our one clearly located point, and that the alignments from 
  that point along the 3rd SION line are significant. As noted above, there are 
  five major alignments suggested by the 3rd SION line from the Rennes-le-Chateau 
  T. Four remain the same, but the fifth, from Rennes to the final N in SINON 
  is clearly inaccurate. All five of these alignments are used to create Pentagram 
  #3. Connecting alignments 1 and 4 with the line from the 1st to the 2nd cross 
  in the text gives us the geometric basis of the pentagram, a 36/72/72 degree 
  triangle. Alignment 2, through the O's, points to the top point of the pentagram 
  developed from the triangle of crosses. Alignment 3, the Gold Ore Here line, 
  passes through a corner angle of the pentagram as an accuracy marker. The fifth 
  alignment is the new line to Blanchefort and falls on the continuation of the 
  3rd SION line. This pentagram, #3, allows us to precisely locate the pentacle 
  of mountain tops by means of sight lines from Rennes-le-Chateau. In addition, 
  when we extend the Rennes/Blanchefort line to the point where it crosses the 
  vertical line from the odd corner of the small triangle, through three T's and 
  the 2nd cross, we find that we have an accurate distance ratio between our three 
  points, Rennes, Blanchefort and the meridian crossing point. This check assures 
  us that we have found the right pentagram alignments. When we place these alignments 
  on the map, something immediately jumps out at us. The odd point of the small 
  triangle falls on the ancient gold mine at Bugarach. Indeed, the ruined chateau, 
  the ancient mine and an equally antique spring and reservoir form our 50/60/70 
  degree triangle, as indicated on the parchment. An ancient gold mine, perhaps 
  even the fabled Pyrene of Herodotus, is certainly indicated by a line that reads 
  Gold Ore Here on the parchment. Could this be the secret? Hardly, because the 
  mine itself has been located since Roman times. Pomponnius Mela identified it 
  around the time of the Consul Caepio who looted the treasure of Toulouse. Locating 
  the gold mine is important, BUT IT CAN'T BE THE SECRET ITSELF. TO LOCATE THAT 
  WE NEED THE STONE OF ZION. </b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Twenty Two </b></p>
<p><b>There is one last alignment from the T at Rennes which we haven't yet examined. 
  It runs from the T, through the Redis Bles, then through the cross bar of the 
  final N in the Sion of the hidden text, then on through the unique center point 
  to the first T in the main text. This line gives us the letters T, S, E, I, 
  N, and passes between the 3rd cross and the O in the 3rd SION line. Including 
  these, we now have Et SION +, or &quot;and (to) SION (the) cross.&quot; This 
  of course echoes the hidden text, &quot;AND TO SION IS THE TREASURE,&quot; LEADING 
  US TO CONNECT THE CROSS, (but which one?) WITH THE TREASURE. We now have five 
  repetitions of the key word. The fourth is in line 9, the SION hidden in the 
  text, and the fifth is the convoluted occult SION of the T to T line. Three 
  of these five lines intersect in a triangle composed of the final N in line 
  9, and the 3rd cross and O of the 3rd SION line. The other two Sion lines form 
  a right angle base from which a rectangle can be formed that defines the isosceles 
  triangle of the N, the O and the 3rd cross. A wealth of esoteric science is 
  revealed by these five SION lines. The 5th SION line is like an arrow head pointing 
  to the first T in the text by sighting ON THE UNIQUE CENTER POINT. Why?</b></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/WheelofDharma.gif" width="308" height="298"></p>
<p><b>The location on the ground of that T IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE X OR T MARKS THE 
  SPOT WHERE WE SHOULD BEGIN TO LOOK FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE SECRET, OR THE TREASURE, 
  IS HIDDEN. To find it though, we must triangulate from Rennes, the ancient gold 
  mine at the odd corner point and the locality of the 1st cross. If the point 
  which falls off the parchment is Blanchefort, the 1st cross is Serre de Lauzet. 
  Unfortunately, the line from the mine to the 1st cross at Serre de Lauzet is 
  straight. Which means that everything depends on determining the angle at which 
  the 5th SION line crosses the line from the mine to the 1st cross. An error 
  from Rennes of a few degrees could mean hundreds of yards on the ground. The 
  only assurance of accuracy was to find some kind of marker at the N point in 
  the 4th SION line that precisely defined the angle of intersection. The parchment 
  suggests that something like this exists. The angle of the line precisely matches 
  the cross bar of the N, and if only something marked this on the ground, then 
  the precise location of the initial T, and the treasure, could be found. </b></p>
<p><b>And so, our four conspirators set off the next morning to find the marker 
  stone. Since this is imagination, let us envision a beautiful fall day, with 
  brilliantly clear sunlight and a rain-washed atmosphere that allows one to see 
  for miles. It is also a fine day for a picnic. A few miles of tramping across 
  the countryside brings them to the general location of the N on the parchment. 
  They spread out to search and soon one of them finds what they are looking for: 
  the Zion stone. A few hundred yards northwest of the Coume-Sourde farmhouse 
  and perhaps covering the springhead of Coume-Sourde creek, was a strange flat 
  stone with a geometric carving and a few words in simple and ambiguous Latin. 
  A check with a compass and a tracing of the parchment reveals that this is the 
  key, an arrow pointing to the secret. Today, the Zion or Coume-Sourde stone 
  can be seen to the left of the door as one enters the presbytery from the courtyard 
  at Rennes. Like so many clues, it has been defaced, probably by Sauniere in 
  the dark years. One of his friends, the engineer and amateur archeologist Ernest 
  Cros, protested this mutilation, and his sketches are our only source for both 
  the Zion stone and Marie de Blanchefort's gravestone. To Sauniere however, its 
  location and placement were the real clues. Without them the triangle and the 
  inscription are meaningless. The stone is a rough square, six inches thick about 
  two feet in height and width. On its surface, according to Mr. Cros' sketch, 
  was a 50/65/65 degree triangle enclosing another smaller triangle, this one 
  36/36/108 degrees, with a contiguous base line. There was a cross at the apex 
  of both triangles and a Latin inscription that reads&quot; &quot;In medio Linae 
  ubi M secat - Linae parva - P.S Praecum.&quot; It is hard to derive a meaning 
  from these fragmented and ungrammatical Latin phrases. The best we can do is: 
  &quot;In the middle (of) the line where M (is) isolated - line (through) space 
  - P.S before/with.&quot; Also, at the upper corners, were the letters SAE and 
  SIS, which seem to have no direct meaning as words. </b></p>
<p><b>Perhaps they are initials or code, in which case we are reminded of the 
  ISIS mid-point on Marie de Blanchefort's gravestone. They probably represent 
  the 3rd cross and O points from the 3rd SION line on the parchment, and on the 
  ground serve as markers for the Zion stone, which is probably represented by 
  the cross at the apex of the internal triangle. In which case, the second cross 
  on the Zion stone, by extension, points to the initial cross on the parchment, 
  and the location of the treasure or secret. If the alignment of crosses on the 
  Zion stone matched the angle of the N in the hidden SION in its original placement, 
  then that would allow Sauniere and the others to take a precise reading of the 
  T's location. The stone itself says: that the spot is &quot;in the middle of 
  the line where the M is isolated.&quot; If we think of the isolated M as the 
  M above the small triangle, then what &quot;line&quot; are we talking about? 
  If we draw a line from the upper most tip of the extended angle on the small 
  triangle, the point closest to the M, through the top point of pentagram #3, 
  it also defines a backstop point beyond the initial T which falls on the exact 
  mid point of the line, the isolated M line, the line that passes through &quot;space&quot; 
  rather than through the text. The PS Praecum tells us that the secret, before/with, 
  of the gold can be found there. Equally as interesting, if we think of the T 
  of MORT, Rennes, as the pommel of the MORT epee of Marie de Blanchefort's headstone, 
  then the Zion stone becomes the hilt, with the initial T as the point. The place 
  where the Zion stone was found is called Coume-Sourde, which in French might 
  be translated as Sleepy Hollow, and which sounds as if it were Cum-a- Sword, 
  or &quot;with a sword.&quot; It has the added Green Language twist of being 
  a hollow or invisible sword from the connotations of the French word &quot;sourde.&quot; 
  Simply follow the hollow or invisible Mort line of the Epee on the ground and 
  you will find the missing T, or cross, which marks the treasure. We can be sure 
  that our group did just that, and soon arrived at the point on the ground. Once 
  there, they only had to follow the directions given in the final decoding of 
  the second parchment and its anagram on the headstone to find the exact location 
  of the treasure. Once found however, the real work began. With the missing T 
  of D'Haupol located, the next step was to apply the message found in the second 
  parchment. </b></p>
<p><b>This parchment was also a botched selection from the Bible, this time from 
  the Gospel of John. The text is from John 12: 1- 11 -- the Bethany sequence 
  with Mary and Martha is interesting in its own right -- and contains 140 extra 
  letters. The center 12 of these letters spelled out &quot;Ad Genesareth,&quot; 
  OR LITERALLY,&quot;TO THE EARTH SOURCE.&quot; It is also the Hebrew name for 
  the sea of Galilee. When we remove these 12 letters, we are left with 128, the 
  number of letters on Marie de Blanchefort's headstone plus the PS Praecum. By 
  a series of permutations, involving the Vigenere table and the Knight's tour 
  of two chess boards, these extra letters are transformed into a relatively clear 
  message. The original is French, and an English translation reads: &quot;Shepherdess 
  no temptation that Poussin Teniers hold the key - peace 681 by the cross and 
  this horse of God I complete (or destroy) this Daemon Guardian at midday Blue 
  Apples.&quot; As I say, this is relatively clear, but is actually only indirectly 
  meaningful, a possible red herring that must be checked out. It is however a 
  perfect anagram for Marie de Blanchefort's headstone plus the PS Praecum. In 
  order to get the correct directions, one must use the same code pattern with 
  the key words of REX MUNDI, which is spelled out in odd small letters on the 
  second parchment, and the 46 letters on the gravestone (Et in+ Arca+dio Ego 
  - PS - Reddis Regis Arcis Cellis - Praecum), plus the 11 letters (Th is one 
  letter in Hebrew) of AD GENESARETh for a total of 57, ZN or Zion. This is repeated 
  twice, leaving a 14 letter gap that is filled by Solis Redis Bles. When we complete 
  the process, a new message appears. It reads, in English as: &quot;Native Roman 
  Gold - Hautpol - Deposits: Visigothic Alaric Royal - Templars Bezu - access 
  karst south Aven rays LLLLLLXV.M (315) points Aven - P. carla - Roi Mort (dead 
  king) MMLLLLXLV.M (2,245).&quot; While this is still rather mysterious, at least 
  now we have distances to measure from th small hilltop village of Serrat Cremat, 
  a name which seems to mean Forced Cremation, or Sabbath Bonfire in te M cross. 
  Applying this on the ground leads to a small cave opening a few hundred yards 
  down the slope from thehe local dialect. Near the cave area are the ruins of 
  Chateau Hautpol destroyed by Simon de Montfort, who sent the entire garrison 
  and all the occupants of the fortress to the stake, hence the village's unusual 
  name. The cave opening can be seen on the parchment, below and to the right 
  of the initial T, which we can think of as the missing T in D'Haupol on Marie 
  de Blanchefort's headstone. It is the only O with a center point, marking an 
  entrance perhaps. Eventually we can be sure that our conspirators made it to 
  this point and explored the cave. Since none of the group has left us any direct 
  evidence, we can only evaluate the significance of that find by looking at what 
  happened next.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Twenty Three </b></p>
<p><b>It must have taken the group a few months to complete their find and assess 
  its importance. By the spring of 1888, however, things were beginning to move. 
  Johann renewed his contacts with various occult and chivalric orders, and, most 
  important of all, he reconnected with his cousin, the Crown Prince Rudolph of 
  Austria-Hungary. Rudolph, six years younger than Johann and Sauniere, was an 
  unhappy, frustrated and idealistic young liberal heir to a vast, conservative 
  AND ABOVE ALL CATHOLIC EMPIRE. In 1888 Rudolph turned 30, and his father -- 
  Franz Joseph had been on the throne for forty years -- showed no inclination 
  toward sharing authority or including his son in the workings of government. 
  This, in many ways, was the crowning frustration of a tortured and disturbed 
  life. As a young boy, Rudolph's tutor, the Count Gondrecourt, bullied and abused 
  him in a misguided attempt to toughen his nerve. Fortunately, his mother, the 
  Empress Elizabeth intervened. It was perhaps the only really kind thing she 
  ever did for her son. Elizabeth, an intelligent and sensitive person caught 
  in a loveless marriage and the internal intrigues of the imperial court, virtually 
  abandoned Rudolph, taking long tours abroad to escape the stifling atmosphere 
  in Vienna. Rudolph of course had no escape. A marriage had been arranged in 
  1881 to Stephanie of Belgium, which turned out to be a disaster. Stephanie was 
  a dull but cheerful child. They were betrothed when she was fifteen and the 
  wedding had to be postponed until she began to menstruate. Rudolph was smitten 
  at first with her simple beauty, but soon tired of her. A series of affairs 
  developed, including a liaison with the dancer Mitzi Kasper. By the time he 
  turned thirty in 1888, Rudolph's brilliance had begun to turn wild. Rudolph 
  and Johann would be in continual contact for the next eight months until Rudolph's 
  death. While the great secret, or even Rennes-le-Chateau, is never mentioned, 
  there is evidence that Johann and Rudolph were planning some sort of coup. In 
  the fall of 1888, Rudolph almost shot his father, Franz Joseph, &quot;accidentally&quot; 
  on the hunting field. Rudolph was asked to leave for the day and the matter 
  was hushed up. It was also the last time Franz Joseph saw his son alive. On 
  January 30th 1889, Rudolph and his current mistress, Maria Vetsera, were found 
  dead in the Imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling. Rumors leaked out that it was 
  a suicide pact between the lovers. This was scandalous enough to quell any further 
  investigation, and might just have been a smoke-screen. It is possible that 
  Rudolph posed such a threat to the Empire THAT HE WAS KILLED BY THE IMPERIAL 
  SECRET SERVICE. There are many suggestive pieces of evidence for this conclusion, 
  but for our purposes, the most important concerns the Archduke Johann. In the 
  days before his death, Rudolph entrusted to the Countess Larisch, one of his 
  admirers and the one who introduced him to Maria, a locked steel box with the 
  instruction to give it only to the person who gave the code word: RIOU. This 
  is of course a contraction of the House of Austria's motto ; &quot;Austria est 
  Imperare Orbi Universo,&quot; into perhaps &quot;Rudolph Imperare Orbi Universo,&quot; 
  or even &quot;Rhedae Imperare Orbi Universo.&quot; On the day of Rudolph's funeral, 
  the Countess received a message with the code word. As instructed, she later 
  that night met a man whom she recognized as the Archduke Johann. He took the 
  steel box and told her it contained secrets so dire that if Franz Joseph caught 
  a whiff of it, they would all be shot. We might dismiss this as mere &quot;Prisoner 
  of Zenda&quot; melodrama, except that there is independent confirmation of the 
  box's existence. Johann renounced his title in the weeks after Rudolph's funeral. 
  He also bought a ship and studied for his master's certificate in navigation. 
  On March 26, 1890, Captain Johann Orth sailed the St. Margaret for South America. 
  His mistress, Milli Stubel, joined him in Buenos Aires and on July 12, they 
  set off around Cape Horn. They were never officially seen again. Years later, 
  Milli's sister told her story to a Viennese newspaper and confirmed the existence 
  of the steel box. Johann gave it to Milli for save keeping and she took it with 
  her when she left for South America. It was filled with documents in code, the 
  sister noted. Could Johann and Rudolph have attempted a sort of inside coup, 
  threatening Franz Joseph, pressuring him to step aside in favor of Rudolph? 
  </b></p>
<p><b>The one intriguing point is the connection of Johann and the steel box. 
  His significance in the story is unclear without the connection to Rennes. The 
  coded documents could have been the proofs worked out above pointing to the 
  treasure site near Bugarach. What about these documents would have meant death 
  to Rudolph and Johann? What is it about this treasure that makes its possessors 
  feel that they are power players in western politics? Johann and Rudolph misjudged 
  the reaction. They felt entitled, and therefore never saw it coming. Once Rudolph 
  was dead and discredited, the plan was over. Johann renounced his title, went 
  into exile, and disappeared. Whatever their plan, it was blown. And the Austrian 
  secret service was aware of a deadly secret in Rennes-le-Chateau. In a reaction 
  so violent that an heir to the throne is killed, we can be sure that such loose 
  ends as the source of the secret would also be attended to. First, an attempt 
  would be made to silence them by force, and then, if that failed, an attempt 
  at negotiation would be offered. Eventually, an accommodation would be reached, 
  and the secret would be kept. Such in fact was exactly what happened.</b></p>
<p align="center"> <b>Twenty Four</b></p>
<p><b>Sauniere was warned, either by the fact of Rudolph's death or by a visit 
  from Johann before he disappeared. The Abbe spent the year after Johann's departure 
  in the small village of Antugnac, near his home in Montazels. We might suggest 
  that the good Abbe was in hiding. However, by the spring of 1891, Sauniere was 
  back in Rennes-le-Chateau with big plans. On June 21, he staged a procession 
  through the village with a statue of the Virgin of Lourdes, which he then had 
  installed on the Visigothic pillar in the garden of the church. This dedication 
  to the Virgin kicked off another round of restoration, which in September resulted 
  in the finding of a tomb and a treasure, all mysteriously stage-managed by Sauniere. 
  The Mission 1891 carved on the new base of the Visigothic pillar suggests that 
  Sauniere had indeed embarked on a mission to get the information out. Or at 
  least part of the secret. Mission 1891 started with the staged discovery of 
  the tomb, perhaps the same one found in the summer of 1887, and a careful distribution 
  of the genealogies and the parchments. First, the verger found a vial with a 
  letter from the Abbe Bigou's uncle giving clear directions where to look for 
  the tomb of Sigisbert IV. The directions were followed and a tomb containing 
  Merovingian relics were found, just where the register of 1694 mentions the 
  tomb of the &quot;Seigneurs de Rennes.&quot; A few days later, a group of local 
  dignitaries, including engineer Cros, the Abbe Gelis of Couiza, and others, 
  were invited in and shown the tomb and the parchments. In 1892, Sauniere went 
  to Paris for a week, visiting St. Sulpice and rubbing shoulders with the radical 
  right wing of the occult underworld. He was supposedly getting help decoding 
  the parchments, but was actually looking for Johann's contacts. It can be argued 
  that Sauniere's visits to Paris CHANGED THE COURSE OF WESTERN OCCULTISM, AND 
  MAYBE EVEN THE COURSE OF HISTORY. That of course is another story. It did at 
  least make him known to those who thought that the secret was dangerous, and 
  it gained him support among those who thought to use that danger.</b></p>
<p><b> The restoration continued, a new pulpit and a statue of Mary Magdalene 
  above the door in 1891, and a new confessional in 1892, as well as structural 
  work including a secret room. All of it apparently paid for by Sauniere's new-found 
  source of wealth. His lifestyle also changed, and Marie Denaraud began to wear 
  the latest Paris fashions. Sauniere bought property in Marie's name and began 
  to build an unusual grotto near the calvary on the village square. Plans were 
  made to build a new house, the Villa Bethania, in which to entertain the now 
  frequent streams of distinguished visitors. A complaint was lodged with the 
  local police Prefect in 1895 about his nocturnal activity in Rennes' cemetery. 
  Nothing seems to have happened from the complaint, and Sauniere went on spending. 
  The year 1897 saw the peak of the restoration to the church, including THE MYSTERIOUS 
  STATIONS OF THE CROSS and the guardian Devil holding the water stoup. By 1900, 
  the work was finished, and Sauniere turned his attention to the Villa Bethania, 
  which was finished, including the Tour Magdala, by 1905. However, just as Sauniere's 
  domain was complete, the bottom fell out. Things had been going badly for a 
  while. The mysterious deaths started in 1897 with the Abbe Gelis, brutally murdered 
  in his own church. The Abbe Billard of Carcassone, Sauniere's staunchest supporter, 
  was also murdered in 1902. He was replaced by the Abbe de Beausejour, who quickly 
  became the nemesis of both Sauniere and Boudet. Sometime in this period, three 
  deaths occurred at Rennes-le-Chateau. The bodies were discovered in 1956 during 
  an excavation of Sauniere's garden. They were all male, between 30 and 40, and 
  all were shot. Did Sauniere beat off an attack from the same assassins that 
  had killed Rudolph and the Abbe Gelis? </b></p>
<p><b>The basis of the church in France changed in 1905 with its nationalization. 
  The government, not the church, authorities were now in charge. The Abbe de 
  Beausejour had real clout and used it to put an end to the funny goings-on at 
  Rennes-le-Chateau. Sauniere was removed as priest at Rennes in 1909, and was 
  tried before the Bishopric on the matter of his wealth. The church accused him 
  of selling masses or indulgences, and he was called to account for it. In 1911, 
  he was officially reprimanded by the Bishop of Carcassone for simony and forbidden 
  to administer the sacraments. Sauniere never regained his position as parish 
  Priest at Rennes-le-Chateau, but he never left either. He continued to serve 
  as spiritual adviser to the village to the extent that the local population 
  had to be reminded of the interdiction against him in the Carcassone newspaper 
  in 1915. That same year, Sauniere made a lengthy pilgrimage to Lourdes and came 
  back invigorated and enthusiastic about additions to the Tower. He remained 
  hopeful throughout 1916. However, just after the New Year of 1917, Sauniere 
  received a disturbing message. The Abbe Boudet had died in Axat under mysterious 
  circumstances in 1914. Perhaps the message was a warning from a mutual friend 
  or even scare tactics from the murderers. At any rate, Sauniere was found unconscious, 
  suffering supposedly from a stroke, at the foot of his tower soon after a visit 
  from two strangers. It was January 17, 1917. He died four days later on January 
  22. </b></p>
<p><b>His funeral, on January 24, was unusual. His corpse was placed upright in 
  the courtyard of Villa Bethania, draped in a red shawl or cloak with tassels. 
  The villagers filed by to pay their respects, each plucking tassel as a sign 
  of remembrance. Strangely enough, this ritual was traditionally done for the 
  Seigneurs of Rennes. Marie Denaraud survived until 1953, and kept her secret 
  until the end. Sauniere, during the dark years of 1909 through 1911, tried erase 
  all evidence of the mystery, defacing tombstones and rearranging landmarks. 
  But the secret was out, and not even Sauniere could put it back again. Mr. Cros 
  had made copies of the gravestones, and copies of the parchments had been given, 
  in more hopeful days, to the mayor of the village. The death of Sauniere marks 
  the end of our history of mystification. FROM THERE ON, THE STORY BECOMES THE 
  MYSTIFICATION OF HISTORY. </b></p>
<p><b>Sauniere, Boudet and Johann found something of incredible importance, something 
  that brought death and danger to all those who knew its secret. However, even 
  though we can now follow the clues as they did, we are left wondering just what 
  could have been so important? The bloodline of Jesus, the treasure of the Temple 
  of Jerusalem, and so on are powerful ideas, but, at their strongest, could even 
  proof of these ideas have had the leverage necessary to scare the Catholic and 
  Imperial forces into such a severe reaction? No matter how we look at the facts, 
  we are led inextricably to the thought THAT THERE IS STILL MORE HERE. BUT WHAT 
  COULD IT BE?</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The strange mysticism of the Sefer 
    Bahir was only one of the elements in the creation of a vast mystical movement. 
    In the highly charged atmosphere of open heresy and independence--unique for 
    the theological orthodoxy of the Middle Ages--JEWISH SAGES OF MANY KINDS FLOCKED 
    TO SOUTHERN FRANCE FOR THE OPENNESS AND EXPERIMENTATION IT ALLOWED. The followers 
    of the German Hasidim established contacts in the south and they were responsible 
    for the rise of a special class of full-time mystics--ascetic &quot;Nazarites&quot; 
    who responded by their dedication and behavior to the &quot;perfecti&quot; 
    or &quot;bonhommes&quot; of the Cathars. At the same time, immigrants from 
    Muslim Spain, now being slowly overrun by the rough-and-tumble Christian forces, 
    made their way northward. They brought with them the tenets and texts of neoplatonic 
    philosophy, in which God's energy was seen as a series of emanations cascading 
    down to earth and becoming more material as it descended through the heavenly 
    spheres...</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Earthly affairs played the primary 
    role in determining the fate of the various schools of the Jewish mystics. 
    By the end of the twelfth century the Cathars had gained control of most of 
    Provence...And precisely at this time, during the simultaneous mystical revival 
    of the Jewish community, a number of preeminent Jewish scholars in Southern 
    France claimed to have received miraculous visits from the prophet Elijah--a 
    sure sign of the revelation of a profound new mystery.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg356.gif" width="531" height="710"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Indeed, the appearance of the 
    Bahir was just the beginning of a period of experimentation and speculation 
    of the nature of God. For depending on the influences that each of the leaders 
    absorbed, a distinct brand of mysticism emerged. Yet each of the sages to 
    whom Elijah reportedly appeared seems to have shared a basic and highly heretical 
    question: If the Supreme God of the universe was beyond all reckoning, shouldn't 
    the prayers of the faithful be directed to the collective or individual sefirot? 
    The respected Abraham ben Isaac, chief of the rabbinic court in Narbonne--by 
    no stretch of the imagination a radical--carefully and circumspectly acknowledged 
    that there might be a profound truth to this vision of God's emanated powers, 
    accessible and understandable, in contrast to the Ineffable God...The last 
    person in medieval Provence who claimed to have been a recipient of a visit 
    of Elijah was Jacob &quot;the Nazarite&quot;...</font></p>
  <p>(Soon afterwards)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The son of 
    one of the noted mystics of the previous generation, now emerged as a leader 
    of a secret esoteric movement that would have enormous influence. He was Isaac 
    &quot;the Blind,&quot; the first medieval kabbalist whose personality and 
    mystical powers comes through clearly in his surviving writings and in the 
    frequent references to his words and techniques of meditation...HE VIEWED 
    THE HEAVENLY WORLD NOT AS A SECRET BUT A SCIENCE. And in the study and teachings 
    of that science and its practical application in the focused concentration 
    of prayer, he showed his followers how it might be possible to ascend along 
    the path of the energy, up to the highest sefirah--of God's limitless and 
    non-articulated thought.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His commentary on the Book of Creation 
    was the first to attempt to regularize and describe the Seven lower sefirot 
    and to understand how their qualities effected the flow of divine energy into 
    the world. At the heart of his belief--and at the culmination of this first 
    great transition of Jewish mysticism in Europe from Chariot worship and incantation 
    to a philosophical discipline--was Isaac's conviction that just as divine 
    energy flows outward along the trunk and branches of the Tree of Life to every 
    object, thought, and creature, so it has the potential of flowing back. There 
    is no necessary dualism between spirit and matter. All has its roots in the 
    emanations of the Ineffable God, and that rootedness forms a potential connection 
    by which energy can return to its source. Thus in his technique of meditation, 
    Isaac taught his students how they might ascend into the worlds of the sefirot 
    and, in their thought, merge with the highest levels.Yet it was not to be 
    an escape from the world or a complete merging with God. The object of this 
    mysticism was the establishment of a powerful, energized connection between 
    heaven and earth.&quot; </font>Heavenly Powers, Unraveling The Secret History

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE MYSTERY OF SHEKINAH</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a very true sense in which 
    the secret doctrines of Israel must be said to center in the Mystery, whatsoever 
    it may be, which lies behind the wonder and glory of Shekinah...There is furthermore 
    a very true sense in which it may be said that out of this mystery all Kabbalism 
    seems to issue and, moreover, goes back therein...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sole object with which the 
    Holy One, blessed be (They), sends man into the world is to know that YHVH 
    is Elohim. Herein is also all true joy of heart. Now it is in this manner 
    that I open the high conference respecting the Mystery of Shekinah, which 
    is the mystery of man and God, of man in the likeness of Elohim, of the relationship 
    of all things above and below, of intercourse, for union upon earth performed 
    in the spirit of celestial union, and the transmutation of one by the other 
    is the work of God in the world. In this union abides the Mystery of Faith, 
    which is the synthesis of the whole Law...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It must be remembered that Elohim 
    is a title of Shekinah...She is called the Mirror of YHVH. She is now the 
    Daughter of the King; she is now the Betrothed, the Bride and the Mother, 
    and again she is sister in relation to the world of man at large. There is 
    a sense in which the Daughter of God is--or becomes--the Mother of man. In 
    respect of the manifest universe, she is the architect of worlds, acting in 
    virtue of the Word uttered by God in creation. In respect of the myth of Paradise, 
    the Shekinah is the Eden which is above, whence the river of life flows forth 
    and waters the garden below. And this is also Shekinah as she is conceived 
    in external things--or Bride, Daughter and Sister in the world below. Considered 
    in her Divine Womanhood, in the world of transcendence, she is the Beloved 
    who ascends toward the Heavenly Spouse. And she is Matrona who unites with 
    the King, for the perfection of the Divine Male is in the Divine Female. Hence 
    it is said that the perfection of YHVH is in Elohim...She is that Divine Presence 
    which walked in the Garden of Eden in the cool of the evening, which went 
    before Israel in the desert and protects the just man who has fulfilled the 
    precepts, dwelling in his house and going forth with him in his journeys...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shekinah (the Glory of the Lord) 
    is female in essential aspect, whether as the Bride of God in that transcendent 
    state wherein there is no distinction between her and the Holy One, or whether 
    as the tutelary guide of humanity... It is said elsewhere that those who understand 
    these male and female relationships know the great wisdom. But the exposition 
    as to this wisdom is given...when it is stated that Matrona is feminine in 
    so far as she is not in union , but in that state (where she is sowing the 
    seed, teaching, instructing), she is identified with the Male principle, and 
    this is how the interchange of sex in divine things must be understood throughout. 
    So also Matrona, who is an aspect of (God's Glory) is indifferently male and 
    female, changing incessantly according to the vibrations of the union. Now 
    it is said that Shekinah is to Metatron what the Sabbath is to weekdays. In 
    other words she is Rest and the rapture of Rest, yet it is that rest in which 
    there is the intercourse of spiritual union...</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two points which should 
    be memorized on this subject. At the apex of the union between male and female--which 
    is to be understood only in the spiritual sense--the sex differentiation has 
    ceased: it can only be from this point of view that the Shekinah is mentioned 
    sometimes as if she were on the male side. This is the first point, and the 
    second is that in characteristics and in mission, she is always typically 
    female; it is she who comprises all women in her mystery, and this is why, 
    as we shall see, she does not abide except with him who is united to a woman

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is one definition which is 
    in keeping with the tradition at large, and this is that marriage is the union 
    of the Sacred Name here below--that is, its completion in every person. The 
    thesis is that circumcision </font>(the spiritual circumcision of the heart, 
    to which all must attain)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> is the 
    symbol of all purity in sexual intercourse...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This sacred sign of the Covenant 
    constitutes the root-matter of the Sacred Name and of the Mystery of Faith. 
    As the Sun enlightens the world, so the sacred sign </font>(circumcision)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    enlightens the body. </font>(It reveals the nature and the power of the Flesh...Galatians 
    5)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...But as the advantage is greater 
    with which the children of Israel begin their earthly life, so is the responsibility 
    greater if they make the Covenant of no effect in their own person.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the Sacred Name is never attached 
    to an incomplete (person), being one who is unmarried </font>(male with female, 
    female with male)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, or one who dies 
    without issue.</font>(Remember, we must divide the Word correctly. We are 
    discussing spiritual principles, not literal restrictions. Paul himself was 
    both unmarried and without issue in the purely literal and physical sense; 
    but greatly married and with many children in the spiritual sense)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Such a person does not penetrate after death into the vestibule of Paradise, 
    on account of their incompleteness. They must be planted anew--that is to 
    say, they must suffer rebirth, as we have seen, in order that the Sacred Name 
    my be complete in all directions...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God blessed Adam because they were 
    made male and female, and blessings are found only where male and female are 
    united for the purpose of creation which--according to the counsel of Elohim--was 
    to increase, multiply and replenish the earth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And we have next to see after what 
    manner those who exalted so highly the nuptial state gave instruction on its 
    practice here below. The doctrine was that no marriage is made on earth before 
    it is proclaimed in heaven </font>(Understand Joel 2:16)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    and that the Holy One accomplishes unions in the world above before the descent 
    of souls on earth...The fulfillment of the marriage is in the raising of the 
    heart and mind on the part of the lover and beloved, to the Most Holy Shekinah, 
    the glory which cohabits and indwells during the external act...so that the 
    two spirits are melted together and are interchanged constantly between body 
    and body...In the indistinguishable state which arises it may be said that 
    the male is with the female neither male nor female: at least they are both 
    or either. So is man affirmed and composed of the world above, which is male, 
    and of the female world below. The same is true of both.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the Zohar those words 
    in the Song of Solomon&quot; &quot;Thy breasts are better than wine&quot; 
    refer to that wine which provokes joy and desire; and seeing that all things 
    are formed above according to a pattern which is reproduced faithfully below, 
    it is held to follow that when desire awakens beneath it awaken also on high. 
    Herein lies the sanctity of espousals on earth and herefrom depends the need 
    for exalting that sanctity and all that belongs to espousals in the highest 
    grade.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Children of the Doctrine are 
    described (in the Zohar) as reserving conjugal relations for the night of 
    the Sabbath, being the moment when the Holy One is united to the Community 
    of Israel. The thesis is that God is One and as such it is agreeable to Him 
    to be particularly concerned with a people who are One. Out of this arises 
    the question as to when &quot;man&quot; may be called One, and the answer 
    is that this comes about when the male is united to the female in a holy purpose: 
    it is then that man is complete, is one, and is without blemish. It is of 
    this that the two must think at the moment of their union; it is in uniting 
    bodies and souls that the two become One. Man in particular is termed one 
    and perfect; they draw down the Holy Spirit upon them and are called the Son 
    of the Holy One, blessed be (They).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Rabbi Simeon, the 
    relations of the patriarchs with their wives were actuated by a Supreme Mystery. 
    So long as Jacob was unmarried, God did not manifest to him clearly, and this 
    mystery is familiar to those who are acquainted with the ways of the Law. 
    After marriage he arrived at the perfection which is above, as distinguished 
    from the perfection which is below, and God manifested to him clearly. The 
    explanation that the Supreme Wisdom is one with the Mystery of Sex is intimated 
    in the Law itself...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not to be supposed, the union 
    of humanity below--being in its consecration a reflection of the Divine Union--that 
    there should not be a union of souls in the world to come, that in the beauty 
    of the true region of Life they should not continue to reflect the Supernal 
    Mystery... What is understood is the union in heaven of souls who have been 
    espoused on earth--being those who were espoused previously before the world 
    began. When it is said that the Blessed Vision is the sight of the Shekinah 
    and the contemplation of Her Divine Face, we are to understand that the union 
    of all sister-souls is under her eyes and in her presence. It is said that 
    in the heights of heaven there is yet another union of two born of love and 
    for ever inseparable. </font><b>The Holy Kabbalah</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
