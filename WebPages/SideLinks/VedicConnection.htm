<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">VEDIC CREATION MYTH...The <i>Rig Veda</i> is a collection 
    of more than a thousand hymns composed in northwest India about 1500BC, in 
    an archaic form of Sanskrit, an ancient Indo-European language. In addition 
    to this canon, numerous myths appear in commentaries composed a few centuries 
    later and known as the <i>Brahmanas</i>. These texts were not committed to 
    writing for many centuries after their composition, but oral tradition preserved 
    them and later Hindu literature draws heavily upon their characters and events.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The central myth of the <i>Rig Veda</i> is the myth of creation. 
    This is described in several different ways. Often the universe is said to 
    have come into being OUT OF CHAOS, <font size="3">(compare Genesis 1:2)</font>, 
    when a god--Indra, king of the gods and god of rain, or Vishnu, a solar deity--SEPARATED 
    HEAVEN FROM EARTH. <font size="3">(East from West, see Genesis 10:25)</font>. 
    Then the Sun arose AND FROM THAT SPOT, THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH, A GREAT PILLAR 
    WAS ERECTED TO PROP APART HEAVEN AND EARTH. THIS PILLAR IS THE AXIS OF THE 
    WORLD.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg152.gif" width="480" height="169"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">THERE WERE NOW THREE WORLDS: HEAVEN <font size="3">(The East)</font>, 
    EARTH <font size="3">(The West)</font>, AND THE INTERVENING <font size="3">(Middle 
    Earth, the Sea, where the Great Dragon, Leviathan, lay hidden)</font>. Vishnu 
    is said to measured out (and thus, in the Vedic view, to have created) these 
    three worlds with three great strides. <font size="3">(The last two are recorded 
    at Revelation 10:2)</font>. Although there are some obscure hints of an underworld, 
    little is said about this part of the universe in the <i>Rig Veda</i>. The 
    Sun travels below the earth at night to return to the east by morning, and 
    this mirror-image world (a world of brightness) is ruled by Varuna, (the Clear-Bright 
    Sky)... </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under 
      his Feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire </font></i><font size="+1">(Sefirot)<i> 
      stone, and as it were the Body of Heaven in his clearness...</i>(Exodus 
      24:10).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">Second to the Vedic creation myths in importance and frequency 
    are the myths of the eternal battle between gods and demons....In the <i>Rig 
    Veda</i>, the demons are often confused with the human enemies of the...Indo 
    Aryans, and Indra as king of the gods simultaneously defeats the human foes, 
    destroys the threatening demons and sets free the creative power of the universe. 
    The arch-enemy of Indra is Vritra, A GREAT SERPENT WHO LIES COILED ABOUT THE 
    WORLD MOUNTAIN AT THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH, holding back the waters. Indra pierces 
    Vritra, lets loose the rains and shatters the mountains. This act sets free 
    the cows (the Feminine principle) who were kept prisoner in the World-Mountain, 
    and released the Sun (the True Light), which was held fast within the Rock 
    of the underworld night. The slaughter of the dragon </font>(understand the 
    symbolism here, see chapter Three)<font size="+1">, is an act of creation 
    as well as destruction, yet another way of firmly establishing and steadying 
    Heaven and Earth in their proper places. </font>Mythology, An Illustrated

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are 
    all children, and there is no such thing as an old Greek. 'What do you mean 
    by that?' inquired Solon. 'You are all young in mind,' came the reply: 'you 
    have no belief rooted in the old tradition, and no knowledge hoary with age. 
    And the reason is this. There have been and will be many different calamities 
    to destroy mankind, the greatest of them by fire and water, lesser ones by 
    countless other means. Your own story of how Phaethon, child of the sun, harnessed 
    his father's chariot, but was unable to guide it along his father's course 
    and so burnt up things on the earth and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt, 
    is a mythical version of the truth that there is at long intervals a variation 
    in the course of heavenly and a consequent widespread destruction by fire 
    of things on the earth…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our records tell how your city 
    checked a great power which arrogantly advanced from its base in the Atlantic 
    ocean to attack the cities of Europe and Asia. For in those days the Atlantic 
    was navigable. There was an island (a continent), opposite the strait which 
    you call (so you say) the Pillars of Hercules, an island larger than Libya 
    and Asia combined; from it travelers in those days could reach the other islands, 
    and from them the whole opposite continent which surrounds what can truly 
    be called the ocean. For the sea within the strait we are talking about is 
    like a lake with a narrow entrance; the outer ocean is the real ocean and 
    the land which entirely surrounds it is properly termed continent. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On this island of Atlantis had 
    risen a powerful and remarkable dynasty of kings, who ruled the whole island, 
    and many other islands as well and parts of the continent; in addition it 
    controlled within the strait, Libya (Africa) up to the borders of Egypt and 
    Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This dynasty, gathering its whole power together, 
    attempted to enslave at a single stroke, your country and ours and all the 
    territory within the strait… At a later time there was earthquakes and floods 
    of extraordinary violence, and in a single dreadful day and night all your 
    fighting men were swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis was 
    similarly swallowed up by the sea and vanished; this is why the sea in that 
    area is to this day impassable to navigation, which is hindered by mud just 
    below the surface, the remains of a sunken island.&quot; (see Job 41:30).</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">

<p><font size="+1">Thus we would see that all the hymns of the Rig Veda, which 
  sing the praises of the Only One God, but in Their various manifestations as 
  Agni and Indra, as Mitra and Varuna, find their meanings in the events of those 
  Atlantean wars that were waged between the sons of Darkness (the children of 
  Cain) and the forces of God (the other non-Adamic powers of the earth) in the 
  time of Noah. They also find their meanings in the sentiments of those children 
  of Light who were delivered out of these wars by the exploits of Indra (Great 
  Indra who revealed Himself in the collective form of all the powers of the earth 
  in those times, and then later in the letters of the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, in 
  the time of Moses). The hymns of the Vedas were first composed by these adepts 
  in the world-mystery who appeared at the same time in history as the children 
  of Darkness, but in the spirit of Abel instead of Cain. These <i>ASVINS</i> 
  as they are known in the Rig Veda were the first true monotheists, and therefore 
  the world's first true pacifists. (Every true monotheist must at the same time 
  be, or immediately become a true pacifist, for the very simple reason that the 
  One God is present in all things, and in every human event, and therefore more 
  Terribly Present in those forces that others in God's name so erroneously perceive 
  to be their mortal enemies...see Romans 13:1-5). Thus these <i>Asvins</i> (these 
  sons of Seth, and later Shem) came into the East out of the Northwest, not as 
  warring conquerors in the literal sense but as peaceful people (peaceful warriors) 
  fleeing the ravages of war itself. They will become the forerunners of those 
  orders of Rishis and Maruts (those Merkabah mystics), who will return to the 
  center of this great Mystery again in the time of Abraham, and then again in 
  the time of Christ:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Indian historical tradition 
    without any doubt or difficulty accepts the antiquity of the Vedas. It accepts 
    the date of Rgveda Samhita to be 4500 B.C. as determined by Tilak and the 
    composition of some of its earlier hymns as going back to 6500 B.C. or even 
    to greater antiquity. </font>(This protraction of historical events, beyond 
    the time of Adam about 120 Jubilees, or roughly 6,000 years ago, is a common 
    practice among some native historians in their attempts to rescue their own 
    histories from the hands of Western scholarship and even from the Western 
    tradition itself. Nevertheless, the author goes on to say):</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Indian historical tradition 
    as handed down to to us by the Epics, the Puranas, the day-to-day utterance 
    of the Sankalpa, show that Salivahana era did start from 78 A.D. and that 
    the Kaliyuga started from 3102-1 B.C. The Yudhisthirabda...is still being 
    observed in Kashmir. That it starts from 3076 B.C. is unquestionably accepted 
    by the Indian people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the advent of Western Indologists 
    on the scene has distorted beyond all imagination all these beliefs so far 
    held by the Indians. Max Muller's determination of Indian chronology...now 
    holds the field. But that this contradicts their own discoveries is now becoming 
    more and more apparent. The consensus is now evolving among the Western Indologists 
    including Wheeler about the date of the Indus Valley civilization as about 
    3100 B.C. or even earlier. Their pet-theory about the hordes of the Aryan 
    invaders coming down on the peace-loving Indus Valley people in their chariots 
    about 1800 B.C. and destroying their civilization by arson, loot and murder 
    has no support either in literature or in archaeology. In passing, one can 
    note here that the passes in the Hindukush and Karakoram ranges on the Indo-Afghan 
    border, are even today unsafe for chariots to cross. It is difficult to believe 
    that the 'Aryan invaders' entered through these passes with their chariots 
    in those remote days. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Indian indologists...are accepting 
    the Bharata war as a historical event which took place around the beginning 
    of the Kali era starting from 3102-1 B.C..These assumptions necessarily take 
    the date of the Rgveda Samhita at least a few centuries prior to the start 
    of the Kali era. It will be seen how the Rgveda itself proves that the Vedic 
    people belonged to THE SAPTA--Sindu Pradesha, i.e. present day Pakistan and 
    the Punjab and Kashmira states of Bharata and some regions west of the river 
    Sindhu extending up to the Caspian Sea and Caucasus and Pamir mountains, and 
    the question of 'Aryan' invasion of Bharata is nothing but a figment of imagination 
    of these indologists.&quot; </font>Bhishma's Study of Indian History and Culture,
