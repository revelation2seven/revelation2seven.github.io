  RECLAIMING HOPE: THE PEACE MOVEMENT AFTER THE WAR</font> </div>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bombs that fell on Iraq shattered 
  the armies of Saddam Hussein and the bodies of five to ten thousand civilians. 
  They also crushed the spirits of many in the peace movement, driving participants 
  into their shells. In the months before the war, several million ordinary Americans 
  marched and spoke out to challenge it, joined by the largest global peace demonstrations 
  in history. Then we watched the war on TV, or read about it in the papers, and 
  felt hopeless and powerless. Many of us wonder now whether our actions can matter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Because so many citizens marched, 
  vigiled, lobbied, and otherwise raised our voices, we felt like we might stop 
  the war. An amazing movement bloomed, seemingly out of nowhere. Then Bush invaded 
  nonetheless. And many of us sank into despair. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;I 
  did everything I could,&#148; a Minnesota college student told me recently. 
  &#147;I wrote letters and called Congressmen. I marched and held signs. So many 
  other people did too. Then Bush said he wouldn&#146;t listen no matter what 
  we did. I felt all our efforts were worthless.&#148; The student was young, 
  but people thirty years older expressed the same demoralization&#151;a sense 
  of futility and dashed hopes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This response risks creating a self-fulfilling 
  prophecy where a movement that may still be our best hope to transform America 
  dissipates in resignation. To move past the despair many of us are feeling, 
  we&#146;re going to need to look at its roots. And then gain enough long-term 
  perspective to remind us why our actions still matter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Think back to the war. Arrogant 
  men of power will always deny that those who challenge them are affecting their 
  actions. But when Bush dismissed the massive protests as no more consequential 
  than a poll-manipulated focus group, it was a calculated attempt to make people 
  feel powerless. Then the attack began, presented by America&#146;s TV networks 
  as a mix of Fourth of July spectacle and Super Bowl cheerleading. Unless we 
  tuned to the BBC, we rarely saw the human carnage, just endless glorification 
  of U.S. technical might. When Iraqis resisted, against all odds, our reporters 
  dismissed them as &#147;fanatics.&#148; They accepted without question the transformation 
  of British and American troops into &#147;coalition forces,&#148; as if the 
  whole world stood by our side, like a child with an army of imaginary friends. 
  We were told again and again that America fought only for freedom and that even 
  to question would betray our brave young soldiers. As a friend said, &#147;I 
  feel all I can do is watch, but watching makes it worse.&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When the bombs were falling, it 
  was hard to know what to hope for, much less what to advocate. And harder still 
  to feel you could have an influence. The longer the war lasted and the more 
  resistance, the more US soldiers&#151;and Iraqis--would die or be wounded. Our 
  troops didn&#146;t start the war. We wanted them safe from harm. We also didn&#146;t 
  want to see casualties among ordinary Iraqis, whether civilians or the young 
  soldiers who believed they were fighting for their country. It tore us apart 
  to go about our daily lives while children were being torn apart by American 
  bombs. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also worried about 
  the costs of a quick US victory--the risk of feeding more interventions, more 
  &#147;preemptive&#148; wars, and more imperial arrogance. We feared that this 
  war would not be the last that the Bush administration would wage. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With the war now over, many of our 
  predictions have proved correct. Looters and fundamentalist Shiites have dominated 
  the post-Saddam landscape. Despite justified relief about the collapse of Saddam 
  Hussein&#146;s brutal rule, most Iraqis have not welcomed us with cheers, but 
  with hesitation and mistrust. Our attacks provoked riots throughout the Islamic 
  world, from Egypt and Pakistan to Indonesia and Malaysia. Weapons of mass destruction 
  still have not been found, and may never be. Contracts are being handed out 
  like Halloween candy to Republican-linked companies like Haliburton and Bechtel, 
  equal-opportunity dealers who had no problems dancing with Saddam Hussein when 
  he was in power, Haliburton as recently as three years ago. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The global peace movement may have 
  actually helped pressure the US military to limit what they called &#147;collateral 
  damage,&#148; as they scaled down the initial plans for the massive bombardment 
  they called &#147;shock &amp; awe.&#148; Now, placed in what psychiatrist Robert 
  Jay Lifton called, during Vietnam, &#147;an atrocity-creating situation,&#148; 
  our scared young soldiers have responded to suicide bombers and snipers by shooting 
  up cars full of women and children and firing on unarmed demonstrators. Given 
  the occupation&#146;s continuing chaos and the developing bitterness of ordinary 
  Iraqis, our troops stand to be vulnerable targets for years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But watching the complications unfold 
  hasn&#146;t helped peace movement morale. During the war itself, communities 
  that had massive demonstrations just a few weeks before saw the numbers of those 
  visibly protesting quickly melt away. Although public witness remained critically 
  important, we wanted to do more, even to stop the bombs physically. We wanted 
  the power to immediately prevent the destructive actions that were unfolding, 
  but within the war&#146;s abbreviated timeframe, that was something we couldn&#146;t 
  do. As a result, many who&#146;d just recently felt a massive common strength, 
  quickly felt isolated and confused, and have remained so. It&#146;s not that 
  we bought into the administration&#146;s propaganda juggernaut, or do now that 
  the war is over. But it&#146;s hard to know how to challenge it, especially 
  in an atmosphere that attacks even the mildest dissent as allegiance to terrorism. 
  And without the clear focus of working to prevent a looming war, it&#146;s now 
  harder to define our common tasks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As conservative pundits talk glibly 
  of moving on to Syria and Iran, we might start with questioning the ethic of 
  arrogance that would make this war just a first step toward a new imperial America, 
  at home and abroad. On the eve of the war, an army mother from El Paso, Texas, 
  wrote to me, describing why she&#146;d began attending peace vigils. She prayed 
  every night for the safety of her son and the others in his unit. &#147;I have 
  no doubts,&#148; she wrote, &#147;about our military and the job it can do. 
  But does that make it right and just? I know that Saddam is an evil dictator 
  but he is but one in a long list, and I worry that this administration will 
  not want to stop with just him. I heard Bill Bennett on TV last night and he 
  was actually grinning and saying that we were a superpower and we have every 
  right to show our might. What happened to &#145;being humble&#146;?&#148;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We need to challenge a view that 
  we our leaders can do whatever they choose without consequence, simply because 
  they have the power. After the UN didn&#146;t support the Bush administration 
  on Iraq, the Bush administration attacked anyway, then spurned post-war international 
  control, leaving our troops as visible occupiers, exposed to attack, blamed 
  for continued disorder, and inflaming the Islamic world with their presence. 
  Whenever treaties on global warming, tobacco use, child labor, ballistic missiles, 
  or landmines threaten to place limits on corporate or military power, the administration 
  undermines them or withdraws, even though this unilateralism makes it impossible 
  for the world to address our most urgent common problems. If the rich want more 
  tax breaks, it doesn&#146;t matter that the funds come out of domestic education, 
  health and social welfare budgets, even the programs that serve military families. 
  Those making these decisions assume that they will have no costs, or none to 
  anyone who matters. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We need to challenge this politics 
  of denial and contempt, and offer alternatives that honor our common ties: working 
  with other nations, respecting communities at home, treating democracy as more 
  than just a rhetorical cloak for bullying and greed. To do this effectively, 
  we can begin by working to re-involve those millions of ordinary citizens, who, 
  despite all the polls, do not believe the Bush administration&#146;s actions, 
  whether at home or abroad, have made the world safer, more democratic, or more 
  humane. For the moment, many have grown quiet&#151;isolated, intimidated, and 
  demoralized. But this past year, so many people got involved&#151;either again 
  or for the first time--they could form the core of the largest American peace 
  and justice movement in decades. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Powerful journeys can emerge out 
  of bleak times. The first local NAACP meeting attended by Rosa Parks, a dozen 
  years before her stand on the Montgomery bus, addressed one of America&#146;s 
  own buried legacies of terror, the persistence of lynching. We also never know 
  what some of those just coming into involvement may end up accomplishing. In 
  the early 1960s, a friend of mine named Lisa took two of her kids to a Washington, 
  DC, vigil in front of the White House, protesting nuclear testing. The vigil 
  was small, a hundred women at most. Rain poured down. The women felt frustrated 
  and powerless. A few years later, the movement against testing had grown dramatically, 
  and Lisa attended a major march. Benjamin Spock, the famous baby doctor, spoke. 
  He described how he'd come to take a stand, which because of his stature had 
  influenced thousands, and would continue to after his early opposition to the 
  Vietnam War. Spock talked briefly about the issues, then mentioned being in 
  DC a few years before and seeing a small group of women marching, with their 
  kids, in the pouring rain. &quot;I thought that if those women were out there,&quot; 
  he said, &quot;their cause must be really important.&quot; As he described the 
  scene and setting, and how much he was moved, Lisa realized that Spock was referring 
  to her soggy group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The movements of this past year 
  may well have brought into involvement the next Ben Spock, the next Rosa Parks, 
  the next Martin Luther King. But the tide of new citizen activists will matter 
  only if we can find ways to re-involve them. A prime task, therefore, has to 
  be connecting with those people who participated at the periphery of the movement 
  but melted away when the war began: the neighbor who displayed a peace sign; 
  the co-worker who went to a march or candle-light vigil; the friend who raised 
  hesitations. We need to validate their impulse to participate to begin with, 
  listen to their concerns, refer them to groups that are acting. We need to give 
  them ways to reclaim their voice, and begin reaching out again in their communities. 
  Just the process of working to raise issues together will help us recover some 
  of our sense of power, because nothing is more depressing than watching the 
  bad news in withdrawal and silence. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We have powerful potential allies 
  institutionally as well as individually. The recent movement brought together 
  key organizations and voices of conscience in ways that didn&#146;t remotely 
  occur even at the height of the opposition to the Vietnam War. The Win Without 
  War coalition joined the National Council of Churches, the Sierra Club, the 
  NAACP, the National Organization for Women, national peace groups, major union 
  leaders, and cyberactivists like www.moveon.org and Working Assets. We saw strong 
  peace statements from every major Catholic leader and the heads of every major 
  mainline Protestant denomination except the Southern Baptists. ACLU memberships 
  have soared in the wake of the Patriot Act&#146;s gross invasion of the most 
  basic elements of privacy. If these institutions and institutional leaders can 
  keep working together, they can offer powerful ways to create a common voice. 
  Add in a continuing global peace movement, and we have a powerful base for change.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Making progress on any of these 
  issues will be vastly easier, of course, if we can get George Bush out of office. 
  Many peace, justice, and environmental activists are already shifting gears 
  to begin working toward this end. Many are backing the more progressive Democratic 
  candidates, like Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich. Some are supporting other 
  contenders, like Richard Gephardt and John Kerry. (Though Gephardt&#146;s support 
  of the war and Kerry&#146;s waffling hardly make this an easy task, either would 
  be far better than Bush in a dozen key ways if they got in.) Others are focusing 
  on registering disengaged voters, and on beginning anew to talk about issues 
  buried beneath Bush&#146;s media whitewashing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At some point we&#146;ll be left 
  with no choice but to back the last Democratic standing, or tacitly help Bush 
  get reelected. No matter who the Democratic nominee is in 2004, the Republican 
  agenda is ruthless and regressive enough, and the Bush electoral machine so 
  efficient, that we can&#146;t afford Green Party diversions. We have to be united 
  in voting, helping get out the vote, and doing whatever we can. But between 
  now and November 2004, it will be our energies that do or don&#146;t build both 
  the grassroots movement that can hold Bush accountable for his actions and the 
  political context that can give us a chance to defeat him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We live, alas, in a time of lies. 
  If we stay silent, they build up like mud piling in front of a door. The deeper 
  the mud, the harder it is to dig out from it. So we need to find ways to help 
  our fellow citizens recognize how little this administration has ever cared 
  about democracy, and how much about its own power. And how that power makes 
  both individuals and communities expendable, whether American troops deployed 
  in the Gulf, Iraqi civilians killed by our bombs, or ordinary citizens living 
  in communities seeing cuts in every institution that serves the poor and vulnerable&#151;and 
  even the middle class, as teachers get laid off from all but the most affluent 
  public schools. We need to start local dialogues about our choices and priorities, 
  who wins and who loses, and the long-term implications of everything from waging 
  preemptive war, to ignoring global warming, to transferring unprecedented amounts 
  of money from the poorest to the wealthiest. We have to start those dialogues 
  now and with people who don&#146;t necessarily agree with us. We need to give 
  our fellow citizens the courage not to just duck and cover when told they&#146;ve 
  no right to speak out, and stand by those who are attacked. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Finally, we need to persist. The 
  roots of the Iraq war go back decades, from the &#147;Southern Strategy&#148; 
  that handed the Republicans so much political power to the US role in bringing 
  Saddam Hussein and his Baathist party to power to begin with. These roots won&#146;t 
  be instantly untangled. If we look just at the past few months, we didn&#146;t 
  win what we hoped. We didn&#146;t stop the war. But we were never in it only 
  to stop just a single war, but to redirect this country down paths that treat 
  the world with respect. Immediately, we need to do whatever we can between now 
  and November of 2004 to elect a different president. But we also have to be 
  in this for the long haul. If we act with enough courage, and persevere long 
  enough in raising the real and difficult issues, the turnings of history may 
  surprise us in powerful and hopeful ways. Despite the Bush administration&#146;s 
  insistence to the contrary, we are far from alone in this task.</font></p>
