  <b>Michael,<br>
  Do you have a book with all this work you have on the net. Also, Could you please 
  share some light on the following:</b></p>
<p><b>Sabbath - should it be Saturday, Sunday or ........... what is it?.<br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Dear Friend...</b></p>
<p align="center"><b><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif" width="650" height="472"><br>
  </b> </p>
<p> <b>The Sabbath, of course, is the Seventh day. We are only now arriving at 
  the greater meaning of it all...It has been a long journey...Genesis 2:1-3; 
  Hebrews 3:12 to 4:12. <br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Concerning the individual sabbaths that men have been observing, from one 
  end of history to the other: Paul (the great expositor of the Torah) writes:</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of 
    an holyday, or of a new moon, OR THE SABBATH DAYS: WHICH ARE A SHADOW OF THINGS 
    TO COME, but the Body is Christ...</i><b>(Colossians 2:16,17)</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth 
    or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.<br>
    <br>
    One man esteemeth one day above another (perhaps Sunday, the beginning of 
    this epic mystery, or perhaps Saturday, the end of it), another esteemeth 
    every day alike. Let every soul be fully persuaded in his own mind. <br>
    <br>
    He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth 
    not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to 
    the Lord, for he giveth God thanks: and he that eateth not, to the Lord he 
    eateth not, and giveth God thanks...</i><b>(Romans 14:1-7).</b><br>
    <br>
    <i>Stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, 
    and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage...</i><b>(Galatians 5:1)</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>(Of course we must all observe the Great Seventh Day).</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Offering - burnt, peace,meat etc.</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you 
    bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle 
    , even of the herd, and of the flock.<br>
    <br>
    If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male (from 
    the solar side of the Tree of Life) without blemish: HE SHALL OFFER IT OF 
    HIS OWN VOLUNTARY WILL AT THE DOOR of the tabernacle of the congregation...</i><b>(Leviticus 
    1:2,3)</b>.</p>

<p align="left"><b>John said, I baptise you with water...but in the future...ye 
  shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with Fire..(Matthew 3:1-12). <br>
  <br>
  There are many ways for a soul to be baptized, by Water, by Fire, but also by 
  Desire (a desire for God and for the things of God) and by Persecution. The 
  Heart of God is not connected to rituals per se, but by the orientation of the 
  heart and mind. Many who are last now shall be first soon. <br>

  <p><i>In that day Seven Women (the church and all the religious among them) 
    shall take hold of one Man (the Messiahs of David...Zechariah 4), saying, 
    We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called 
    by thy name, to take away our reproach.<br>
    <br>
    In that day shall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the 
    fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped 
    of Israel...</i><b>(Isaiah 4:1,2)</b>.</p>

<p><b>Thank You<br>

<p><b>P.S. I have this work broken up into several books, any of which you are 
  welcome to come and make a copy of. (Or if you live somewhere that I can get 
  to sometime, I usually have most of them with me). It is my hope that someday 
  the means will appear that will allow us to make as many copies as we can, to 
  be given away to those who want them. I leave those matters to the Spirit. Mike</b>.

  What you have shared is very, very interesting but it is a very hard read. Do 
  you happen to have a type of &quot;readers digest&quot; version for your slower 
  brothers in the Lord? I believe God has called me to study what you are sharing 
  and please do not be offended in what I ask but I really want to understand 
  what you are teaching but I do not think I catch it all if you understand what 
  I mean? Please forgive me if I have made you mad because this is not my intent. 
  I just want to learn more about our Lord. Thanks so much for your work and trouble 
  if you answer me. Rev Mickey Banks </b></p>

<p><b>Dear Rev. Banks,<br>
  Thank you for your reply. And yes, I am aware of the weight of these studies, 
  and have searched for ways to break it all down as simply as possible. It speaks 
  I hope to those who have either already given themselves to the study of the 
  ancient mysteries, and already know something of the discipline of Kabbalah, 
  or who are just now searching for the key that opens up our minds to the spiritual 
  realities that are unfolding in the world at this time. <br>
  <br>
  I would say that once one grasps the initial premise--the fact that the ancient 
  garden of Eden is here in America, and that God has brought history full-circle 
  back to the beginning again (to cause us to see if we have indeed learned the 
  difference between good and evil (between the spirit of Christ and antiChrist 
  and between the doctrines of God and the doctrines of men); but also to allow 
  us a glimpse into the Face of God itself. God is Terribly and Magestically risen 
  in the earth now, in the sum of every Natural and Human event. It is the Third 
  Day. The Prophets were explicit in their sense of the direction history would 
  take--Westward--and that when we came to these fulness of times all the mysteries 
  of Heaven and Earth would be revealed. If you have seen the countenance of the 
  Great Dragon (the Leviathan) then you are well on your way to putting the rest 
  of the pieces of the puzzle together on your own. Once you see it you can understand 
  why the Zionist State of Israel is at the center of all the things that are 
  unfolding in the world at this time (and why America--the other Zionist state--is 
  so fatefully involved in it all), because in the Zionist movement's attempt 
  to return to the &quot;Promised Land&quot; and to establish a nation called 
  Israel (without waiting on the true Messiahs) it literally went &quot;backwards&quot; 
  away from the course history, to a land that is not theirs, and never was. The 
  true (Torah observant) Jews (the most orthodox of all Jews) are still waiting 
  here in New York City for the coming of Messiah. (Please understand chapter 
  10). They are anti-Zionists and have renounced the very existence of the state 
  of Israel. Well anyway, that is a good place to begin. In the meantime, please 
  stay in touch, and Peace and Love to all of you...Mike.<br>

<p><b>Michael, <br>
  Please do not think small of me but many of the terms and saying you use are 
  very foreign to me. I was rised Catholic and now I am a Protestant (non-denominational). 
  I know I ask for a &quot;readers digest&quot; version of your writing and I 
  was not trying to be funny but these concepts you share are very, very different 
  from anything I have ever heard. I humbly ask that you help me understand what 
  you are teaching? I hope you are a man of God. Would you please e-mail me back 
  so I would know if you are getting these e-mails? Thank you so much. Rev. Mickey
