<p align="center"><b>...SO SOLVING FOR X (THE NUMBER 666), IS:</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/666Equation.gif" width="257" height="103"></p>
<p><font face=Arial>The name Solomon is derived from the Hebrew word Shalom, meaning 
  peace, but has then been translated in the King James version as an alchemical 
  amalgam of <i>sol</i> (sun), and <i>omon</i> (moon).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial>Alchemy, as it emerged in the Middle Ages, had its origins 
  in the Hermetic sciences that stemmed from the esoteric wisdom of ancient Egypt.The 
  ancient Egyptian name for their land was Kemet, from which we get the words 
  chemistry and alchemy. The esoteric Judaic tradition seen in the Kabbalah is 
  also thought to have derived some of its concepts from Egyptian beliefs....</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg138a.gif" width="527" height="237"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Where also our Lord was crucified...(Revelation 11:8).</b></p>
<p><font face=Arial>In alchemy the sun and the moon expressed archetypal principles, 
  which, when united, symbolised the harmonious relationship between the masculine 
  and feminine elements.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial>Gold in alchemy, represents the purified spirit and is also 
  traditionally associated with the sun. The year, of course, relates to the solar 
  cycle, so there is a suggestion in the Biblical quote from Kings of a link between 
  the number <b>666</b> and the sun.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in ONE 
    YEAR was Six Hundred Threescore and Six talents of gold...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Kings 8:14).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face=Arial>Coincidentally, the first six Roman numerals written in their 
  correct descending order (DCLXVI) represent <b>666</b>:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><u><img src="../../UsedImages/666Roman.gif" width="82" height="148"></u></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">666</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">While the number 666 could be an allusion to the Roman authorities, 
  who were responsible for the crucifixion (and to the Roman religion in particular, 
  which has been responsible for the death of millions of true believers throughout 
  the centuries), the number is much more expansive and reveals much more than 
  that. It is on its own symbolic journey to the Western ends of the earth, and 
  to the words at Revelation 13:18.</font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36</font></b></p>
<p><font face=Arial>The magic square of the sun has the curious property that 
  if all the numbers between 1 and 36 are added together the total is <strong>666</strong>.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face=Arial size=-1>The number <b>666 </b>also emerged in another context- 
    through the number symbolism of magic squares. As John Michell pointed out 
    in his book View Over Atlantis the magic square of the sun contains all the 
    numbers from 1 to 36 and is laid out as follows:</font></p>

  = 111</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font face=Arial size=-1>Sum of numbers of perimeter

<p><font face=Arial>The factors of <b>666</b> are 2 x 3 x 3 x 37 or 18 x 37. The 
  number 37 has the unusual properties that many of its multiples have repeated 
  digits:...</font><font face=Arial>Of its factors, the numbers 111 and 370 are 
  woven into the magic square of the sun and the number 18 (18 x 37 = 666) may 
  also have been seen as significant because this number is the sum of 6 + 6 + 
  6.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus: The Sun behind the sun...The 
    number of the physical world is Six, the number of the spiritual world is 
    Eight. 600 is the number of Cosmos, (The word K O S M O S in Greek adds up 
    to the number 600), while 800 is the number of the Lord (K Y R I O S) of the 
    Cosmos. Similarly the number of Jesus, 888, the Spiritual Sun, is contrasted 
    with the number 666, that of the physical sun. </font>(Please see the chapter 
    on the Name of Jesus)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In geometry, it is the figure of 
    the Cube which unites the number Six and Eight. That is because the Cube has 
    six sides and eight corners. </font>(Thus it is just a slight shift in consciousness 
    between the mind of Antichrist and the mind of Christ)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God created the world in Six days 
    and rested on the Seventh, which was a Saturday. Christ rose from the dead 
    on a Sunday which, for the early Christians became the Eighth day, symbolizing 
    the new, spiritual creation and the regeneration of time. </font>(By now we 
    should be able to immediately associate this number with the sefira named 
    Majesty, or Hod, on the Tree of Life)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The number 8, the ogdoad, symbolizes the new order, and Jesus, 888, was known 
    as the Ogdoad to the early Christian gnostics.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the illustration on the left 
    (above) a Cube is shown in isometric projection. Six rays emanate from a Seventh, 
    inner point...Viewed from another perspective on the right, we can see that 
    there is more to the other arrangement than meets the eye. Here the Seventh 
    hidden ray is revealed, as is the Eighth point, the hidden Spiritual Sun from 
    which all things flow..</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the gnostics, most 
    people are asleep and do not realize that there exists a higher, spiritual 
    reality; it is though they see the illustration on the Left, take it at face 
    value, and assume there is nothing more. Through the faculty of gnosis, however, 
    it is possible for the higher reason (logos) to discern the existence of a 
    more inclusive reality--the Sun behind the sun.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The literal-minded, like the proponents 
    of materialism, see the world through the one diagram and see no further; 
    literalism reads the letter of the law but does not grasp its spirit; materialism 
    holds matter to be the only reality, but does not see that it is merely the 
    effects of a higher cause. Those with the spark of gnosis, however, catch 
    an occasional glimpse of the higher pattern--the Universal Logos, the intelligent 
    pattern of order and harmony which informs all existence. <font size="2">Jesus

<p align="center"><b>SYMBOLISM OF THE NUMBER 37</b></p>
<p align="center">www.aiwaz.net<br>
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Pythagoras and Plato 37 was 
    a holy number, and maybe they got it from Egypt. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Pythagorean triangle with 
    sideunits 3, 4 and 5, the angle from the bottom up to the top is 37 degrees. 
    The side in the triangle with 5 units is symbolizing the &quot;path of return&quot;, 
    it is rising up from the bottom of the triangle and back to the source from 
    where everything came out in existence. So 37 is pointing the way back to 
    The Father and the Source. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus, with the greek gematrian 
    value 888, is 37 x 24. Christ =1480 = 37 x 40, and so on. There is a lot of 
    37 both in the Old and the New testament. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 is also like a &quot;cosmic 
    key&quot;, causing the existence to move on from level to level: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 x 3 (1+1+1) = 111</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 x 6 (2+2+2) = 222</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 x 9 (3+3+3) = 333</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 x 12(4+4+4) = 444</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 x 15(5+5+5) = 555</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 x 18(6+6+6) = 666</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 x 21(7+7+7) = 777</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 x 24(8+8+ = 888</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 x 27(9+9+9) = 999</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    So Man is developing from 666 (= &quot;the Beast&quot;, the physical/emotional/mental 
    body and earthly existence), through 777 (completion and also greek gematrian 
    value for cross/stauros), and 888 (transcendence and greek gematrian value 
    for Jesus), up to the Father, the spiritual fullness and heaven in 999. This 
    happens through the work of 37.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">37 has also several other meanings, 
    for instance a hexagon can consist of 36 + 1 = 37 units. The unit in the centre 
    of the hexagon is number 37 and symbolizes the spiritual seed or Higher Self/ 
    Christ Consciousness, surrounded by 36 other units (1+2+3+4+...36 = 666 = 
    the physical world). </font></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">if you take any number with three 
    digits and permutate it, then add all of them you get the sum which is always 
    a multiple of 37. Example with 486:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">486<br>
    468<br>
    648<br>
    684<br>
    846<br>
    864<br>
