<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All Christian nations must be &quot;twice-born,&quot; 
    but since Grace transforms nature rather than destroys it, they carry deep 
    within them traces of their heathen past. The process of transformation is 
    never complete...perhaps this tincture of native heathendom accounts primarily 
    for the characteristic national features of Christianity...Christianity was 
    incorporated into each nation by undergoing a kind of adaptation to, or investment 
    of the pre-Christian legacies which hide in the subconscious of the national 
    soul...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Russians are no exception. 
    With them the tie between Christian and Pre-Christian elements is perhaps 
    still stronger than in most nations of the West...Russia did not know either 
    the Reformation or the Counter-Reformation with their cleansing, spiritualizing, 
    and sweeping out of medieval superstitions. The Russian peasant had been living 
    in the Middle Ages throughout the nineteenth century. Many an author has said, 
    after personal contact, that the Russians are the most religious people of 
    Europe. But it is rather the difference of age rather than of the quality 
    of mind or culture. The same historical reasons which had preserved religious 
    freshness in the Russian folk in the midst of an age of rationalism also kept 
    many elements of heathen customs, heathen cults, and even heathen world-view 
    in a state of good preservation both in and out of the Christian Church. Therefore 
    an acquaintance with Russian paganism is an important preliminary for understanding 
    Russian Christianity.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HISTORICAL 
      BACKGROUND</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No fixed boundaries ever existed 
    between Slavic and neighboring peoples. In the process of continuous colonization 
    of new territories, Slavic tribes fused easily with the aborigines. The influence 
    which had been mutual since prehistoric times appeared in language, customs, 
    and anthropological types. The northern Great Russian, that is, the Russian 
    in a narrow sense as distinct from the Ukranian and White Russian, in his 
    physical outlook is a product of both the Slavic and Finnish races. The infiltration 
    and blending of the newcomers with the Finnish aborigines was mostly a peaceful 
    process...But with the inhabitants of the southern steppes, that is, the nomads, 
    the struggle never ceased. The annals of ancient Kievan Russia are full of 
    wars or rather of one continual war against Turkish nomads...The Russian folk 
    epics, even in the last centuries, lived on the legendary glory of these campaigns. 
    The southern Russians, however, were also touched by oriental influences, 
    especially since, in spite of the Nomadic character of the population, the 
    northern coasts of the Black Sea were saturated with ancient culture. The 
    girdle of Greek colonies surrounded it from the Danube to the Caucasus, and 
    the Byzantine emperors still possessed many towns in the Crimea...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beneath the Graeco-Roman civilization, 
    another cultural current, and a more ancient one, connected the Russian steppes 
    with Asia, through the Iranian nomads. Assyro-Babylonian and particularly 
    Persian influences can still be clearly read on archaeological relics. Iranianism 
    was the first traceable cultural element in these areas which was preparing 
    the soil for the future Russian state on the Dnieper River. </font>(Please 
    understand the figure of the Medes, and their prophetic association with modern 
    Russia, and their involvement in the judgments of Babylon in both the books 
    of Jeremiah and Daniel, in the light of these things...Jeremiah 50 and 51; 
    Daniel, chapter 6)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, the northern 
    Slavs, whose main center was Novgorod...were harassed by the inroads of Norsemen, 
    who inundated the whole of Europe in the ninth century as robber-soldiers, 
    merchants, and founders of kingdoms...Probably about the middle of the eighth 
    century, the Norsemen, or &quot;Varangians&quot; as they were called by Russians 
    and Greeks, appeared on the Black Sea and began their inroads upon Constantinople...They 
    tied the Baltic basin (Novgorod) and the Dnieper-Black Sea basin into the 
    famous &quot;Great Road from the Varangians to the Greeks.&quot; </font>(Thus 
    opening the way for Greek Orthodoxy as the future national Religion in Russia)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    This commercial road, a system of water-ways, was the beginning of the first 
    Russian state.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Varangians were not very numerous, 
    and their expeditions in Russia were not of a violent character. They acted 
    rather as a police force for the native population whose Slavic language, 
    now called Russian, they soon adopted. The Kiev-Varangian dynasty of the Rurikovichi 
    was the first dynasty of Russian princes. From Kiev, in the course of the 
    tenth and the eleventh centuries, they succeeded in uniting all the other 
    Norse principalities and Slavic tribes on the eastern European plain. A powerful 
    though loosely knit state was created which entered into military and diplomatic 
    relations with Byzantium </font>(a Roman, military, but also &quot;Christian?&quot; 
    state)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, as well as with neighbors 
    in the West: Bulgers, Hungarians, Czechs, Poles, and Lithuanians. No natural 
    frontiers delineated the new state, which was geographically shapeless, always 
    moving eastward, and open to the most various cultural influences...The western 
    neighbors of the Russians were heathens until the tenth century; those on 
    the east were Jews and Moslims. Christianity was coming from the south, from 
    Byzantium. Under these circumstances, the Russian Slavs had no opportunity 
    to develop their primitive paganism into an independent culture...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE 
  ROLE OF NATURE</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nature, of course, is the necessary 
    source of every primitive world view. It is even commonly...accepted that 
    paganism is identical with nature worship. The Russian peculiarity is one 
    of quantity rather than quality. But the quantitative difference is very large...One 
    can hardly imagine any Russian lyrical song without a background of nature, 
    used not merely as a framework or scenery for human drama. A human being...is 
    identified with, rather than (merely) compared to some animal or vegetated 
    being--a bird; a tree; a flower...The destiny of human and animal or vegetated 
    beings are blended in one: they blossom and die together.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In prosaic folk tales, beasts are 
    familiar actors and partakers in human life. Besides the purely animal epic 
    belonging to the common store of mankind there are many Russian stories of 
    animals carrying business with men in a friendly or cunning but rarely mischievous 
    way. In case of conflicts the guilt lies more often on the side of the man 
    than the beast, who represents the less sophisticated and more straightforward 
    moral standard. THE BEAR PARTICULARLY APPEARS AS AN HONEST, EVEN VENERABLE 
    AND MIGHTY BEING. SOME FEATURES IN THE BEAR TALES SUGGEST THE IDEA OF A RELIGIOUS 
    BEAR CULT IN PREHISTORIC TIMES. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the actors in Russian tales 
    one encounters the elementary forces of nature: wind, frost, sun, and moon...The 
    cult of solar deities has left noticeable traces in Russian folklore, particularly 
    in the yearly feast calendar. The days of summer and winter solstices (Saint 
    John and Christmas) are marked by pagan rites which are similar to those of 
    other Indo-European nations. And yet, in spite of the tenets of the traditional 
    school of Russian ethnographers, we venture to say that Russian paganism was 
    perhaps less &quot;solar&quot; than any other in the Aryan religious world...The 
    names of Perun, God of Thunder, and Veles, God of Cattle (or Wealth) are more 
    stable in literary tradition, although not without difficulty of interpretation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These difficulties, however, are 
    beyond our field of interest. What is essential in order to understand specifically 
    Russian features against the western background is to mark the secondary character 
    of celestial deities in Russian paganism. Perhaps this is the reason for the 
    general underdevelopment of Russian mythology. Throughout the world the most 
    plastic and picturesque mythological ideas are connected with the celestial 
    world. The eastern Slav did not look passionately at the night sky, like the 
    Semite in the desert, nor was he particularly struck by the might of the sun, 
    though he used it to celebrate the stages of its annual life by the winter, 
    spring, and summer festivals. His attention was more attracted by the mysteries 
    beneath, by what happened on earth where his personal and tribal life took 
    place...</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE 
      CULT OF MOTHER EARTH</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Mother Earth, who remains the 
    core of Russian religion, converge the most secret and deep religious feelings 
    of the folk. Beneath the veil of grass and flowers, the people venerate with 
    awe the black moist depths, the source of all fertilizing powers, the nourishing 
    breast of nature, and their own last resting place. The very epithet of the 
    earth in the folk songs, &quot;Mother Earth, the Humid,&quot; known also in 
    the Iranian mythology, alludes to the womb rather than to the face of the 
    Earth. It means that not beauty but fertility is the supreme virtue of the 
    earth...Earth is the Russian &quot;Eternal Womanhood,&quot; not the celestial 
    image of it: mother, not virgin; fertile, not pure; and black, for the best 
    Russian soil is black.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a mother who nourishes man during 
    his life and after death gives him rest, the Earth is the embodiment of kindness 
    and mercy. There is, however, something impersonal and generic in her. Unlike 
    the spirits of water and forest, Earth had no indwelling spirits nor was she 
    embodied in human form. She was shapeless as her body under the surface is 
    shapeless. Many myths connected with her are now forgotten, for Christianity 
    succeeded in destroying all traces of sexual associations in the cult of the 
    Earth. Yet, Mother Earth must have had a mate, a celestial god of the Sun 
    or of Thunder. Of this marriage between Earth and Heaven in Russian folklore 
    we know nothing...It is remarkable, however, that Motherhood alone survived 
    through the ages, thereby proving itself stronger than the eroticism of the 
    primitive myth. Speaking in classical terms, this means that in the Russian 
    Earth-goddess, Demeter was more strongly expressed than Aphrodite...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We do not know and shall never 
    know whether Iarilo (a Slavic form of Dionysus) was once the bridegroom of 
    Mother Earth. Nor can it be discovered of Perun, god of thunder. The ancient 
    chroniclers assign to him a place of supreme deity over the Russian Slavs. 
    The conversion to Christianity in Kiev and Novgorod meant, first of all, the 
    breaking of Perun's wooden idols. It is quite possible that the Scandanavian 
    warriors had shaped the Slavic godhead into the image of the Teutonic Thor. 
    Ye once upon a time he was a Slavic god whose former power is attested to, 
    among other remains, by his long survival in the Russian cult of the prophet 
    Elijah, his successor as thunderlord...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no Russian parallel to 
    Athena, or any other Virgin Goddess, and it seems that neither purity nor 
    beauty was essential to the Russian worship of Sacred Womanhood...Mother Earth 
    is shapeless and faceless. The Beauty to which the Russian is so sensitive 
    is not embodied primarily in the woman. Beauty dwells in nature. And the beauty 
    of nature for the Russian is the embracing, the enveloping, rather than the 
    contemplated. Man is lost in nature, unwilling to master her.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hence it follows that the greatest 
    religious temptations for a Russian will be pantheism of a sensual kind. Sacred 
    matter rather than spirit is the object of veneration. Personality is undeveloped, 
    social ties extremely strong, on the basis of blood relationship. Romanticism 
    in any form is basically un-Russian. Sensual mysticism, however, is a necessary 
    complement to the social discipline of the 'rod,' </font>(the ancient ties 
    between the family, the clan, and the tribe)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The spirit of Dionysus </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> is 
    </font>(nevertheless)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> perpetually 
    attempting to infringe upon the laws of Mother Earth. </font>The Russian Religious 
    Mind, pp.3-20<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It was upon, or against this spiritual mindscape that Eastern 
  Christianity came 1,000 years ago, carrying with it the oracles of the Divine 
  Male Principle--Dionysus indeed, the Mystery of Christ, who is not simply the 
  Lord of Nature but the very apotheosis of Nature itself. But this Christ was 
  also one with the Solar Apollo--the Logos, the consort of the Muses, and the 
  inspirer of higher thought-forms in men...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The son of Zeus (the Clear 
    Bright Sky) and Leto (the daughter of the older Titans, or Giants)...He has 
    been called 'the most Greek of all the gods.' He is a beautiful figure in 
    Greek poetry, the master musician who delights Olympus as he plays on his 
    golden lyre: the lord too of the silver bow, the Archer god, far-shooting 
    </font>(the rays of his Solar Presence as he goes)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">; 
    the Healer, as well, who first taught men the healing art. Even more than 
    of these good and lovely endowments, he is the God of Light, in whom is no 
    darkness at all, and so he is the God of Truth. No false word ever falls from 
    his lips. </font>Mythology, by Edith Hamilton, p.30<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This Apollo had already begun his historic journey Westward 
  toward the fulness of these times, and the end of this age. In going, the Lord 
  left to the East that other part of Himself that rules there still--that same 
  primal overshadowing, and all pervading and Terrible force of Nature. </font><font size="+1">What 
  came Westward is that transcendent and perfect part of the Christ-Mystery that 
  neither the Roman, the Greek, nor the Russian orthodox churches--because of 
  their own religious and political attachment to the powers of the earth--could 
  ever comprehend... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Forced and wholesale conversions of the masses (which is the 
  way the great Orthodox Church did business from the time it first took up the 
  bed and the cause of the Roman emperors--a very unholy marriage with the Caesars 
  and later the Czars of the Eastern world), resulted in the mere, almost static 
  superimposition of one system of belief over the other system. A worldly, yet 
  mystical form of Christianity was imposed on top of a more powerful form of 
  (pre-Adamic) paganism which continued to dwell, untouched, just below the surface 
  of the Russian consciousness. But hardly could it result in the real spiritual 
  transformation of the mind of the people themselves. What the Eastern church 
  brought to Russia was a Mystery (indeed, a wholly sublime and Messianic one, 
  complete with visions of angels and archangels, and the Lord of Judgment seated 
  on His Heavenly Throne), the height of which it did not even comprehend itself, 
  and which remained a mystery right into the 20th century, throughout the Soviet 
  era and remains so in the midst of present world events. The key to understanding 
  the mystery lies in what Paul termed <i>the discerning of spirits</i>, a gift 
  which the World-church, despite its pretenses to every spiritual gift, lacks. 
  (I Corinthians 12:10). It exists in the ability to discern the difference between 
  the truly Christ-like, and perfected (nonviolent) character of the sons and 
  daughters of Adam, and the Universal Person of Christ itself. The latter (the 
  Angel of Divine Presence) dwells majestically in all things, and particularly 
  in the collective Presence of every primal (so-called &quot;pagan,&quot; ancient 
  angelic), soul. What does the Scriptures say about those angels who left their 
  former estate? (See 2 Peter 2:4-6). The very same holds true for those sons 
  and daughters of Adam who, being once enlightened, returned in time to mingle 
  with these warrior spirits, forgetting the Word that gave them life, and in 
  the process brought forth <i>giants</i> (or titans). </font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">RELIGIOUS BYZANTINISM</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About 1000 A.D. Russia was officially 
    converted to Christianity by the baptism of the Kievan Prince Vladimir and 
    his subjects. Of course, it was only the beginning of the Christian mission, 
    supported by the state, among Slavic and Finnish tribes of the eastern European 
    plain. Yet from the very outset Vladimir had to make a choice of tremendous 
    historical significance: between the Eastern and Western forms of Christianity, 
    between Byzantium and Rome. The Christian Church was still united at the time 
    of conversion. But the relations between its Greek and Latin halves were hopelessly 
    spoiled and were moving towards the final break of 1054. Vladimir chose the 
    Greek Church...and thus determined the destiny of Russia. She became a province 
    of Byzantine culture and the bearer of the Eastern Orthodoxy...The whole Russian 
    mind and heart were shaped by this Eastern Christian mould. After 1054 official 
    ecclesiastical relations with Western Catholic Europe became practically impossible: 
    after the Mongolian conquest of 1240, the political and cultural ties with 
    the West were almost severed. These two facts are the source of both the originality 
    and the limitations of Russian culture; of both its greatness and its flaws...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is certainly untrue to say that 
    medieval Greece, or the &quot;Roman Empire,&quot; as she called herself, was 
    a barbarian state </font>(which it largely was)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    On the contrary, until the twelfth century, Byzantine civilization surpassed, 
    beyond question, that of the European West. Until the year 1000--the time 
    of the Russian conversion--western Europe can be considered as a dark and 
    backward province of the one Christian civilization, the center of which was 
    definitely not in Rome, but in Constantinople...The latter was a treasure 
    store of classical literature which preserved for us the ancient pagan and 
    Christian traditions of Greece...Byzantium was a museum and a library of Christian 
    Greece. When the West began to spread its wings for original thought and art 
    it soon overtook Byzantium in creative richness and power...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The relative immobility of Byzantium 
    must not be conceived in too literal a sense. There were changes, but they 
    were slow; there were conflicts, but they were less acute than in the West. 
    Byzantium never had a sufficient cleavage with antiquity to allow it to start 
    a new culture. The term &quot;Middle Ages,&quot; therefore has no application, 
    in its full sense in the Christian East. The tradition of Hellenistic culture 
    was never broken...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This lack of creative vitality 
    prevented Byzantium from achieving the final synthesis between the pagan and 
    Christian elements of its heritage. It was, in principle, a totalitarian culture 
    claiming a Christian (orthodox) sanctification of the whole life, state, war, 
    economics, family, school, art, and learning. And yet big undefined elements 
    of paganism remained, without any serious attempt at transformation. The school 
    was the guardian of pagan traditions, blended only superficially with Christianity. 
    The monastery, on the contrary, never was in Byzantium the place of learning 
    it often was in the West. From time to time a strange figure arises out of 
    the twilight of the Byzantine schoolrooms: a semi-pagan philosopher, a neoplatonist 
    or occultist...Palace and hermitage were the two foci of the Byzantine world. 
    The tension between them was the only serious drama in this static culture...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the historical point of view, 
    one cannot help seeing in this religious dualism of Byzantium the heritage 
    of the two religious worlds: Judaism and Hellenism. If is is true that the 
    whole of Byzantine culture was a blending of Orientalism and Hellenism, the 
    Orientalism was represented in the religious sphere by Judaic transcendentalism, 
    and the Hellenism by the mystical and sacramental elements of Christianity. 
    What is amazing in this synthesis is the small place left to the New Testament 
    and to the historical God-man Christ. Practically the whole of Byzantine religion 
    could have been built without the historical Christ of the Gospels, upon a 
    simple myth of the heavenly saviour similar to Hellenistic saviour myths. 
    The divine, glorified Christ is, certainly, the main object of the Byzantine 
    cult--together with His Mother, the Queen of Heaven. Yet strangely, his earthly 
    life, and His good news of the Kingdom of God, and particularly His teaching, 
    attracted little attention. The Gospels became a book of mysteries of Christ; 
    a source of theological speculations. (Though) Christ Himself was the Word 
    of God, His own spoken word was little heeded--or rather, was almost inaccessible 
    beneath all the allegorical exegesis. Of the ethical teaching of Jesus what 
    remained most forceful was His uncompromising commandments, obviously beyond 
    human achievement, reinforced by the promise of Terrible Judgment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A corollary of this attitude toward 
    Christ was in the character of Byzantine preaching. The Greek sermon was mostly 
    theological. Its paramount aim was to disclose the meaning of a particular 
    feast in the Church calendar and its mystical significance. The sermon itself 
    was a continuation of the liturgy, sharing in its solemn, theurgical style, 
    but the moral implications were often neglected. This gives us the key to 
    a tremendous gap in the Byzantine religion: the weakness of ethical life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Greek fathers of the fourth 
    century, with all their Platonic and mystical interests, had been prophetic 
    teachers to their nation. They considered the struggle against evil in personal 
    and social life the main task of a Christian. But after some real efforts 
    at transforming and Christianizing the national life in the first century 
    after Constantine, the Church seems to have exhausted herself and given up 
    the fruitless struggle. The sanctification of the whole life became a symbolic 
    consecration, not a real change. The Orientalism of the state, rebuilt by 
    Diocletian, was paralleled by the orientalization of social life which had 
    fallen to the level of oriental, pagan societies. Slavery was not only one 
    of the basic social institutions but the model type of all social relationships. 
    Everyone was the slave of his superiors and master to his inferiors. The ethics 
    of slavery, in the disguise of Christian humility, were accepted and idealized 
    by the Byzantine Church. In reading the Byzantine historians one is appalled 
    by the amount of cruelty and perfidy occurring at every step: regicides; tortures 
    and mutilations of vanquished foes; blinding and castration not only of individuals 
    but of whole captive armies. Perhaps half of the Byzantine emperors came to 
    the throne through revolt, and often by shedding the blood of their predecessors, 
    despite the sacred character of the monarchy. Certainly there was cruelty 
    in the Western Middle Ages too, but in Byzantium one is confronted by a cold, 
    passionless cruelty which finds no moral opposition from either the narrating 
    authors or--with rare exceptions--from the contemporary Church. The mixture 
    of cruelty and perfidy is often considered as typically oriental...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is true that one draws this 
    impression from the descriptions of life in high society and the imperial 
    palace. The middle classes and the simple folk may have led a more decent 
    life. Unfortunately, we know very little about the life of the lower classes 
    in Byzantium. Byzantium had its religious focus not at the base but at the 
    top of the social pyramid. The &quot;basileus&quot; was the model of devotion, 
    and the palace the center of theological and ecclesiastical interests. The 
    Patriarch who headed the Church was always connected with the palace and often 
    shared its political activities and crimes. Spiritual independence and sometimes 
    real holiness could be achieved in seclusion from the world, in a monk's cell. 
    But this cell was more remote from the folk life than the cell of a Western 
    monk...The monks in Byzantium did not preach to the people and rarely taught 
    them. They did little to change the fundamentally pagan character of society, 
    which continued the life of the ancient Hellenistic empires in a considerably 
    deteriorated form. A certain amount of hypocrisy was naturally created by 
    the half-conscious feeling of incompatibility between the pagan structure 
    of society and Christian standards. This was the general impression of the 
    Russian Slavs when they came into contact with their Byzantine teachers: &quot;The 
    Greeks have been deceivers up to this day,&quot; was the verdict of an ancient 
    Russian annalist. </font>The Russian Religious Mind, pp.21-36<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This was the form of Christianity inherited by Russia, and 
  by and large the dynamics of Church and State remained the same. But not entirely 
  so. While the Mystery remained a mystery, even to the church, (continued)...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ancient Church was heir of 
    the cult of both the Synagogue and the Hellenistic mysteries. From the Synagogue 
    came, and remained forever, the Psalm type of prayer and Scripture reading; 
    from Hellenism, the framework of mysteries in words and symbolic actions. 
    The mysteries were destined for the few, for the initiates only. Yet since 
    the whole Empire belonged to the initiates, the mysteries were brought forth 
    to the masses. The danger of this vulgarization was met by a retroactive process. 
    The Church now tried to protect and to hide the mysteries again, particularly 
    the Eucharist, which is the core of the Church life and its cult. Hence the 
    tendency, and afterward the rule of pronouncing secretly the prayers of consecration 
    as well as many others; the development of the altar railing into the High 
    Iconostasis, completely hiding the sanctuary from the lay people...</font>(If 
    the Church had known the full and epic meaning of the Mystery--particularly 
    of the Eucharist, and of those who would offer it in the truest and fullest 
    way in the last days--we assume that it would have readily divulged it to 
    the people themselves. It would have wanted to participate in the gift of 
    prophecy, and would have been zealous to see, as the prophets did, right into 
    the events of the 20th century. But then Paul says: <i>How else shall God 
    judge the world?</i>)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Hence also, 
    under the use of late neoplatonic theurgical language, the new verbal vestments 
    of mysteries, which made them sublime and inaccessible, even dangerous for 
    the unworthy, in its full sense, &quot;mysteria tremenda.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
    the same time, between the sixth and eighth centuries, another mighty influence 
    helped shape the Eastern cult: the imperial palace. Many of the court ceremonies 
    and adoration formulas, the silk and gold vestments, were adopted by the Church. 
    Even now, after more than a thousand years and on foreign Slavic soil, the 
    Constantinopolitan palace still lives in every Orthodox Church, particularly 
    in the Cathedral. The beginning of the episcopal Mass, for instance, closely 
    follows the ceremony of the Emperor's dressing. </font>(p.52)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">...the books of the Church, the Psalms and the Gospels (Paul's 
  epistles remained an obscurity), but the Lives of the Saints, and a great wealth 
  of apocryphal books and other literature of the type, were translated into the 
  language of the Slavonic Church--which was at that time the language of the 
  peoples themselves. This provided those who belonged to the Church, or who were 
  moved by its presence, and various other intellectuals, and somewhat in general 
  the people themselves, with a more or less access to these works. But all of 
  it only added to the overall mysterium that pervaded and governed the Russian 
  state of mind (moreso than in America where the church and the palace are not 
  cut of the same cloth as it is, and where the Scriptures are poured over in 
  a more academic, but also in the most gregarious and free-wheeling ways). On 
  the one hand because of the very narrow channels of interpretation actually 
  open to the people (lacking the evolving Western point of view), and on the 
  other hand because of a vast network of shared myths and superstitions, nationalistic 
  in scope, and a great many of them apocalyptic in nature. The Russian religious 
  mind is actually obsessed with end-days scenarios, with visions of judgment, 
  with descriptions of the Antichrist, and with a pervading sense of certainty 
  that Russia itself is somehow central to it all, and that all of the deprivations 
  and sorrows that Russia has experienced in its history have been a prelude and 
  a preparation to the Messianic role to which it has been called. It is the pagan 
  (angelic) spirit in Russia, however, that has been called to it. The true child 
  of God (the true Christian, true Jew, true Muslim) has never been called by 
  God to participate in the deeds of mortal combat, in the killing of other human 
  beings. If they do it is in direct violation of the precepts of Christ. It was 
  the pagan spirit in Russia that was called to its feet in 1917 to overthrow 
  both the Czar and the Church, to end the mindless conspiracy of both against 
  the soul and the spiritual welfare of the people. And it is the pagan, and by 
  this we mean the primal angelic spirit that dwells in humankind, that must rise 
  up again, as it is written: <i>Cast in the Sickle for the harvest of the earth 
  is ripe. </i>(Joel 3:9-14).</font></p>

    dome of the Byzantine temple is large and round </font> (containing a multiple 
    layer of spheres)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, a living symbol 
    of heaven descending upon earth. Therefore, longing is not the most essential 
    emotion of the faithful, nor joy, but fear and exaltation. Man, sinful, and 
    unworthy man, is called to contemplate the Divine Glory. He stands in the 
    palace of the Heavenly King who is imagined seated upon a throne behind the 
    Iconostasis, seeing everything in man's heart and mind. The contrition, self-humiliation, 
    fear, and beseeching of man on the one side, and the radiant glory of God 
    on the other: between these two religious poles runs a whole gamut of liturgical 
    emotions. (p.56)...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    typical Byzantine icon of Christ is </font>(not that of the suffering, crucified 
    Saviour of the West, but)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> that of 
    the Pantocrator, the Lord Omnipotent. It is the image of the glorified Christ 
    regnant on His heavenly throne. We are not even sure that it is not an image 
    of the Eternal God rather than that of Christ. In fact, he bears a designation 
    around His head as the One </font>(the Angel of Divine Presence)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    who spoke to Moses. The Greek tradition did not know any image of God the 
    Father as distinct from the Son because in the theology of icons only the 
    Incarnation makes legitimate and humanly possible the representation of the 
    Godhead. But, as the Son is the image of the Father, so through the face of 
    the Son we see the Father as well. Thus, the Pantocrator is really the icon 
    of both the Father and the Son: the Godhead in all His glory and majesty...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was said that the iconographic type itself originated in the Zeus of Phidias. 
    This was, indeed, the evolution of Christ's image in the pictorial arts: after 
    the Good Shepherd (Hermes), came Christ as Asclepius, the mild healer of the 
    fourth and fifth centuries; then Christ as Zeus. Yet the expression of Phidias' 
    Olympian god had changed. Sorrow and severity are written upon this divine 
    face as if it were forced, unwillingly, to contemplate men's crimes and sins. 
    Christ-Pantocrator is, indeed, the Christ of the Last Judgment or of the &quot;Terrible 
    Judgment&quot; as it is called by the Greeks, not the Redeemer, but the Judge.

    OTHERS DEFEND LIFE IN AMERICA</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Alison Smale</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Russians are not, as the old 
    movie would have it, coming. They have gone. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some have slammed the door on America--the 
    country where, as one of them put it, his Russian friends have become &quot;slaves 
    to the dollar&quot;--and have gone back home to Moscow, to St. Petersburg, 
    to Kiev.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And by voicing just what they feel 
    about this place, they have left in their wake a small but impassioned debate 
    about how Russians really view America...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a story (in the Brooklyn weekly 
    newspaper, the Russian Bazaar), Velentin Labunsky...wrote at great lengths 
    about the complaints of three departing immigrants a 24-year-old female student, 
    a 30-year-old male journalist and a 50-year-old former headmaster.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Broadly speaking, the three, who 
    had been in America from one to four years, bemoaned the obsession with materialism, 
    the emptiness of conversation, (the constant need to be entertained), the 
    ugliness and what the student deemed &quot;the utter treelessness&quot; of 
    their part of Brooklyn, and the functionality and inelegance of what she branded 
    &quot;the American uniform, jeans and sneakers.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Above all they lamented the lack 
    of what Russians call &quot;dukhovnost,&quot; the spiritual dimension of life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The headmaster, his wife and son, 
    who became a computer programmer, depicted a four-year struggle to establish 
    themselves in New York City. When finally they had a halfway decent apartment, 
    good jobs, a car, had paid off their debts and even had some money to spare, 
    he said, &quot;we suddenly found a terrible emptiness inside.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There in St. Petersburg, 
    we lived poorly, but to the full,&quot;...Suddenly deprived of their full 
    spiritual life, &quot;We really realized that human beings do not live by 
    bread alone,&quot; the headmaster added.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When we were struggling here 
    to survive, we didn't think about this. But when we had finally staggered 
    to our feet, we started to look for America's dukhovnost. And we just couldn't 
    find it. I don't want to heap dirt on America, a country that accepted us 
    as its own. But neither I, nor my family, could accept the values of this 
    world, all their serials, their humor, their TV. And not because it's worse 
    than ours. It just isn't ours.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I calmed down a lot,&quot; 
    (said the 30-year-old journalist), being back here. Here I really feel as 
    if I am in my place, where I belong. One reason is that I realized I have 
    to be really in the center of Russian culture--and not on its edges.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maskim, who is back at his old 
    job at a Moscow newspaper, said the education of his 7-year-old son also played 
    a big part in the decision to move back.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The school we can get him 
    into here will give him a much better education than the public school in 
    Brooklyn...My son will always be able to go to America--it won't be closed 
    off to him,&quot; Maskim added. &quot;Russia is getting more Americanized, 
    and anyway America is a more universal culture than ours. It will be accessible. 
    If we stayed in America, he would be completely American, and not know our 
    culture, which is more Eastern, and harder to get to know. I write poems--I 
    want him to be able to read them.&quot; </font>The New York Times<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
