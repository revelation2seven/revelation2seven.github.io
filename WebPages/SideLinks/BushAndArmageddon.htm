<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Part V: Bush Has Hijacked 
  the Presidency and He Has Hijacked God</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A BUZZFLASH EDITORIAL 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the fifth installment in 
  an ongoing editorial series on how Bush has used God, as if the divine authority 
  were a servant, to justify his presidency, his actions and his war.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Virtually every denomination in the 
  United States, with the exception of the Southern Baptists and Evangelicals, 
  views the war as immoral and a violation of God's precepts. In recent months, 
  Bush wouldn't even meet with these men and women of God (with the exception 
  of an emissary from the Pope), despite repeated overtures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush claims that this is a war of 
  divine providence. He believes that God made him president to conduct a holy 
  crusade against evil infidels. But there is no evidence to justify his hijacking 
  of God. It is just more proof that this nation and the world must endure the 
  madness of King George.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this fifth editorial, we will 
  let the men and women who are liaisons with God speak for themselves. We want 
  to remind you that the leaders of the three denominations that the Bush family 
  belongs to (Episcopal/George the Elder, Methodist/George the Boy King, and Catholic/Jeb 
  the King in Waiting) all -- in the name of God -- vigorously oppose an Iraq 
  War.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are statements from eight Christian 
  denominations opposing the war:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNITED METHODIST: &quot;It is inconceivable 
  that Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior and the Prince of Peace, would support 
  this proposed attack.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-

  global response to Iraq's threats that conforms with traditional moral limits 
  on the use of military force.&quot; </font></p>

  of faith, indeed those of the three Abrahamic faiths &#150; Judaism, Christianity 
  and Islam &#150; is to point us all toward a God abounding in compassion and 
  love for each one of us. &#133; Those who argue for war have said that war can 
  be an act of service to the global community, and religious language is employed 
  to justify such an action. How can this be when war would have a profoundly 
  damaging effect upon countless innocent people? How can this be when war would 
  further fuel the anger and frustration so many people around the globe, far

  evidence that Iraq poses an imminent military threat, we will continue to press

  Armageddon Anxiety, Evil on the Way<br>
  by WILLIAM COOK</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bob Woodward's deferent, perhaps 
  even obeisant homage to &quot;Dubya&quot; in his recent book, Bush at War, contains 
  this troubling observation: &quot;The President was casting his mission and 
  that of the country in the grand vision of God's Master Plan.&quot; This frightening 
  perception followed the President's declamation, &quot;We will export death 
  and violence to the four corners of the earth in defense of this great country 
  and rid the world of evil.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Considering how Bush Jr. grew up 
  beneath the Reagan/Bush baldacchino and then helped guide his father's ascension 
  to the throne, his connections with the Christian Right has a long and deep 
  history, including familiarity with the pseudo-prophet, Hal Lindsey, a frequent 
  visitor to the Reagan White House.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lindsey, the New York Times &quot;Best 
  Selling Author&quot; of the past three decades, author of at least 20 books 
  like The Late Great Planet Earth, and influential Father of Christian Zionism, 
  foresees the imminent and unavoidable great battle of Armageddon, the fulfillment 
  of John's prophecy in the Book of Revelation, the cataclysmic conflict between 
  the forces of Good against the forces of Evil, climaxing in our lifetime. Jesus 
  Christ, King of the Jews, will return to rule the world from the rebuilt temple 
  in the reclaimed nation of Israel according to the prophecies, and we will witness 
  the inevitable suffering and global holocaust. Lindsey proclaims deliverance 
  from Armageddon depends on understanding God's purposes for the Jews including 
  the restoration of Israel as a nation in the land of Judea and Samaria.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lindsey also proclaims that he purposefully 
  writes these books to shock people into believing in Jesus Christ as their Lord 
  and Savior. And like any good insurance salesman, he instills fear as he threatens 
  his customers with the plagues revealed in the Acts of the Apostles and the 
  Book of Revelation: &quot;... The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the 
  moon into blood....With Justice he judges and makes war ... He is dressed in 
  a robe dipped in blood and his name is the word of God ... Out of his mouth 
  comes a sharp sword with which to strike down nations. .so you may eat the flesh 
  of kings, generals, and mighty men, of horses and their riders, and the flesh 
  of all people, free and slave, small and great&quot; The Messiah slays the Antichrist 
  and &quot;creates a new heaven and a new earth&quot; and He judges the dead, 
  saves the Christians, and casts the rest into eternal perdition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lindsey accepts as reality that his 
  interpretations of the prophecies come directly to him from God, &quot;I believe 
  that the Spirit of God gave me a special insight, not only into how John described 
  what he actually experienced, but also into how this whole phenomenon encoded 
  the prophecies so that they could be fully understood only when their fulfillment 
  drew near ... I prayerfully sought for a confirmation for my apocalypse code 
  theory...&quot; This self-proclaimed, God inspired interpreter of the Bible 
  has had a profound influence on American and British Christians and Jews. Since 
  Ronald Reagan's Christian based regime of the '80s which included access to 
  the President by not only Lindsey, but Jerry Falwell and the Christian Zionist 
  televangelist Mike Evans, the interests of Zionism as an integral component 
  of prophetic lure have been central in policy formation toward Israel in particular 
  and the mid-east generally in both America and the United Kingdom. The current 
  administration, even more so than Reagan's, is rife with right-wing reliance 
  on the coming revival predicted in the Book of Revelation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider observations made by Paul 
  Krugman of the New York Times December 18, 2002: &quot;Tom DeLay soon to be 
  House majority leader, told a church group that: 'Only Christianity offers a 
  way to live in response to the realities that we find in this world &shy; only 
  Christianity.' He also said he was on a mission from God to promote a 'biblical 
  worldview' in American politics.&quot; This from the most powerful man in the 
  Congress! And he is not alone. According to Krugman, many leading Congressional 
  Republicans belong to the &quot;secretive&quot; Council for National Policy, 
  an organization founded by Tim LaHaye, co-author of the apocalyptic &quot;Left 
  Behind&quot; novels. Members include Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Sen. Jesse Helms, 
  Congressman Dick Armey and Tom DeLay of Texas, Howard Phillips, and many, many 
  others. This fundamentalist group listens, in private, to none other than the 
  self-proclaimed &quot;Born Again&quot; Christian, George W. Bush. Consider also 
  the appointment of John Ashcroft to the position of Attorney General, a vocal 
  Christian fundamentalist who &quot;gives every appearance of placing his biblical 
  worldview above secular concerns...&quot; Add to this the neo-cons in the administration 
  like Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Pearle, Feith, and many others, and one understands 
  that the ties that bind the neocon Christian right, read Christian Zionists, 
  to the Zionist orthodox Jew cement mentalities that embrace myths as truth and 
  behavior directed by superstitious beliefs, regardless of those who do not share 
  their zeal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe that the views expressed 
  by Hal Lindsey as they are reflective of beliefs held by &quot;Dominionists,&quot; 
  including Dr. Tony Evans, founder of Promise Keepers, Dr. Martin Hawkins, Assistant 
  to Evans, James Ryle of the Vineyard Movement among others, permeate the Bush 
  administration's major figures, most especially the President, guide their approach 
  to foreign policy, and transform their perception of themselves as executers 
  of God's will. The potential destructive power inherent in this mentality, that 
  accepts as truth interpretations of mythological stories or willingly uses those 
  interpretations to exhort others to action, can be understood and can be thwarted 
  before such devastation occurs. That conclusion we can draw from history should 
  we consider the destructive power of myth as it was wielded by Urban II as he 
  inaugurated the Crusades to liberate Jerusalem, Innocent III when he exterminated 
  the Cathar sect in the 12th and 13th centuries, the Puritan divines when they 
  slaughtered the Pequot Indians in 1636-37, and the elimination of the beliefs 
  extant in northern Europe before the onslaught of Christianity in the middle 
  ages, to offer a few examples. When the elite few who gain power in a country 
  or over a group of people accept myths as truth, or when they insidiously and 
  ruthlessly use the beliefs people hold to affect their ends, devastation follows. 
  An enlightened American public can thwart the myth driven elite. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michael Ortiz Hill, author of Dreaming 
  the End of the World, characterizes Bush, in his essay in CounterPunch January 
  4, 2003, as &quot;...delusional and the shape of his delusion is specifically 
  apocalyptical in belief and intent.&quot; By apocalyptical Hill means that &quot;All 
  systems are supposed to go down so the Messiah can come and Bush, seemingly, 
  has taken on the role of the one who brings this to pass.&quot; &quot;God sovereignly 
  controls all aspects of life&quot; according to this view, and that understanding 
  is inherent in the teachings of the Promise Keepers Movement and its founder, 
  Dr. Tony Evans, and the perspective of Billy Graham, two of the prominent right-wing 
  Christians who have influenced Bush. Graham is credited with Bush's rebirth 
  in Christ and Dr. Tony Evans is pastor of a large Dallas church where Bush heard 
  a great deal about &quot;how the world should be seen from a divine viewpoint&quot; 
  according to Dr. Martin Hawkins, assistant to Evans. (Hill).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both the Promise Keepers and the 
  Vineyard Movements according to Gary Gilley in &quot;The Vineyard Movement&quot; 
  accept the doctrine of &quot;end time&quot; or &quot;dominionism&quot; that 
  believes there will be a seizure of earthly power by God's people (read Christians) 
  to restore the earth to God's control. Dominion theology teaches that Christ 
  restored dominion over life to the followers of Christ, but the church now has 
  the obligation of redeeming society in order to bring about the Second Coming. 
  They also contend that the kingdom of God is now and they have the responsibility 
  to manifest God's power before the entire world. Taking control of the earth 
  must happen before Christ will return to usher in the physical kingdom on earth 
  over which He will reign.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Christian Zionists also believe 
  that, before Christ can return, the Jews must return to Israel. Many evangelical 
  Christians cite Genesis 12 and 13 to demonstrate that &quot;the Jews have title 
  deed to Israel and that the land must not be given back to the Palestinians,&quot; 
  according to Thomas Williamson in his article &quot;To Whom Does the Land of 
  Palestine Belong?&quot; Christian Zionists, according to Williamson, &quot;regard 
  God's covenant with Abraham, including the land grant, as an unconditional covenant.&quot; 
  More frighteningly, &quot;Every act taken by Israel is orchestrated by God, 
  and should be condoned, supported, and even praised by the rest of us,&quot; 
  notes Grace Halsell in her article &quot;Israeli Extremists and Christian Fundamentalists: 
  The Alliance.&quot; Not all Christians accept this interpretation, but for those 
  who do, the reestablishment of Israel in 1948 ushered in the conditions necessary 
  to bring about the rapture: Jewish control of Jerusalem and rebuilding the temple. 
  Then and only then can the final, great battle called Armageddon begin. Estimates 
  vary, but Halsell claims &quot;10 to 40 million Americans believe Palestine 
  is God's chosen land for the Jews&quot;(1). Maintenance of Israel as a nation 
  becomes an obligation on the part of Christian Zionists if Biblical prophecy 
  is to be fulfilled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That places George W. Bush in a unique 
  position as a leader of the world's mightiest military power: to bring about 
  the fulfillment of God's prophecy. Hill claims that Bush has accepted this eschatology 
  through which he sees himself &quot;as an agent of God who has been called by 
  him to 'restore the earth to God's control'&quot; (2). S.R. Shearer of Antipas 
  Ministries, notes Hill, calls this delusional. Hill refers to Bob Woodward's 
  new book, Bush at War, to give substance to this Messianic view of the President. 
  Woodward observes &quot;The president was casting his mission and that of the 
  country in the grand vision of God's Master Plan&quot; (2). Add to these comments 
  the closing sentence of his 2003 State of the Union Speech, &quot;The liberty 
  we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity,&quot; 
  and we can sense his Messianic fervor as he leads the world against the &quot;man-made&quot; 
  forces of evil. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, the determination 
  of that evil resides in the beliefs of those interpreting the &quot;prophecies&quot; 
  and those who accept those interpretations as truth. For Lindsey and the Vineyard 
  ministers, God's covenant with the Jews is truth and it translates, according 
  to Stephen R. Sizer, into the need for America to &quot;continue military and 
  economic funding of Israel,&quot; for Israel to &quot;resist negotiating land 
  for peace,&quot; &quot;maintain their apartheid policies,&quot; and incite fundamentalist 
  groups to destroy the Dome of the Rock so the new temple can be built. Lindsey 
  accuses those who refuse to accept this eschatology as anti-Semitic. This transition 
  from biblical prophecy to current events translates myth into international 
  policy emphasizing the potential destructive power of mythology. Who are these 
  self-appointed servants of the Almighty who give direction to Israeli and US 
  leaders regarding the establishment of nation states, the conception and determination 
  of evil, and the righteousness of actions taken on behalf of their interpretation 
  of God's word? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lindsey believes, as we have noted, 
  that the Spirit of God has given him special insight &quot;into how this whole 
  phenomenon encoded the prophecies&quot; Others like James Ryle of Promise Keepers 
  find God giving revelation through dreams and visions; in Hippo in the Garden, 
  he notes that he was called to preach through a prophetic word situation (91). 
  In either case, their interpretations come from an indeterminable source, yet 
  a source of vast power and consequence. Lindsey writes &quot;Only now, as mankind 
  approaches the third millennium, do I feel like the Holy Spirit has provided 
  me with the proper perspective &shy; the Big Picture, so to speak &shy; on the 
  mind blowing experiences of the modern world&quot; (Planet Earth 2000 A.D.). 
  And what are those &quot;mind blowing experiences&quot;? &quot;I am certain 
  The Second Advent will occur in the next few years &shy; probably in your lifetime.&quot; 
  And, &quot;the greatest threat to freedom and world peace today &shy; is Islamic 
  fundamentalism&quot; (The Final Battle). Acceptance of these modern day prophets 
  and their beliefs by the elite in power portends disaster for American policy 
  in the mid-east in particular and for American interests generally. But, as 
  we have seen, these ministers of God have the ear of those in power in the current 
  administration. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two issues arise immediately: why 
  should America determine its future course based on interpretations of God's 
  word as contained in documents 2500 years old, designed and written for civilizations 
  long dead? And, second, what is the evil that these modern day prophets determine 
  as the threat against God's predictions? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plainly, the Books of Genesis, Daniel, 
  and Revelation, the primary sources for &quot;end-time theology,&quot; for &quot;Dominionism,&quot; 
  for the Apocalyptic perspective, and for Armageddon, while accepted by literalists 
  as the word of God, are in fact derivatives of stories and ideas from other 
  cultures that anti-date Moses by hundreds of years and John, the purported author 
  of Revelation, by more than 1700 years. How then can they be the word of God? 
  How can Americans take seriously the interpretations of Pseudo-prophets who 
  claim to know the meaning of prophecies when they are only the latest in a series 
  of such claimants that date back to Joachim of Fiore, an Italian monk of the 
  12th century, Christopher Columbus in the early 1500s, Martin Luther, Thomas 
  Muentzer in the 16th century, the Puritans in America, the interpretations arising 
  out of Nazism and Marxism, William Miller and John Darby to mention a few who 
  appeared before the most recent group headed by Lindsey (PBS).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There can be no doubt that the Book 
  of Revelation has had a searing impact on the American conscience that dates 
  back to the establishment of God's &quot;city on a hill&quot; given to the Puritan's 
  by God Himself. The absolute acceptance of the forces of good and evil as extant 
  and operative in the world, concepts that date back to influences from ancient 
  Greece and Persia in the 5th to 3rd centuries before Christ, existed without 
  question in the Puritan mind. Hope in the eventual victory of the forces of 
  good over evil, however, existed long before the 5th century BCE in the &quot;Enuma 
  and Elish&quot; stories of the struggles between chaos and order that date to 
  1780 BCE in Mesopotamia. These myths tell of Marduk, the God of light, struggling 
  against Tiamat, the force of evil, to bring order out of chaos and peace to 
  the world (www.gatewaystobabylon.com). The influence of these myths on the Book 
  of Genesis, purportedly written by Moses who was born in 1571, is unmistakable 
  and conveyed directly in Psalm 74:14,15,16. But Marduk is not Yahweh, yet current 
  pseudo-prophets will declare the accuracy of their visions as direct from God 
  who speaks to humankind from the pages of the Old and New Testaments. They fail 
  to account for the origins of God's word that comes from non-Jewish sources. 
  Many ancient myths influenced the Bible: the burning of the world by the Hindu 
  God, Shiva; the Akkadian prophecies from Mesopotamia; the messiah-like king 
  that takes over the world, rewards the just, and rules forever from the Uruk 
  Prophecy; and the judgment of the dead by the Egyptian god Maat for the good 
  and evil they performed in their lifetime. (Patricia Eddy, &quot;The Persian 
  Connection: the End of the World Begins&quot;)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judaism also borrowed &quot;angels, 
  the holy spirit, paradise in heaven, eternal life, Judgment Day, the resurrection 
  of the dead, a fiery hell, a messianic savior, and man's personal responsibility 
  to do God's will&quot; from Persia (http://www.alsopreview.com)/. These same 
  concepts exist in Zoroaster's faith that prevailed in the 6th century BCE. He 
  designed a monotheistic God, Ahura Mazda, considered by some as a precursor 
  of the God of the Judaic Bible. Zoroaster's last battle between the forces of 
  good and evil, the biblical Armageddon, is headed by a messiah known as Saoshyant; 
  upon victory, he would herald in a millennium of peace and plenty. An apocalypse 
  preceded that last battle to gain the attention of the people. Indeed, the Book 
  of Revelation enlarges upon Zoroaster's end of the world concepts as do sections 
  in the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947 at Nag Hammadi and date to the 1st 
  and 2nd centuries CE. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, Christians reading 
  this literature have focused on the necessary and inevitable return of the Jews 
  to Judea-Samaria as conveyed in one source written by a monk in 950 CE, Adso 
  of Montier-En-Der at the request of Queen Gerbera of France as he interpreted 
  biblical passages. He also noted that there would arise &quot;the Last World 
  Emperor&quot; who would unite Christianity and defeat Muslims before the Antichrist 
  arises (PBS). This Christian Zionist focus that requires the fulfillment of 
  the covenant between God and His chosen people arises from two broad predictions 
  in the Old Testament: predictions of a return to Palestine from the Babylonian 
  exile and promises of Palestine as the land given by God to the Jews. <br>
  Scholars argue about these predictions, some claiming that God fulfilled His 
  promises when the Jews returned to Palestine, rebuilt the Temple and the Walls 
  of Jerusalem, and restored the religious life of the community under the Maccabees; 
  others disagree (http://www.users.cloud9.net/). Citations of God's promises 
  to &quot;the descendants of Abraham&quot; for land appear in Genesis 12:7, 13:15, 
  15:18, 28:13-14 among others. The dispute caused by these passages has to do 
  with the &quot;seed&quot; to which God promised the land. Zionists argue that 
  God's promise was to Jews only; others argue that the seed of Abraham includes 
  Arabs (www.mideastfacts.com). Regardless of these indeterminable disputes, &quot;prominent 
  evangelists preach to their followers that God never fulfilled &quot;His promise 
  of giving all the land of Palestine to the Jews&quot; (http://www.mideastfacts.com/) 
  and, consequently, support &quot;whatever action necessary, even nuclear war, 
  to obtain Arab lands in the Middle East and give them to Jews.&quot; [emphasis 
  mine] (mideastfacts) Obviously, such interpretations bring the world to the 
  brink of nuclear holocaust and represent to many in the Christian community 
  a backward step in theology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is it possible to believe in the 
  21st century that a God, designed by a small tribe of nomadic Semites 3500 years 
  ago from stories and myths that existed centuries before in the literatures 
  of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan, and elsewhere, could dictate to Americans 
  how they should conduct foreign policy? Myths after all are stories that explain 
  for a people how they perceive their existence in a world filled with mystery 
  and awe. They create reference points for the people to see connections between 
  their condition and forces greater than themselves or to understand how they 
  must relate to the society that surrounds them or to grapple with the internal 
  energies that reside within themselves. Yet we have in the union of Christian 
  Zionists and Jewish Zionists mentalities that find absolute truth in these myths 
  and willingly inflict them on the American populace. These beliefs bring ancient 
  prophecies from myths into today's political arena as this comment from Lindsey's 
  Planet makes all too clear: &quot;The dispute to trigger the war of Armageddon 
  will arise between the Arabs and Israelis over the Temple Mount and Old Jerusalem 
  (Zachariah 12:2-3), the most contested and strategic piece of real estate in 
  the world Two religions, Judaism and Islam, thus are on a collision course with 
  global and heavenly repercussions. Islam will never accept Jerusalem as the 
  undivided capital of the Jewish state, and Israel will never agree to give it 
  up&quot;(155).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider the comments of Margot Patterson 
  in the National Catholic Reporter last October 11, 2002: &quot;Thousands of 
  Christian Zionists met in Jerusalem for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot to cheer 
  Sharon and to declare their unconditional support for the state of Israel.&quot; 
  These people embrace &quot;end-time&quot; theology and are supported in turn 
  by right-wing Israelis who like the economic and political support they bring 
  to the Israeli cause. Christian fundamentalists and Jewish Messianic settlers, 
  according to Patterson, promise formation of a &quot;Greater Israel&quot; that 
  will usher in Armageddon. They, too, see war between Muslims and Jews as bringing 
  about the Second Coming. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patterson quotes a variety of sources 
  to enforce her perception of the political impact these interpreters of God's 
  word have on America's policies toward Israel and Palestine. James Zogby, President 
  of the Arab American Institute, argues &quot;despite disclaimers to the contrary 
  the US is waging a war on Islam at home and abroad even as it tacitly supports 
  extremist settlers in the occupied territories Israel controls.&quot; Lewis 
  Roth, President of Americans for Peace Now, says &quot;You have a number of 
  very conservative Christian groups that support settlements because they see 
  this as a way of strengthening Jewish hold on the land of Israel because in 
  their mind this is important for end-of-time theology and part of hastening 
  the Second Coming and the conversion of the Jews&quot; Since Jews have their 
  own Messianic reading of the biblical sources, different from the Christian 
  Zionists except in the necessity of fulfilling God's covenant to return the 
  Jews to Judea-Samaria, they find support of the Christian Zionists helpful in 
  bringing about the creation of Greater Israel that would include not only the 
  borders of the present state but the entire land of Israel described in the 
  Hebrew Scriptures. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider as well Robert Kaiser's 
  February 9, 2003 article &quot;Bush and Sharon Nearly Identical on Mideast Policy&quot; 
  in the Washington Post. Kaiser quotes Richard Pearle, chairman of the Pentagon's 
  Defense Policy Board, &quot;Israel should insist on Arab recognition of its 
  claim to the biblical land of Israel and should focus on removing Saddam Hussein 
  from power in Iraq;&quot; this despite multiple UNSC resolutions that declare 
  Israel in defiance of international law by holding on to these lands. But there's 
  more! Douglas Feith, undersecretary of defense for policy, has written extensively 
  on Israeli-Arab issues, and argues, according to Kaiser, &quot;that Israel has 
  as legitimate a claim to the West Bank territories seized after the Six-Day 
  War as it has to the land that was part of the U.N. mandated Israel created 
  in 1948.&quot; Indeed, Donald Rumsfeld has made the same claim even as he demands 
  that the UN force nations that defy UN resolutions to comply: &quot;There was 
  a war and they (neighboring countries) lost a lot of real estate to Israel because 
  Israel prevailed in that conflict.&quot; Here are America's Defense Department 
  spokesmen directly contradicting the UN resolutions demanding that Israel comply 
  with international law and the Geneva Conventions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why do these individuals speak for 
  America in this manner? Kaiser quotes a senior official of the first Bush administration 
  as saying &quot;Sharon played the president like a violin: 'I'm fighting your 
  war, terrorism is terrorism,' and so on, Sharon did a masterful job.&quot; Rabbi 
  Yechiel Eckstein, also quoted by Kaiser, claims &quot;President Bush's policy 
  stems from his core as a Christian, his perceptions of right and wrong, good 
  and evil, and of the need to stand up and fight against evilI personally believe 
  it is very personal, not a political maneuver on his part.&quot; Rev. Richard 
  Land of the Southern Baptist Convention echoed those sentiments when he noted 
  how important evangelical support for the president is and claimed, &quot;We 
  need to bless Israel more than America needs Israel's blessing because Israel 
  has a far greater ally than the United States of America, God Almighty.&quot; 
  That observation, you will recall, ended the President's State of the Union 
  address as quoted above. In short, America has at its helm a man who understands 
  his role in God's plan and is determined to carry forward regardless of the 
  views of world leaders or the American people. As Dr. Lower points out in Counterpunch, 
  &quot;Bush's war version of God 'has two dangerous implications' One is that 
  those who have lost their lives in service to God and country (Astronauts) 'weren't 
  actually taking risks or showing bravery because their fate was in God's hands. 
  The other implication is that tragedies are God's will.' This is in the tradition 
  of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell who suggested that the September 11th tragedy 
  happened because God had removed his active protection from an immoral United 
  States.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush is furthered in his drive to 
  Armageddon by those who surround him, both secular zealots intent on ensuring 
  Israel's expansion to the biblical lands given it by the covenant or by the 
  religious right that supports Sharon and controls great Jewish influence in 
  America. Perhaps the most recent evidence of this control on America's mid-east 
  policy comes in the person of Elliott Abrams, the recently appointed director 
  of Mideast Affairs for the National Security Council. Abrams has stated categorically: 
  &quot;The Palestinian leadership does not want peace with Israel, and there 
  will be no peace.&quot; Given his current position, we know the future of American 
  policy in Palestine. Abrams' prophecy of no peace allows the Christian Zionists 
  and the Jewish Zionists to usher in the forces of their perceived good against 
  the forces of their perceived evil, the Muslims. All of which makes possible 
  the scenario prophesied by Hal Lindsey in The Final Battle, making fiction truth 
  and truth fiction.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE TYRANT WILL SOON 
  BE GONE</font></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With war appearing inevitable and 
  imminent, President Bush on Monday night gave Saddam Hussein 48 hours to flee 
  Iraq or face a U.S.-led invasion. &quot;Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave 
  Iraq within 48 hours,&quot; Mr. Bush said in a nationally televised address. 
  &quot;Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict to commence AT 
  A TIME OF OUR CHOOSING.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The president spoke on the same day 
  the U.S. abandoned efforts at winning United Nations backing for a resolution 
  authorizing military action. He expressed disappointment that the U.N. had failed 
  to stand beside the United States. &quot;The United Nations Security Council 
  has not lived up to its responsibilities so we will rise to ours,&quot; the 
  president said. He said there can be no &quot;appeasement&quot; of Saddam because 
  it could bring &quot;destruction of a kind never before seen on this earth.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the first time since he drew 
  the nation's attention to Iraq last fall, Bush focused on the questions most 
  asked by Americans: WHY WAR? AND WHY NOW?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spelling out the threat, he said 
  Saddam has a history of hating America, has ties to terrorists and is a destabilizing 
  force in the Middle East. Primarily, he said Saddam could turn his weapons of 
  mass destruction over to terrorist groups. &quot;Before the day of horror can 
  come, before it is too late to act, this danger will be removed,&quot; Bush 
  said. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The United States did nothing 
  to deserve or invite this threat, but we will do everything to defeat it. Instead 
  of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course toward safety,&quot; 
  the president said from the White House. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Bush spoke after deciding to 
  raise the nation's terrorism alert from yellow to orange, the second-highest 
  category of risk. U.S. officials said the president feared the war might lead 
  to retaliatory strikes against U.S. interests at home and abroad. &quot;THE 
  TYRANT WILL SOON BE GONE,&quot; HE SAID.. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 48-hour clock started at 8 p.m. 
  EST Monday, White House spokesman Adam Levine said. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The president also addressed the 
  Iraqi people, telling them: &quot;The day of your liberation is near.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And he had a warning for Iraqi soldiers: 
  &quot;If war comes, do not fight for a dying regime that is not worth your own 
  life.&quot; To civilians in Iraq, he said, &quot;If we must begin a military 
  campaign it will be directed to lawless men who direct your country and not 
  at you.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He pledged the United States would 
  provide food, medicine and other assistance as Iraq recovers from war. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to CBS News Analyst and 
  retired NATO Commander Gen. Joseph Ralston, Mr. Bush's address was a &quot;loud 
  and clear signal to the men and women in uniform&quot; that they would soon 
  be on the battlefield. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier Monday, the effort to achieve 
  a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis came to an end when Britain's ambassador 
  withdrew a proposed U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing war. The U.S. 
  and Britain blamed France for the failure of the resolution, but the French 
  said the resolution was withdrawn because the U.S. lacked the votes needed for 
  passage. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saddam, showing no sign of heeding 
  U.S. demands that he step down, warned that American forces will find an Iraqi 
  fighter ready to die for his country &quot;behind every rock, tree and wall.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He also said Iraq once had weapons 
  of mass destruction, but denied still possessing them. &quot;When Saddam Hussein 
  says he has no weapons of mass destruction, he means what he says,&quot; the 
  Iraqi leader was quoted as saying in a meeting with a Tunisian diplomat. </font></p>
