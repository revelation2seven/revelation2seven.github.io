  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PARADISE LOST...Thousands 
    of years after it supposedly sank into the cold and gloomy depths of the Atlantic 
    Ocean, the island continent of Atlantis lives on as one of history's most 
    tantalizing puzzles. If indeed such a place existed, Atlantis was a civilization 
    unequaled before or since </font>(well not since)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Yet its chroniclers say that it vanished in little more than a single day, 
    leaving not a trace behind. </font>(continued)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">The point we will make here is that the legend 
    of Atlantis, and the stories about it that were passed on to Plato in the 
    4th century BC, is not merely an account of an Atlantean civilization that 
    existed (and which came to ruin), but that it is as much an account of the 
    future (our time to be exact), as it was of the past. The legend also includes 
    an account of things that were hidden in the center of the earth during the 
    time of the Ten ancient Atlantean kings (count Adam to Noah). These things--all 
    part of the ancient oral traditions--were revived and then hidden again in 
    the written tradition of Moses (the Book of Genesis), long before the time 
    of the priests of Sais in Egypt who passed on the stories to the Greeks. The 
    story of Atlantis is mostly a prophetic (futuristic) account, grown out of 
    the most ancient Atlantean-Hebrew-Vedic tradition, of things that were fated 
    to happen again at the end of the age, as history returned in time to the 
    Eden in the West, back to the root of the World Tree, and when the things 
    that were hidden in those ancient times resurfaced and revealed themselves 
    to the mind of the whole world (2 Peter 3:3-13).</font></p>

    <p><b>&quot;O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are all children, and there is no such 
      thing as an old Greek. 'What do you mean by that?' inquired Solon. 'You 
      are all young in mind,' came the reply: 'you have no belief rooted in the 
      old tradition, and no knowledge hoary with age...</b></p>
    <p><b>Our records tell how your city checked a great power </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
      children of &quot;Cain&quot;)</font><b> which arrogantly advanced from its 
      base in the Atlantic ocean to attack the cities of Europe and Asia. For 
      in those days the Atlantic was navigable. There was an island (a continent), 
      opposite the strait which you call (so you say) the Pillars of Hercules, 
      an island larger than Libya and Asia combined; from it travelers in those 
      days could reach the other islands, and from them the whole opposite continent 
      which surrounds what can truly be called the ocean. For the sea within the 
      strait we are talking about is like a lake with a narrow entrance; the outer 
      ocean is the real ocean and the land which entirely surrounds it is properly 
      termed continent. On this island of Atlantis had risen a powerful and remarkable 
      dynasty of kings, who ruled the whole island, and many other islands as 
      well and parts of the continent; in addition it controlled within the strait, 
      Libya (Africa) up to the borders of Egypt and Europe as far as Tyrrhenia.</b></p>
    <p><b> This dynasty, gathering its whole power together, attempted to enslave 
      at a single stroke, your country and ours and all the territory within the 
      strait&#133; At a later time there was earthquakes and &quot;floods&quot; 
      of extraordinary violence, and in a single dreadful day and night all your 
      fighting men were swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis 
      was similarly swallowed up by the sea and vanished; this is why the sea 
      in that area is to this day impassable to navigation, which is hindered 
      by mud just below the surface, the remains of a sunken island.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(See

  <p><font size="+1">The further point that we have been making throughout this 
    work is that the floods of Noah's time (recorded in the Book of Genesis) are 
    not an account of any geological or meteorological events that swept over 
    the earth, but rather they are prophetic accounts of the wars that swept over 
    and inundated that civilization until it was destroyed. Nor did the Atlanteans 
    literally sink beneath the sea, but the accounts of those times were submerged 
    beneath the collective historical consciousness of Western man, and almost 
    forgotten...but not completely:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Despite Plato's best efforts to 
  make Atlantis seem real, his descriptive account was soon the subject of controversy. 
  Even his student Aristotle claimed that Plato had fabricated the Atlantis story 
  and contrived the continent's catastrophic demise as a literary convenience.

  archetypal antichrists of those times, Alexander the Great)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
  For many centuries thereafter, scholarship in the Western world was based on 
  the reading of texts by the greats of earlier times, and philosophers generally 
  aligned themselves in schools of thought that were either Aristotelian or Platonic. 
  The Platonists claimed that Plato's account of Atlantis was straight history, 
  while Aristotelians took the opposite point of view and maintained that the 
  lost continent was pure myth. </font>(The Aristotelians were wrong)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even so, it was easy enough to believe 
  that a mysterious land might once have existed in the vastness of the Atlantic...When 
  the New World burst upon the European consciousness, the Americas quickly became 
  the prime candidates for the location of Atlantis...The English poet William 
  Blake believed that the Atlantean king Albion led the last of his subjects to 
  Britain, where they became Druids. Ancient Egyptians, Goths, and Scythes were 
  all seen to be escapees from doomed Atlantis...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More than a few archeologists, 
  astronomers, religious scholars, and amateur pyramid enthusiasts have argued 
  such questions through the centuries. While archeologists focus on the structure 
  purely as a historic artifact, other investigators have usually fallen into 
  three schools of thought. The first, and most common, holds that the pyramid 
  represents a universal system of measurement, that its very dimensions embody 
  archetypal measures of length and even time. A splinter group of nineteenth-century 
  pyramid students founded the second school, focusing on the structure's extraordinary 
  properties as a gigantic sundial and an astronomical observatory. These so-called 
  archeostronomers made a strong case that the pyramid builders, whoever they 
  were, had an awareness of astronomy and the earth's dimensions far superior 
  to anything previously imagined....Still others have accounted for the mathematical 
  wisdom the structure supposedly embodies by imagining that its builders came 
  from lost Atlantis...The pyramid itself maintains a stubborn silence. It has 
  never been completely explored nor completely explained...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Egyptologists have drawn 
  on their knowledge of Egyptian religion to explain the significance of the pyramid 
  shape, contending that it could have been connected with Sun worship. The angled 
  walls, they say, resembled the outspread rays of the sun descending earthward 
  FROM A CLOUD, and the pyramid thus represents A STAIRWAY TO THE HEAVENS. Some 
  students of the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead...even maintain that the pyramid 
  provided more than merely figurative passage to celestial realms. </font>(continued)...</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Joseph A. Seiss, in his The Great Pyramid, A Miracle 
  in Stone, says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;Canvassing the whole problem in light of history, religion, and 
    science, he (John Taylor) came to some very surprising conclusions involving 
    an altogether new departure in Pyramid investigations, and enunciating a number 
    of facts with regard to the mathematical features of the Great Pyramid, which 
    once were ridiculed, but are now generally admitted as true. In 1859 he published 
    a volume, in which he proposed to recover 'a lost leaf in the world's history,' 
    and gave his processes and the results. Without having seen the Great Pyramid, 
    but on the basis of facts recorded by others, he gave it as his theory and 
    conviction that the real architects of this edifice were not Egyptians, but 
    those of quite another faith and branch of the human family, who, by an impulse 
    and commission from heaven, and by the special aid of the Most High, induced 
    and superintended the erection of the mighty structure, as a memorial for 
    times long after, to serve as a witness of inspiration, and of the truth, 
    and purposes of God, over against the falsities and corruptions of a degenerate 
    and ever degenerating world. In other words he claimed to find, in the shape, 
    arrangements, measures, and various indications of the Great Pyramid, an intellectuality 
    and numerical knowledge of grand cosmological phenomena of earth and heaven, 
    which neither Egypt nor any of the nations possessed, or could even understand, 
    from a thousand years ago, back to the origins of the nations. (p.33)...</b></p>
  <p><b>From this also (the Pyramid) would seem to have its name. Though different 
    authors have sought to derive this word from the Greek, Arabic, and other 
    sources, the evidence is rather that it came directly from the builders of 
    the edifice, and was meant to describe it in the common language then used 
    in the country. The nearest to that language is Coptic. And in Coptic 'pyr' 
    means 'division,' the same as 'peres' in Daniel's interpretation of the handwriting 
    on the wall; and 'met' means 'Ten.' Chevalier Bunsen without thought of combining 
    them for the derivation of the word Pyramid, gives these words separately...And 
    putting them together--Pyr-Met--we have the name given to this structure. 
    And that name in the language of the ancient Egyptians means The Division 
    of Ten. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The Division of the

    at High Noon the Sun shines on all Five of its corners. (pp. 47-49).</b></p>
  <p><b>There is still a more distinct reference to the Great Pyramid in the Book

    up thy loins like a man, for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where 
    wast thou when I layed the Foundations of the earth? Declare if thou knowest?

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;If this Pyramid is what it would seem to be, it would be natural 
    to infer that it ought to have some connections with or reference to Jerusalem. 
    All the institutions and revelations of God had their chief center there for 
    more than a thousand years. God made it His own sacred metropolis, the only 
    one He ever had localized on earth. There His only Temple stood. There His 
    holy laws were deposited. Thither His people were required to come for the 
    celebration of their most distinguished services. There was the royal seat 
    of His chosen kings. There was the sacred capitol of His consecrated priests, 
    of His inspired prophets, of His holy scribes. There the glorious Messiah 
    presented himself to the elect nation. There he died for the sins of the world...And 
    if the Great Pyramid belongs at all to the great system of God's redemptive 
    interpositions, it could hardly be wanting in some reference to that 'City 
    of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.' (pp.166,67)...</b></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>From the earliest known times different portions of the heavens have been 
    designated, and known by certain figures supposed to be outlined by the stars 
    which they embrace. There are about eighty of these constellations. The stars 
    of which they are composed the Bible declares to be for 'signs'`as well as 
    for seasons, days, and years. The probability is that the earlier and more 
    remarkable designations were made by God Himself even before the Flood. Josephus 
    attributes the invention of the constellations to the family of Seth, the 
    son of Adam...Origen affirms that it was asserted in the Book of Enoch that 
    in the time of the patriarchs the constellations were already divided and 
    named. Volney informs us that everywhere in antiquity there was a cherished 
    tradition of an expected conqueror of the Serpent, and asserts that this tradition 
    is reflected in the constellations as well as in all the heathen mythologies...It 
    is impossible to doubt that astronomy was invented from the beginning of the 
    world; history, profane as well as sacred, testifies to this truth...They

    building. THIS FINAL DOWNWARDNESS OF SEVEN TIMES IS STRIKINGLY SUGGESTIVE 
    OF THE DRAGON'S COMPLETE DETHRONEMENT. And what is still more remarkable, 
    while Draconis is on the meridian at this low point, Aries, the Ram, appears 
    on the meridian above, with the line passing exactly through his horns. A 
    MORE VIVID ASTRONOMICAL SIGN OF THE OVERTHROW OF SATAN UNDER THE DOMINION
