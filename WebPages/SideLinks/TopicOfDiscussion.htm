  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Martin Reese, author of &quot;Our 
    Final Hour,&quot; says that the world as we know it has only a 50-50 chance 
    of surviving the 21st century...</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">See, I have </font></i>(indeed)<i><font size="+1"> set

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Humans are a recent addition 
    to the cosmos. If the whole 10-billion-year projected lifetime of the sun 
    were compressed into one year, Reese writes, all of recorded history would 
    take up less than a minute, and the 20th century would amount to less than 
    a third of a second.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The unspoken assumption behind 
    it all, is that we as a life-form are just getting started, and that bigger, 
    mightier things lie ahead.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it might be, Reese suggests, 
    that the future of humanity is as slender a thread as its past. If we are 
    alone in the universe, and whether we survive or not will determine whether 
    there is <i>a point </i>to the rest of cosmic history. </font>A New York Times 
    Book Review.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The notion of whether there is <i>a point </i>to the rest of 
  cosmic history grows out of the linear assumptions about time and space, and 
  about history itself, that have gripped the thinking of the Western world since 
  the time of Augustine. This line of reasoning, which does not suppose, or even 
  suspect a structure and a pattern to historical events, falls under the academic 
  (purely intellectual) headings of <i>Preterism</i> and <i>Amillenialism</i>. 
  Preterists state that the prophetic events described in the books of Daniel 
  and Revelation have already been fulfilled, basically between the time of the 
  Christian revelation and the destructions of Jerusalem in the first and second 
  centuries; that the Roman emperors were the antichrists and that history since 
  that time is an open-ended affair. God might return to the world He created. 
  There is no real indication or specific promise of it. Everything in the prophets 
  is already fulfilled. In the meantime <i>conquer</i> and <i>occupy</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Amillenialists likewise hold that the <i>thousand years</i> 
  described in the Book of Revelation is purely symbolic (which it is, but for 
  reasons amillenialists cannot imagine). It is the time running from the Cross 
  of Christ to the next advent of Christ. This is the epic <i>Day of the Lord</i>. 
  It will culminate, not in foreseen events but in an unforeseen time way out 
  in the undetermined far-distant future, after the church-militant finally subdues 
  the darkened elements of human nature and delivers the earth and all of its 
  peoples back to God. This is the Augustinian world view, and goes so far as 
  to suggest that God's kingdom will never be actually be realized here on earth 
  at all, but only after death in the world beyond. This also leaves history as 
  an open-ended affair, and in a sense up for grabs. It is up to those in power 
  (by whatever social, economic and military means at their disposal) to sieze 
  upon each moment in history as it unfolds in order to bend it in the direction 
  that (ostensibly) the heads of western christendom say it should go. This world-view 
  passed from Rome (where it failed) to America via the Reformation, and in every 
  subtle way (un)informs the collective thinking of those who find themselves 
  in charge of the American empire's present global agenda. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE END OF HISTORY</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Francis Fukuyama 
  (1992)</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><br>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The distant origins of the present 
    volume lie in an article entitled &quot;The End of History?&quot; which I 
    wrote for the journal The National Interest in the summer of 1989. In it, 
    I argued that a remarkable consensus concerning the legitimacy of liberal 
    democracy as a system of government had emerged throughout the world over 
    the past few years, as it conquered rival ideologies like hereditary monarchy, 
    fascism, and most recently communism. More than that, however, I ARGUED THAT 
    LIBERAL DEMOCRACY MAY CONSTITUTE THE &quot;END POINT OF MANKIND'S IDEOLOGICAL 
    EVOLUTION&quot; AND THE &quot;FINAL FORM OF HUMAN GOVERNMENT,&quot; AND AS 
    SUCH CONSTITUTED THE &quot;END OF HISTORY.&quot; (continued)...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The point that we made in response to this and the following 
  articles and interviews is that:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THEY PAY NO HEED TO 
  THE HIDDEN MEANING OF THINGS</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They pay no heed to the real hidden 
    meaning of things, but divert themselves instead with all kinds of (natural, 
    three-dimensional thinking). They do not know the hidden meaning of what is 
    actually taking place, nor have they ever understood the lessons of the past. 
    Consequently they have no knowledge of what is coming upon them and have done 
    nothing to save their souls from the deeper implications of present events.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This, however, will symbolize things 
    for you. What is going to happen is, as it were, that all iniquity is going 
    to be shut up in the womb and prevented from coming to birth. Wrong is going 
    to depart before Right, as darkness departs before light. As smoke disappears 
    and is no more, so will Wrong disappear for ever. But Right will be revealed 
    like the Sun. The world will rest on a sound Foundation. All who cling to 
    (iniquitous thinking) will cease to exist. The world will be filled with knowledge, 
    and ignorance exist no more.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The thing is certain to come. The 
    prophecy is true, and by this you may know that it will not be revoked: Do 
    not all peoples hate wrongdoing? Yet is it not rampant among them all? Are 
    not the praises of truth sung by all nations? Yet is there a single race or 
    tribe that really adheres to it? What nation likes to be oppressed by a stronger 
    power? Or who wants his property plundered unjustly? Yet, is there a single 
    nation that has not oppressed its neighbor? Or where in the world will you 
    find a people that has not plundered the property of another? </font>The Triumph 
    of God, Descriptions of the Final Age. The Dead Sea Scriptures, by Theodor 
    H. Gaster, p.429<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven 
    set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not

    kingdoms, and it shall stand forever...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 
    2:44). </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Fukuyama continues)....That is, 
    while earlier forms of government were characterised by grave defects and 
    irrationalities that led to their eventual collapse, liberal democracy was 
    arguably free from such fundamental internal contradictions. This was not 
    to say that today's stable democracies, like the United States, France, or 
    Switzerland, were not without injustice or serious social problems. But these 
    problems were ones of incomplete implementation of the twin principles of 
    liberty and equality on which modern democracy is founded, rather than of 
    flaws in the principles themselves. While some present-day countries might 
    fail to achieve stable liberal democracy, and others might lapse back into 
    other, more primitive forms of rule like theocracy or military dictatorship, 
    THE IDEAL OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY COULD NOT BE IMPROVED UPON...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The original article excited 
    an extraordinary amount of commentary and controversy, first in the United 
    States, and then in a series of countries as different as England, France, 
    Italy, the Soviet Union, Brazil, South Africa, Japan, and South Korea. Criticism 
    took every conceivable form, some of it based on simple misunderstanding of 
    my original intent, and others penetrating more perceptively to the core of 
    my argument. Many people were confused in the first instance by my use of 
    the word &quot;history.&quot; Understanding history in a conventional sense 
    as the occurrence of events, people pointed to the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
    the Chinese communist crackdown in Tiananmen Square, and the Iraqi invasion 
    of Kuwait as evidence that &quot;history was continuing,&quot; and that I 
    was ipso facto proven wrong.</font></p>

      wherein the Highest shall begin to visit the world which he made.</font></i></p>

      of people in the world.</font></i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...And yet what I suggested had 
    come to an end was not the occurrence of events, even large and grave events, 
    BUT HISTORY. THAT IS, HISTORY UNDERSTOOD AS A SINGLE, COHERENT, EVOLUTIONARY 
    PROCESS, WHEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL PEOPLES IN ALL TIMES. 
    This understanding of History was most closely associated with the great German 
    philosopher C. W. F. Hegel. It was made part of our daily intellectual atmosphere 
    by Karl Marx, who borrowed this concept of History from Hegel, and is implicit 
    in our use of words like &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;advanced,&quot; &quot;traditional&quot; 
    or &quot;modern,&quot; when referring to different types of human societies. 
    For both of these thinkers, there was a coherent development of human societies 
    FROM SIMPLE TRIBAL ONES BASED ON SLAVERY AND SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE, THROUGH 
    VARIOUS THEOCRACIES, MONARCHIES, AND FEUDAL ARISTOCRACIES, UP THROUGH MODERN 
    LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY DRIVEN CAPITALISM. This evolutionary 
    process was neither random nor unintelligible, even if it did not proceed 
    in a straight line, and even if it was possible to question whether man was 
    happier or better off as a result of historical &quot;progress.&quot; (continued)...</font></p>

    suppose that the writers of the Scrolls and the men of Qumran were inspired 
    only by recollections of things past or that they chose their way of life 
    simply because they were unsettled by political turbulence or disgusted by 
    the venality of the Jerusalemitan priests. They were swept also by other winds. 
    ONE OF THESE WAS THE WIDESPREAD AND WELL-ATTESTED CONTEMPORARY BELIEF THAT 
    THE GREAT CYCLE OF THE AGES WAS ABOUT TO COMPLETE ITS REVOLUTION. This belief 
    was based on a conception, which can in fact be traced to remote Indian antiquity, 
    that existence consists not in linear progressive development--that is, in 
    'history'--but in a constant cyclic repetition of primordial and archetypal 
    events. WHEN MAJOR UPHEAVALS OCCURRED, IT WAS PROMPTLY SUPPOSED THAT THE CYCLE 
    WAS NEARING ITS END, THAT THE GREAT YEAR WAS AT HAND, AND THAT THE COSMOS 
    WAS ABOUT TO REVERT TO CHAOS </font>(before it returned to order again...Jeremiah 
    4:23)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. The primal elements, restrained 
    and regulated at the beginning of the world, would again be unleashed; all 
    things would dissolve in an overwhelming deluge (War) or be burned in that 
    everlasting fire which rages in the depths of the earth. THEN THE CYCLE WOULD 
    BEGIN AGAIN; A NEW WORLD WOULD BE BROUGHT TO BIRTH.&quot; </font>The Dead

    HAD ACHIEVED A FORM OF SOCIETY THAT SATISFIED ITS DEEPEST AND MOST FUNDAMENTAL 
    LONGINGS. Both thinkers thus posited an &quot;end of history&quot;: for Hegel 
    this was the liberal state, while for Marx it was a communist society. This 
    did not mean that THE NATURAL CYCLE OF BIRTH, LIFE, AND DEATH would end, that 
    important events would no longer happen, or that newspapers reporting them 
    would cease to be published. IT MEANT, RATHER, THAT THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER 
    PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES AND INSTITUTIONS, BECAUSE

<p><font size="+1">Of course, Fukuyama has left out the final synthesis of thought, 
  the one that emerges from the great ideological conflicts of the 20th century 
  (and now the 21st); the one that transcends the notions of Liberal Democracy 
  altogether; the one that is subject to no other authority but the truth; the 
  one that in turn submits itself willingly and wholeheartedly to the truth--one 
  that is still laboring to be born:</font></p>

  <p align="center"><i><font size="+1">__________</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Fukuyama)...The present book is 
    not a restatement of my original article, nor is it an effort to continue 
    the discussion with that article's many critics and commentators. Least of 
    all is it an account of the end of the Cold War, or any other pressing topic 
    in contemporary politics. While this book is informed by recent world events, 
    its subject returns to a very old question: WHETHER, AT THE END OF THE TWENTIETH 
    CENTURY, IT MAKES SENSE FOR US ONCE AGAIN TO SPEAK OF A COHERENT AND DIRECTIONAL 
    HISTORY OF MANKIND that will eventually lead the greater part of humanity 
    to liberal democracy? The answer I arrive at is yes, for two separate reasons. 
    One has to do with economics, and the other has to do with what is termed 
    the &quot;struggle for recognition.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is of course not sufficient 
    to appeal to the authority of Hegel, Marx, or any of their contemporary followers 
    to establish THE VALIDITY OF DIRECTIONAL HISTORY. In the century and a half 
    since they wrote, their intellectual legacy has been relentlessly assaulted 
    from all directions. The most profound thinkers of the twentieth century have 
    directly attacked the idea that history is a coherent or intelligible process; 
    indeed, they have denied the possibility that any aspect of human life is 
    philosophically intelligible. We in the West have become thoroughly pessimistic 
    with regard to the possibility of overall progress in democratic institutions. 
    This profound pessimism is not accidental, but born of the truly terrible 
    political events of the first half of the twentieth century &#151; TWO DESTRUCTIVE 
    WORLD WARS, THE RISE OF TOTALITARIAN IDEOLOGIES, AND THE TURNING OF SCIENCE 
    AGAINST MAN IN THE FORM OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. The life 
    experiences of the victims of this past century's political violence &#151; 
    from the survivors of Hitlerism and Stalinism to the victims of Pol Pot &#151; 
    would deny that there has been such a thing as historical progress. Indeed, 
    we have become so accustomed by now to expect that the future will contain 
    bad news with respect to the health and security of decent, liberal, democratic 
    political practices THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS RECOGNISING GOOD NEWS WHEN IT COMES.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AND YET GOOD NEWS HAS COME. The 
    most remarkable development of the last quarter of the twentieth century has 
    been the revelation of enormous weaknesses at the core of the world's seemingly 
    strong dictatorships, whether they be of the military-authoritarian Right, 
    or the communist-totalitarian Left. From Latin America to Eastern Europe, 
    from the Soviet Union to the Middle East and Asia, strong governments have 
    been failing over the last two decades. And while they have not given way 
    in all cases to stable liberal democracies, liberal democracy remains the 
    only coherent political aspiration that spans different regions and cultures 
    around the globe. In addition, liberal principles in economics &#151; the 
    &#147;free market&#148; &#151; have spread, and have succeeded IN PRODUCING 
    UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF MATERIAL PROSPERITY, both in industrially developed 
    countries and in countries that had been, at the close of World War II, part

  the unbridled production of wealth, the continued exploitation of the world's

    good luck. BY RAISING ONCE AGAIN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS SUCH A THING 
    AS A UNIVERSAL HISTORY OF MANKIND, I am resuming a discussion that was begun 
    in the early nineteenth century, but more or less abandoned in our time because 
    of the enormity of events that mankind has experienced since then. While drawing

    presents not one but two separate efforts to outline such a Universal History. 
    After establishing in Part I why we need to raise once again the possibility 
    of Universal History, I propose an initial answer in Part II by attempting 
    to use modern natural science as a regulator or mechanism TO EXPLAIN THE DIRECTIONALITY 
    AND COHERENCE OF HISTORY. Modern natural science is a useful starting point 
    because it is the only important social activity that by common consensus 
    is both cumulative and directional, even if its ultimate impact on human happiness 
    is ambiguous. The progressive conquest of nature made possible with the development 
    of the scientific method in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has proceeded 
    according to certain definite rules laid down not by man, BUT BY NATURE AND 
    NATURE'S LAWS.</font></p>

    for two reasons. In the first place, TECHNOLOGY CONFERS DECISIVE MILITARY 
    ADVANTAGE ON THOSE COUNTRIES THAT POSSESS IT, and given the continuing possibility 
    of war in the international system of states, no state that values its independence 
    can ignore the need for defensive modernisation. Second, modern natural science 
    establishes a uniform horizon of economic production possibilities. TECHNOLOGY 
    MAKES POSSIBLE THE LIMITLESS ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH, AND THUS THE SATISFACTION 
    OF AN EVER-EXPANDING SET OF HUMAN DESIRES. This process guarantees an increasing 
    homogenisation of all human societies, regardless of their historical origins 
    or cultural inheritances. All countries undergoing economic modernisation 
    must increasingly resemble one another: they must unify nationally on the 
    basis of a centralised state, urbanise, replace traditional forms of social 
    organisation like tribe, sect, and family with economically rational ones 
    based on function and efficiency, and provide for the universal education 
    of their citizens. Such societies have become increasingly linked with one 
    another through global markets AND THE SPREAD OF A UNIVERSAL CONSUMER CULTURE. 
    Moreover, the logic of modern natural science would seem to dictate a universal 
    evolution in the direction of capitalism. The experiences of the Soviet Union, 
    China, and other socialist countries indicate that while highly centralised 
    economies are sufficient to reach the level of industrialisation represented 
    by Europe in the 1950s, they are woefully inadequate in creating what have 
    been termed complex &quot;post-industrial&quot; economies in which information 
    and technological innovation play a much larger role. (Continued)...</font></p>

    of global corporations...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is also the crucial role 
    of television, which carries the &quot;homogenization mandate to another level 
    entirely--directly inside people's brains.&quot; By its ability to speak identical 
    imagery to billions of people on earth, TV is capable of unifying thoughts, 
    feelings, values, tastes and desires to match the needs of the institutions 
    who send these images. These are giant corporations, whose ideals of Utopia 
    are invariably commodity-oriented, urban, technology-oriented, AND INDIFFERENT 
    TO NATURE. The net result is the homogenized mental landscape that nicely 
    conforms to the franchise, freeways, suburbs, highrises and clearcuts of an

    TV than doing anything else in life besides working, sleeping or going to

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...According to Hegel, human beings 
    like animals have natural needs and desires for objects outside themselves 
    such as food, drink, shelter, and above all the preservation of their own 
    bodies. Man differs fundamentally from the animals, however, because in addition 
    he desires the desire of other men, that is, he wants to be &#147;recognised.&#148; 
    In particular, he wants to be recognised as a human being, that is, as a being 
    with a certain worth or dignity. This worth in the first instance is related 
    to his willingness to risk his life in a struggle over pure prestige. For 
    only man is able to overcome his most basic animal instincts &#151; chief 
    among them his instinct for self-preservation &#151; for the sake of higher, 
    abstract principles and goals. According to Hegel, THE DESIRE FOR RECOGNITION 
    initially drives two primordial combatants to seek to make the other &quot;recognise&quot; 
    their humanness by staking their lives in a mortal battle. When the natural 
    fear of death leads one combatant to submit, the relationship of master and 
    slave is born. The stakes in this bloody battle at the beginning of history 
    are not food, shelter, or security, BUT PURE PRESTIGE. And precisely because 
    the goal of the battle is not determined by biology, Hegel sees in it the 
    first glimmer of human freedom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The desire for recognition may 
    at first appear to be an unfamiliar concept, but it is as old as the tradition 
    of Western political philosophy, and constitutes a thoroughly familiar part 
    of the human personality. It was first described by Plato in the Republic, 
    when he noted that there were three parts to the soul, a desiring part, a 
    reasoning part, and a part that he called thymos, or &quot;spiritedness.&quot; 
    Much of human behaviour can be explained as a combination of the first two 
    parts, desire and reason: desire induces men to seek things outside themselves, 
    while reason or calculation shows them the best way to get them. But in addition, 
    human beings seek recognition of their own worth, or of the people, things, 
    or principles that they invest with worth. The propensity to invest the self 
    with a certain value, and to demand recognition for that value, is what in 
    today's popular language we would call &quot;self-esteem.&quot; The propensity 
    to feel self-esteem arises out of the part of the soul called emos. It is 
    like an innate human sense of justice. People believe that they have a certain 
    worth, and when other people treat them as though they are worth less than 
    that, they experience the emotion of anger. Conversely, when people fail to 
    live up to their own sense of worth, they feel shame, and when they are evaluated 
    correctly in proportion to their worth, they feel pride. The desire for recognition, 
    and the accompanying emotions of anger, shame, and pride, are parts of the 
    human personality critical to political life. According to Hegel, they are 
    what drives the whole historical process.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Hegel's account, the desire 
    to be recognised as a human being with dignity drove man at the beginning 
    of history into a bloody battle to the death for prestige. The outcome of 
    this battle was a division of human society into a class of masters, who were 
    willing to risk their lives, and a class of slaves, who gave in to their natural 
    fear of death. But the relationship of lordship and bondage, which took a 
    wide variety of forms in all of the unequal, aristocratic societies that have 
    characterised the greater part of human history, failed ultimately to satisfy 
    the desire for recognition of either the masters or the slaves. The slave, 
    of course, was not acknowledged as a human being in any way whatsoever. But 
    the recognition enjoyed by the master was deficient as well, because he was 
    not recognised by other masters, but slaves whose humanity was as yet incomplete. 
    Dissatisfaction with the flawed recognition available in aristocratic societies 
    constituted a &quot;contradiction&quot; that engendered further stages of 
    history.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hegel believed that the &quot;contradiction&quot; 
    inherent in the relationship of lordship and bondage was finally overcome 
    as a result of the French and, one would have to add, American revolutions. 
    These democratic revolutions abolished the distinction between master and 
    slave by making the former slaves their own masters and by establishing the 
    principles of popular sovereignty and the rule of law. The inherently unequal 
    recognition of masters and slaves is replaced by universal and reciprocal 
    recognition, where every citizen recognises the dignity and humanity of every 
    other citizen, and where that dignity is recognised in turn by the state through 
    the granting of rights...</font></p>

      unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon Him for?</font></i></p>

      and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this 
      day?...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 4:7,8).</font><i><font size="+1"> 
      </font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This Hegelian understanding of 
    the meaning of contemporary liberal democracy differs in a significant way 
    from the Anglo-Saxon understanding that was the theoretical basis of liberalism 
    in countries like Britain and the United States. In that tradition, the prideful 
    quest for recognition was to be subordinated to enlightened self-interest 
    &#151; desire combined with reason &#151; and particularly the desire for 
    self-preservation of the body. While Hobbes, Locke, and &#151; the American 
    Founding Fathers like Jefferson and Madison &#151; believed that rights to 
    a large extent existed as a means of preserving a private sphere where men 
    can enrich themselves and satisfy the desiring parts of their souls, Hegel 
    saw rights as ends in themselves, because what truly satisfies human beings 
    is not so much material prosperity as recognition of their status and dignity. 
    With the American and French revolutions, Hegel asserted that history comes 
    to an end because the longing that had driven the historical process &#151; 
    the struggle for recognition &#151; has now been satisfied in a society characterised 
    by universal and reciprocal recognition. NO OTHER ARRANGEMENT OF HUMAN SOCIAL 
    INSTITUTIONS IS BETTER ABLE TO SATISFY THIS LONGING, AND HENCE NO FURTHER 
    PROGRESSIVE HISTORICAL CHANGE IS POSSIBLE...</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The desire for recognition, 
    then, can provide the missing link between liberal economics and liberal politics 
    that was missing from the economic account of History in Part II. Desire and 
    reason are together sufficient to explain the process of industrialization, 
    and a large part of economic life more generally. But they cannot explain 
    the striving for liberal democracy, which ultimately arises out of thymos, 
    the part of the soul THAT DEMANDS RECOGNITION. The social changes that accompany 
    advanced industrialization, in particular universal education, appear to liberate 
    a certain demand for recognition that did not exist among poorer and less 
    educated people. As standards of living increase, as populations become more 
    cosmopolitan and better educated, and as society as a whole achieves a greater 
    equality of condition, PEOPLE BEGAN TO DEMAND NOT SIMPLY MORE WEALTH BUT RECOGNITION 
    OF THEIR STATUS. If people were nothing more than desire and reason, they 
    would be content to live in market-oriented authoritarian states like Franco's 
    Spain, or a South Korea or Brazil under military rule. But they also have 
    a thymotic pride in their own self-worth, and this leads them to demand democratic 
    governments that treat them like adults rather than children, recognising 
    their autonomy as free individuals. Communism is being superseded by liberal 
    democracy in our time because of the realisation that the former provides 
    a gravely defective form of recognition.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An understanding of the importance 
    of the desire for recognition as the motor of history allows us to reinterpret 
    many phenomena that are otherwise seemingly familiar to us, such as culture, 
    religion, work, nationalism, and war. Part IV is an attempt to do precisely 
    this, and to project into the future some of the different ways that the desire 
    for recognition will be manifest. A religious believer, for example, seeks 
    recognition for his particular gods or sacred practices, while a nationalist 
    demands recognition for his particular linguistic, cultural, or ethnic group. 
    Both of these forms of recognition are less rational than the universal recognition 
    of the liberal state, because they are based on arbitrary distinctions between 
    sacred and profane, or between human social groups. For this reason, religion, 
    nationalism, and a people's complex of ethical habits and customs (more broadly 
    &quot;culture&quot;) have traditionally been interpreted as obstacles to the 
    establishment of successful democratic political institutions and free-market 
    economies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the truth is considerably more 
    complicated, for the success of liberal politics and liberal economics frequently 
    rests on irrational forms of recognition that liberalism was supposed to overcome. 
    For democracy to work, CITIZENS NEED TO DEVELOP AN IRRATIONAL PRIDE IN THEIR 
    OWN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, and must also develop what Tocqueville called 
    the &quot;art of associating,&quot; which rests on prideful attachment to 
    small communities. These communities are frequently based on religion, ethnicity, 
    or other forms of recognition that fall short of the universal recognition 
    on which the liberal state is based. The same is true for liberal economics. 
    Labor has traditionally been understood in the Western liberal economic tradition 
    as an essentially unpleasant activity undertaken for the sake of the satisfaction 
    of human desires and the relief of human pain. But in certain cultures with 
    a strong work ethic, SUCH AS THE PROTESTANT ENTREPRENEURS WHO CREATED EUROPEAN 
    CAPITALISM, or of the elites who modernised Japan after the Meiji restoration, 
    work was also undertaken for the sake of recognition. To this day, the work 
    ethic in many Asian countries is sustained not so much by material incentives, 
    as by the recognition provided for work by overlapping social groups, from 
    the family to the nation, on which these societies are based. This suggests 
    that liberal economics succeeds not simply on the basis of liberal principles, 
    but requires irrational forms of thymos as well.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The struggle for recognition provides 
    us with insight into the nature of international politics. THE DESIRE FOR 
    RECOGNITION THAT LED TO THE ORIGINAL BLOODY BATTLE FOR PRESTIGE BETWEEN TWO 
    INDIVIDUAL COMBATANTS LEADS LOGICALLY TO IMPERIALISM AND WORLD EMPIRE. The 
    relationship of lordship and bondage on a domestic level is naturally replicated 
    on the level of states, where nations as a whole seek recognition and enter 
    into bloody battles for supremacy. Nationalism, a modern yet not-fully-rational 
    form of recognition, has been the vehicle for the struggle for recognition 
    over the past hundred years, and the source of this century's most intense 
    conflicts. This is the world of &quot;power politics,&quot; described by such 
    foreign policy &quot;realists&quot; as Henry Kissinger.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But if war is fundamentally driven 
    by the desire for recognition, it stands to reason that the liberal revolution 
    which abolishes the relationship of lordship and bondage BY MAKING FORMER 
    SLAVES THEIR OWN MASTERS should have a similar effect on the relationship 
    between states. Liberal democracy replaces the irrational desire to be recognised 
    as greater than others with a rational desire to be recognised as equal. A 
    world made up of liberal democracies, then, should have much less incentive 
    for war, since all nations would reciprocally recognise one another's legitimacy. 
    And indeed, there is substantial empirical evidence from the past couple of 
    hundred years that liberal democracies do not behave imperialistically toward 
    one another, even if they are perfectly capable of going to war with states 
    that are not democracies and do not share their fundamental values. Nationalism 
    is currently on the rise in regions like Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union 
    where peoples have long been denied their national identities, and yet within 
    the world's oldest and most secure nationalities, nationalism is undergoing 
    a process of change. The demand for national recognition in Western Europe 
    has been domesticated and made compatible with universal recognition, much 
    like religion three or four centuries before.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the course of the original 
    debate over the National Interest article, many people assumed that the possibility 
    of the end of history REVOLVED AROUND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE WERE VIABLE 
    ALTERNATIVES TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACY VISIBLE IN THE WORLD TODAY. There was a 
    great deal of controversy over such questions as whether communism was truly 
    dead, whether religion or ultranationalism might make a comeback, and the 
    like. But the deeper and more profound question concerns the goodness of Liberal 
    democracy itself, and not only whether it will succeed against its present-day 
    rivals. Assuming that liberal democracy is, for the moment, safe from external 
    enemies, could we assume that successful democratic societies could remain 
    that way indefinitely? OR IS LIBERAL DEMOCRACY PREY TO SERIOUS INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS, 
    CONTRADICTIONS SO SERIOUS THAT THEY WILL EVENTUALLY UNDERMINE IT AS A POLITICAL 
    SYSTEM? There is no doubt that contemporary democracies face any number of 
    serious problems, from drugs, homelessness and crime to environmental damage 
    and the frivolity of consumerism. But these problems are not obviously insoluble 
    on the basis of liberal principles, nor so serious THAT THEY WOULD NECESSARILY 
    LEAD TO THE COLLAPSE OF A SOCIETY AS A WHOLE, AS COMMUNISM COLLAPSED IN THE 
    1980s...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Writing in the twentieth century, 
    Hegel's great interpreter, Alexandre Koj&egrave;ve, asserted intransigently 
    that history had ended because what he called the &#147;universal and homogeneous 
    state&#148; &#151; what we can understand as liberal democracy &#151; definitely 
    solved the question of recognition by replacing the relationship of lordship 
    and bondage with universal and equal recognition. What man had been seeking 
    throughout the course of history &#151; what had driven the prior &#147;stages 
    of history&#148; &#151; was recognition. In the modern world, he finally found 
    it, and was &#147;completely satisfied.&#148; This claim was made seriously 
    by Koj&egrave;ve, and it deserves to be taken seriously by us. For it is possible 
    to understand the problem of politics over the millennia of human history 
    as the effort to solve the problem of recognition. RECOGNITION IS THE CENTRAL 
    PROBLEM OF POLITICS BECAUSE IT IS THE ORIGIN OF TYRANNY, IMPERIALISM, AND 
    THE DESIRE TO DOMINATE. But while it has a dark side, it cannot simply be 
    abolished from political life, because it is simultaneously the psychological 
    ground for political virtues like courage, public-spiritedness, and justice. 
    All political communities must make use of the desire for recognition, while 
    at the same time protecting themselves from its destructive effects. If contemporary 
    constitutional government has indeed found a formula whereby all are recognised 
    in a way that nonetheless avoids the emergence of tyranny, then it would indeed 
    have a special claim to stability and longevity among the regimes that have 
    emerged on earth...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But is the recognition available 
    to citizens of contemporary liberal democracies &quot;completely satisfying?&quot; 
    The long-term future of liberal democracy, AND THE ALTERNATIVES TO IT THAT 
    MAY ONE DAY ARISE, depend above all on the answer to this question. In Part 
    V we sketch two broad responses, from the Left and the Right, respectively. 
    The Left would say that universal recognition in liberal democracy is necessarily 
    incomplete because capitalism creates economic inequality and requires a division 
    of labor that ipso facto implies unequal recognition. In this respect, a nation's 
    absolute level of prosperity provides no solution, because there will continue 
    to be those who are relatively poor and therefore invisible as human beings 
    to their fellow citizens. Liberal democracy, in other words, continues to 
    recognise equal people unequally.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">Who shall live...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ezekiel, 
      chapter 18).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second, and in my view more 
    powerful, criticism of universal recognition comes from the Right that was 
    profoundly concerned with the leveling effects of the French Revolution's 
    commitment to human equality. This Right found its most brilliant spokesman 
    in the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whose views were in some respects 
    anticipated by that great observer of democratic societies, Alexis de Tocqueville. 
    Nietzsche believed that modern democracy represented not the self-mastery 
    of former slaves, but the unconditional victory of the slave and a kind of 
    slavish morality. The typical citizen of a liberal democracy was a &quot;last 
    man&quot; who, schooled by the founders of modern liberalism, gave up prideful 
    belief in his or her own superior worth in favour of comfortable self-preservation. 
    Liberal democracy produced &quot;men without chests,&quot; composed of desire 
    and reason but lacking thymos, clever at finding new ways to satisfy a host 
    of petty wants through the calculation of long-term self-interest. The last 
    man had no desire to be recognised as greater than others, and without such 
    desire no excellence or achievement was possible. Content with his happiness 
    and unable to feel any sense of shame for being unable to rise above those 
    wants, the last man ceased to be human.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following Nietzsche's line of thought, 
    we are compelled to ask the following questions: Is not the man who is completely 
    satisfied by nothing more than universal and equal recognition something less 
    than a full human being, indeed, an object of contempt, a &quot;last man&quot; 
    with neither striving nor aspiration? IS THERE NOT A SIDE OF THE HUMAN PERSONALITY 
    THAT DELIBERATELY SEEKS OUT STRUGGLE, DANGER, RISK, AND DARING, AND WILL THIS 
    SIDE NOT REMAIN UNFULFILLED BY THE &quot;PEACE AND PROSPERITY&quot; OF CONTEMPORARY 
    LIBERAL DEMOCRACY? Does not the satisfaction of certain human beings depend 
    on recognition that is inherently unequal? Indeed, does not the desire for 
    unequal recognition constitute the basis of a livable life, not just for bygone 
    aristocratic societies, but also in modern liberal democracies? Will not their 
    future survival depend, to some extent, on the degree to which their citizens 
    seek to be recognised not just as equal, but as superior to others? And might 
    not the fear of becoming contemptible &quot;last men&quot; not lead men to 
    assert themselves in new and unforeseen ways, EVEN TO THE POINT OF BECOMING 
    ONCE AGAIN BESTIAL &quot;FIRST MEN&quot; ENGAGED IN BLOODY BATTLES, THIS TIME 
    WITH MODERN WEAPONS?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This books seeks to address these 
    questions. They arise naturally once we ask whether there is such a thing 
    as progress, and whether we can construct a coherent and directional Universal

    busy to consider the latter question seriously for the better part of this 
    century. But the fading of these totalitarianisms, as the century comes to 
    an end, invites us to raise this old question one more time.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alvin Toffler's understanding of 
    power as three aspects 1) Wealth 2) Authority 3)Knowledge. This can become 
    a useful model for application within organisations. Too often people associate 
    &quot;power&quot; with &quot;authority&quot; only e.g. CEO with institutionalised 
    authority has &quot;power to change things, to make things happen&quot;, ignoring 
    other more enduring power :&quot;Knowledge&quot;. This leads to conclusion 
    and slogan in management literature that &quot;CEO must be committed (implying 
    he has the power, which is actually the authority, to implement change). Much 
    opportunities are lost in the pursuit of organisation excellence, generating 
    stress and frustration, WHEN LITTLE ATTENTION IS MADE ON &quot;KNOWLEDGE&quot; 
    AS AN ENDURING SOURCE OF POWER. &quot;Knowledge&quot; needs not necessary 
    reside in those with institutionalised authority. Illustration of &quot;Knowledge&quot; 
    power on a societal scale that causes power-shift by Alvin Toffler's certainly

    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For twenty-five years, Alvin Toffler 
    has been shocking us with his descriptions of the future. From Future Shock 
    to The Third Wave, Toffler has argued that we are involved in nothing less 
    than a change of civilization - as profound as that from hunter-gatherer to 
    agricultural, from agricultural to industrial. Now back with a new book, War 
    and Anti-War, Toffler is as provocative as ever, as he examines the increasingly 
    bloody consequences of cultures in collision as the Digital Revolution gathers 
    force. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most successful futurists don't 
    predict the future. THEY MAKE THEIR FORTUNE BY INTERPRETING THE PRESENT IN 
    A NEW WAY - a way that makes more sense and seems more conventional the farther 
    into the future one goes. Alvin Toffler made his fortune by explaining the 
    strange dread people were beginning to feel about rapid technological change 
    in the late 1960s. The official future was supposed to be groovy, but few 
    felt that way. In 1965, Toffler called the dread &quot;future shock&quot; 
    and then so christened his soon-to- be best-selling book in 1970. A decade 
    later Toffler followed up with another best-selling study of the present time, 
    called Third Wave. It painted a portrait of a world being reconstructed by 
    information. Powershift appeared the next decade - which late 1980s Toffler 
    saw in a new global perspective where knowledge begot the Haves while ignorance 
    begot the Have Nots. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's now 1993. Change has accelerated 
    and Toffler has published his once-a- decade blockbuster book three years 
    into the decade. Called War and Anti- War, it is co-authored by his wife, 
    Heidi Toffler, who also co-authored the earlier books. Their new book is about 
    learning from war, AND ABOUT HOW WE CAN ENGINEER PEACE WITH THE SAME TECHNOLOGY 
    WE ARE USING TO MAKE MONEY AND WAR.</font></p>

    <p><i><font size="+1">The ways of peace they know not; and there is no judgment

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At one time, both Heidi and Alvin 
    Toffler worked in grimy factories and on assembly lines in the Midwest. This, 
    they said, &quot;provided a graduate course in reality after our university 
    years.&quot; Since the success of their earlier books, they have had access 
    to most of the world's leaders. Late this past summer Alvin Toffler spoke 
    to futurist Peter Schwartz on assignment from Wired. Schwartz, co-founder 
    of the Global Business Network, advises the Pentagon and large corporations 
    on how to adapt to the new realities of an information-based world. Toffler, 
    quiet but confident, listened as much as he talked. As he tried to describe 
    this moment in history, he seemed to always have in mind Joe and Jane Sixpack, 
    confused by the present and worried about their jobs. - Kevin Kelly </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PETER SCHWARTZ: You've been writing 
    publicly about the future for a quarter of a century. It's almost exactly 
    25 years since Future Shock. I recently had my 25th college reunion, and I 
    was asked to give the speech. So I looked back and asked, &quot;What did we 
    expect was going to happen, but didn't?&quot; If you look back now, what were 
    the important things that really surprised you? I mean, the really big things 
    that you didn't anticipate? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ALVIN TOFFLER: When we go back 
    to Future Shock, the central errors that we can find are (a) it was not radical 
    enough, although it was seen as extremely radical at the time, and (b) we 
    made the mistake of believing the economists of the time. They were saying, 
    as you may recall, we've got this problem of economic growth licked. All we 
    need to do is fine-tune the system. And we bought it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We said, quite correctly, that 
    the period we are moving into is not the period of the crisis of communism 
    or the crisis of capitalism, but the general crisis of industrialism. We were 
    right. However, we did not yet see the tremendous economic upheavals that 
    implied. We thought, okay, we've got that problem solved, let's go on to other 
    problems. We were young, and still willing to listen TO LINEAR ECONOOMIC EXTRAPOLATIONS. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm not sure everybody got the 
    basic argument of Future Shock. We were not only saying that ACCELERATED CHANGE 
    is hard to adapt to, but that acceleration itself has effects on the system. 
    The ability to adapt isn't dependent entirely on whether you're going in what 
    you would regard as a happy direction or an unhappy direction. It's the speed 
    itself that compels a change in the rate of decision making, and all decision 
    systems have limits as to how fast they can make complex decisions. That takes 
    us to the computer. The early assumptions were that the giant brain was going 
    to solve our problem for us, that it was going to get all this information 
    together and that therefore life would be simplified. What it overlooked was 
    the fact that computers also complexify reality. And of course this was a 
    great disappointment to the Soviets because they were going to centrally plan 
    their thing with a big computer. </font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: There were three big things 
    that surprised my reunion class: the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rise 
    of the role of women in society, and the fact that powerful computers became 
    personal computers... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: I once had a class of 15-year-old 
    high school kids and I gave them index cards, and I said, &quot;Write down 
    seven things that will happen in the future.&quot; They said there would be 
    revolutions and presidents would be assassinated, and we would all drown in 
    ecological sludge. A very dramatic series of events. But I noticed that of 
    the 198 items that they handed in, only six used the word &quot;I.&quot; So 
    I gave them another set of cards, and I said, &quot;Now I want you to write 
    down seven things that are going to happen to you.&quot; Back came, &quot;I 
    will be married when I'm 21,&quot; &quot;I will live in the same neighborhood, 
    I will have a dog.&quot; And the disjuncture between the world that they were 
    seeing out there and their own presuppositions was amazing We thought about 
    this, and concluded on the basis of just guesswork that the image of reality 
    that they're getting from the media is one of high-speed rapid change, and 
    the image that they're getting in their classrooms is one of no change at 
    all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The collapse of the Soviet Union 
    was not among the big surprises for us. The economist Ludwig von Mises wrote 
    in the 1920s THAT THE ACHILLES HEEL OF SOCIALISM WAS WHAT HE CALLED THE PROBLEM 
    OF &quot;CALCULATION,&quot; WHICH WE WOULD TRANSLATE TODAY TO MEAN INFORMATION 
    OR KNOWLEDGE. Basically he was saying it was not possible for them to know 
    everything they needed to know to centrally plan the economy. The early stage 
    of industrialization - which usually involves heavy investment and the production 
    of capital goods - is the easy part. The hard part comes when you've got to 
    distribute the goods. For that you need more and more information, but the 
    Soviets created a system which guaranteed the falsification of the information 
    they received. Statistics coming in from every industry in the Soviet Union 
    were a pack of lies. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marx said that a &quot;revolutionary 
    situation&quot; arose in a country when its political and property relations 
    stifled economic and technological progress. And that was exactly what was 
    happening in the Soviet Union. Which is why, as early as 1982 or 1983, we 
    said that the Soviets faced a revolutionary crisis. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third-Wave Change </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: Information, including misinformation, 
    will change the world militarily and economically. If we look at global power, 
    in the broadest sense, the most basic division in the world was not between 
    East and West, but between industrial and nonindustrial powers. Between first 
    wave or agrarian countries, and second wave or industrial countries. That 
    two-way split in world power has dominated the planet for 300 years. WHAT 
    IS HAPPENING NOW IS A PROCESS OF WHAT WE CALL TRISECTION. THE WORLD IS SPLITTING 
    INTO THREE PARTS - THREE DIFFERENT LAYERS OR TIERS - OR MORE ACCURATELY THREE 
    DIFFERENT CIVILIZATIONS. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, you'll continue to have 
    agrarian countries and you'll continue to have the mass-manufacturing cheap-labor 
    suppliers, at least for a transitional period. But we are also rapidly developing 
    a chain of info- intensive countries whose economics depend not on the hoe 
    or the assembly- line but on brainpower. The people reading Wired are children 
    of THIS THIRD WAVE OF CHANGE. IT IS AN ENTIRELY NEW CIVILIZATION THAT IS STILL 
    IN ITS INFANCY. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We call it a civilization because 
    it's not just the technology that's changing. THE ENTIRE CULTURE IS IN UPHEAVAL. 
    ALL THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS DESIGNED FOR THE SECOND WAVE - FOR A MASS PRODUCTION, 
    MASS MEDIA, MASS SOCIETY - ARE IN CRISIS. The health system, the family system, 
    the education system, the transportation system, various ecological systems 
    - along with our value and epistemological systems. All of them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AND THE EMERGING THIRD-WAVE CIVILIZATION 
    IS GOING TO COLLIDE HEAD-ON WITH THE old first and SECOND CIVILIZATION. One 
    of the things we ought to learn from history is that when waves of change 
    collide they create countercurrents. When the first and the second wave collided 
    we had civil wars, upheavals, political revolutions, forced migrations. The 
    master conflict of the 21st century will not between cultures but between 
    the three supercivilizations - between agrarianism and industrialism and post- 
    industrialism. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Alvin Toffler is full of second wave assumptions. The newly 
  emerging third-wave (spiritual) civilization will embrace the old first-wave 
  civilization. Second-wave thinkers (the super globalists, industrialists and

  wave into the future. They have forgotten their lessons, Pharaoh's forces didn't 
  make it across.</font></p>

    IS VERY IMPORTANT, and it's related to the shifts from agrarianism to industrialism

    computer age,&quot; or &quot;the space age,&quot; or whatever, is that the

    moving through a society at the same time. And, if you then extend that idea 
    you can find many countries today in which you see multiple waves moving through 
    simultaneously. The primary example is Brazil, where, on the one hand, they're 
    still killing off tribal populations to make room for agriculture. So the

    revolution, or in our terminology &quot;the first wave of change.&quot; With 
    the coming of the industrial revolution, particularly the French Revolution 
    and Napoleon, you begin to get mass production, you begin to get mass conscription. 
    You begin to get machine guns for the machine society. With mass production, 
    you get mass destruction - industrialized warfare. And if we are now in the 
    process of transforming the way we create wealth, from the industrial to the 
    informational, or call it whatever you wish, there is a parallel change taking 
    place with warfare, of which the Gulf War gives only the palest, palest little 
    hint. The transition actually started back in the late-1970s, early-1980s, 
    to a new form of warfare based on information superiority. It mirrors the 
    way the economy has become information-dependent. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An important part of this will 
    be what we call &quot;knowledge strategies&quot; - social knowledge strategies, 
    national knowledge strategies, and so on. In military terms there will be 
    attempts to coordinate all the knowledge- intensive activities of the military 
    from education and training to high- precision weaponry to espionage to everything 
    that involves the mind - propaganda - into coherent strategies. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: What about anti-war? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: The same thing has to happen 
    to the way we make peace. More and more peace will depend on the acquisition, 
    processing, dissemination, and control of knowledge. Whether we're talking 
    about satellite surveillance of troop movements, or brain drains of nuclear 
    scientists, or more refined sensors, knowledge is at the heart of peace. Here's 
    just one example. It took two years for the United States to decide it ought 
    to set up Radio Free Serbia. Instead of debating whether the world should 
    send ground troops to the Balkans, or whether to use airstrikes, we should 
    have been using information and information technology to strengthen the peace 
    forces and moderates that exist in Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia - but who have 
    no access to the media. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: So, instead of airdropping 
    food, we ought to be airdropping - </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: We ought to be dropping receivers 
    Transmitters. Laptops. Fax machines. Camcorders. Tape. We could have parked 
    a transmitter right off the coast and bombarded the countryside with peace 
    propaganda or at least moderating information. Or just plain news. Indeed, 
    the question is, where the hell was CNN? Where the hell was NHK? Where was 
    BBC? If they just broadcast into there - </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: Sure. Back in '87 I was interviewing 
    Gorbachev's chief science advisor, Velakoff, and he was saying that his most 
    important priority was getting enough satellite dishes distributed around 
    the Soviet Union so that when the inevitable coup came, Moscow could no longer 
    control the airwaves. And that is exactly what happened Exactly what happened. 
    On the day of the coup in Moscow, they went for the TV station but it didn't 
    matter any more. 'Cause you could get CNN everywhere. But there's another 
    side to all this, though, in terms of the war/anti-war issue. If you look 
    around the world today, you can list approximately 51 significant conflicts 
    going on somewhere at any given time. US military forces are active in about 
    five places. But big conflict, big war seems to be a thing of the past. Are 
    we in a new era of lots of persistent low-level conflicts, what could be called 
    the &quot;era of chaos wars&quot;? </font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: Well, look at it this way. 
    We're going through a structural transformation - which you can call postmodern, 
    post-industrial, &quot;the third wave,&quot; whatever - and one of the characteristics 
    of that change is the demassification of production. We go from &quot;everything 
    has to be the same&quot; to custom production, small-run niche production. 
    If you look at the marketplace, we go from mass distribution and mass markets 
    to niche markets. And if you look at war we're going to niche economies and 
    niche warfare. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: But then if you carry the idea 
    of niche wars further - </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: But, let me say we do not accept 
    the idea that that means big wars are finished. And we do not accept the common 
    assumption that there is a kind of zone of peace - that democracies don't 
    fight. First of all, who says they stay democracies? And second of all, democracies 
    in the past have fought and democracies could fight in the future. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: But, let's carry the metaphorical 
    line of niche wars that you've laid out there a little further. One of the 
    phenomena we see with the advent of information technology and markets is 
    the ability to deal with smaller and smaller and smaller niches until we have 
    what we think of as the segment of one. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: That's right And that segment 
    of one will have his own nuke. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: Well, so my question is, do 
    we end up going the other way in the sense we won't target a country, we won't 
    target a division, but we do target a military leader? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: Exactly That's exactly what 
    we say we didn't do vis-a-vis Saddam, but what we will do. In fact there is 
    a kind of dialectic here. We've always believed that many of the changes that 
    we identify as carrying us into a third-wave civilization, or whatever, actually 
    re-create preindustrial conditions on a high-technology basis. And what you 
    then see is individual assassination. That's the way the Medicis did it It 
    creates a scary world, certainly not a serene and stable world. And it does 
    look a lot more like chaos theory than it does like equilibrium. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the key concepts which should 
    give every member of Congress and the President pause is the dominant belief 
    that the US is and will remain the sole global military superpower. After 
    the Gulf War it looked as though the US would have a 10- to 15-year lead. 
    But the fact is, the more knowledge- intensive military action becomes, the 
    more nonlinear it becomes; the more a small input someplace can neutralize 
    an enormous investment. And having the right bit or byte of information at 
    the right place at the right time, in India or in Turkistan OR IN GOD KNOWS 
    WHERE, could neutralize an enormous amount of military power somewhere else. 
    So it is no longer necessary to match battalion with battalion, tank with 
    tank, in order to neutralize the other guy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: But that implies a level of 
    sophistication on the part of the governments, the intelligence and military 
    organizations, even the media organizations involved, that in most countries 
    is rare. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: Don't think in terms of countries. 
    Think in terms of families. Think in terms of narco-traffickers. And think 
    in terms of the very, very smart hacker sitting in Tehran. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: Well, as you know, the Pentagon 
    has become concerned with information war, but I think they've defined it 
    fairly narrowly. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: Yes, that's our thesis. But 
    there is an untold history here. If you look at all of our big companies, 
    they're trying to restructure like crazy. Not terribly many have been dramatically 
    successful in going from demoralization to peak performance, but the US military 
    has. It's gone from the pits of post-Vietnam, drug-drenched, corrupt, bloated 
    bureaucracy into an elegant force. The Revolt of the Rich </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PS: My company [GBN] just completed 
    a major study on the future of Asia. And one of our conclusions was that China 
    figures so largely in whatever happens, you can't understand the future of 
    Asia without understanding the future of China. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AT: If that is the case, I think 
    the future is very dire.</font></p>

  How Jimmy Carter and I Started the Mujahideen<br>
  Interview of Zbigniew Brzezinski Le Nouvel Observateur (France), Jan 15-21, 
  1998,</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: The former director of the CIA, 
    Robert Gates, stated in his memoirs [&quot;From the Shadows&quot;], that American 
    intelligence services began to aid the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan 6 months 
    before the Soviet intervention. In this period you were the national security 
    adviser to President Carter. You therefore played a role in this affair. Is 
    that correct?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brzezinski: Yes. According to the 
    official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, 
    that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979. But 
    the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely otherwise: Indeed, 
    it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first directive for secret 
    aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, 
    I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion 
    this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Despite this risk, you were 
    an advocate of this covert action. But perhaps you yourself desired this Soviet 
    entry into war and looked to provoke it?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brzezinski: It isn't quite that. 
    We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability 
    that they would.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: When the Soviets justified their 
    intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement 
    of the United States in Afghanistan, people didn't believe them. However, 
    there was a basis of truth. You don't regret anything today?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brzezinski: Regret what? That secret 
    operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians 
    into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The day that the Soviets 
    officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter: We now have the 
    opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war. Indeed, for almost 10 years, 
    Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that 
    brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: And neither do you regret having 
    supported the Islamic [integrisme], having given arms and advice to future 
    terrorists?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brzezinski: What is most important 
    to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? 
    Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of 
    the cold war?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Some stirred-up Moslems? But 
    it has been said and repeated: Islamic fundamentalism represents a world menace 
    today.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brzezinski: Nonsense! It is said 
    that the West had a global policy in regard to Islam. That is stupid. There 
    isn't a global Islam. Look at Islam in a rational manner and without demagoguery 
    or emotion. It is the leading religion of the world with 1.5 billion followers. 
    But what is there in common among Saudi Arabian fundamentalism, moderate Morocco, 
    Pakistan militarism, Egyptian pro-Western or Central Asian secularism? Nothing 
    more than what unites the Christian countries.</font></p>

    Primacy And It's Geostrategic Imperatives,&quot; Zbigniew Brzezinski, Basic 
    Books, 1997. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are the very first words 
    in the book: &quot;Ever since the continents started interacting politically, 
    some five hundred years ago, Eurasia has been the center of world power.&quot;- 
    p. xiii.&aelig; Eurasia is all of the territory east of Germany and Poland, 
    stretching all the way through Russia and China to the Pacific Ocean. It includes 
    the Middle East and most of the Indian subcontinent. The key to controlling 
    Eurasia, says Brzezinski, is controlling the Central Asian Republics. And 
    the key to controlling the Central Asian republics is Uzbekistan. Thus, it 
    comes as no surprise that Uzbekistan was forcefully mentioned by President 
    George W. Bush in his address to a joint session of Congress, just days after 
    the attacks of September 11, as the very first place that the U.S. military 
    would be deployed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As FTW has documented in previous 
    stories, major deployments of U.S. and British forces had taken place before 
    the attacks. And the U.S. Army and the CIA had been active in Uzbekistan for 
    several years. There is now evidence that what the world is witnessing is 
    a cold and calculated war plan - at least four years in the making - and that, 
    from reading Brzezinski's own words about Pearl Harbor, the World Trade Center 
    attacks were just the trigger needed to set the final conquest in motion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FTW, November 7, 2001, 1200 PST 
    (Revised Jan. 21,2001) - There's a quote often attributed to Allen Dulles 
    after it was noted that the final 1964 report of the Warren Commission on 
    the assassination of JFK contained dramatic inconsistencies. Those inconsistencies, 
    in effect, disproved the Commission's own final conclusion that Lee Harvey 
    Oswald acted alone on November 22, 1963. Dulles, a career spy, Wall Street 
    lawyer, the CIA director whom JFK had fired after the 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco 
    - and the Warren Commission member who took charge of the investigation and 
    final report - is reported to have said, &quot;The American people don't read.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some Americans do read. So do Europeans 
    and Asians and Africans and Latin Americans.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">World events since the attacks 
    of September 11, 2001 have not only been predicted, but also planned, orchestrated 
    and - as their architects would like to believe - controlled. The current 
    Central Asian war is not a response to terrorism, nor is it a reaction to 
    Islamic fundamentalism. It is in fact, in the words of one of the most powerful 
    men on the planet, the beginning of a final conflict before total world domination 
    by the United States leads to the dissolution of all national governments. 
    This, says Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member and former Carter National 
    Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, will lead to nation states being incorporated 
    into a new world order, controlled solely by economic interests as dictated 
    by banks, corporations and ruling elites concerned with the maintenance (by 
    manipulation and war) of their power. As a means of intimidation for the unenlightened 
    reader who happens upon this frightening plan - the plan of the CFR - Brzezinski 
    offers the alternative of a world in chaos unless the U.S. controls the planet 
    by whatever means are necessary and likely to succeed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This position is corroborated by 
    Dr. Johannes B. Koeppl, Ph.D. a former German defense ministry official and 
    advisor to former NATO Secretary General Manfred Werner. On November 6, he 
    told FTW, &quot;The interests behind the Bush Administration, such as the 
    CFR, The Trilateral Commission - founded by Brzezinski for David Rockefeller 
    - and the Bilderberger Group, have prepared for and are now moving to implement 
    open world dictatorship within the next five years. They are not fighting 
    against terrorists. They are fighting against citizens.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brzezinski's own words - laid against 
    the current official line that the United States is waging a war to end terrorism 
    - are self-incriminating. In an ongoing series of articles, FTW has consistently 
    established that the U.S. government had foreknowledge of the World Trade 
    Center attacks and chose not to stop them because it needed to secure public 
    approval for a war that is now in progress. It is a war, as described by Vice 
    President Dick Cheney, &quot;that may not end in our lifetimes.&quot; What 
    that means is that it will not end until all armed groups, anywhere in the 
    world, which possess the political, economic or military ability to resist 
    the imposition of this dictatorship, have been destroyed. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are the &quot;terrorists&quot; 
    the U.S. now fights in Afghanistan and plans to soon fight all over the globe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before exposing Brzezinski (and 
    those he represents) with his own words, or hearing more from Dr. Koeppl, 
    it is worthwhile to take a look at Brzezinski's background.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to his resume Brzezinski, 
    holding a 1953 Ph.D. from Harvard, lists the following achievements: Counselor, 
    Center for Strategic and International Studies Professor of American Foreign 
    Policy, Johns Hopkins University National Security Advisor to President Jimmy 
    Carter (1977-81); Trustee and founder of the Trilateral Commission; International 
    advisor of several major US/Global corporations; Associate of Henry Kissinger; 
    Under Ronald Reagan - member of NSC-Defense Department Commission on Integrated 
    Long-Term Strategy; Under Ronald Reagan - member of the President's Foreign 
    Intelligence Advisory Board; Past member, Board of Directors, The Council 
    on Foreign Relations; 1988 - Co-chairman of the Bush National Security Advisory 
    Task Force. Brzezinski is also a past attendee and presenter at several conferences 
    of the Bilderberger group - a non-partisan affiliation of the wealthiest and 
    most powerful families and corporations on the planet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Grand Chessboard</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brzezinski sets the tone for his 
    strategy by describing Russia and China as the two most important countries 
    - almost but not quite superpowers - whose interests that might threaten the 
    U.S. in Central Asia. Of the two, Brzezinski considers Russia to be the more 
    serious threat. Both nations border Central Asia. In a lesser context he describes 
    the Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Iran and Kazakhstan as essential &quot;lesser&quot; 
    nations that must be managed by the U.S. as buffers or counterweights to Russian 
    and Chinese moves to control the oil, gas and minerals of the Central Asian 
    Republics (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He also notes, quite clearly (p. 
    53) that any nation that might become predominant in Central Asia would directly 
    threaten the current U.S. control of oil resources in the Persian Gulf. In 
    reading the book it becomes clear why the U.S. had a direct motive for the 
    looting of some $300 billion in Russian assets during the 1990s, destabilizing 
    Russia's currency (1998) and ensuring that a weakened Russia would have to 
    look westward to Europe for economic and political survival, rather than southward 
    to Central Asia. A dependent Russia would lack the military, economic and 
    political clout to exert influence in the region and this weakening of Russia 
    would explain why Russian President Vladimir Putin has been such a willing 
    ally of U.S. efforts to date. (See FTW Vol. IV, No. 1 - March 31, 2001)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An examination of selected quotes 
    from &quot;The Grand Chessboard,&quot; in the context of current events reveals 
    the darker agenda behind military operations that were planned long before 
    September 11th, 2001.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;...The last decade of the 
    twentieth century has witnessed a tectonic shift in world affairs. For the 
    first time ever, a non-Eurasian power has emerged not only as a key arbiter 
    of Eurasian power relations but also as the world's paramount power. The defeat 
    and collapse of the Soviet Union was the final step in the rapid ascendance 
    of a Western Hemisphere power, THE UNITED STATES, AS THE SOLE AND, INDEED, 
    THE FIRST TRULY GLOBAL POWER... (p. xiii)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;... But in the meantime, 
    it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger emerges, capable of dominating 
    Eurasia and thus of also challenging America. The formulation of a comprehensive 
    and integrated Eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book. 
    (p. xiv)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The attitude of the American 
    public toward the external projection of American power has been much more 
    ambivalent. The public supported America's engagement in World War II largely 
    because of the shock effect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. (pp 24-5)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For America, the chief geopolitical 
    prize is Eurasia... Now a non-Eurasian power is preeminent in Eurasia - and 
    America's global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively 
    its preponderance on the Eurasian continent is sustained. (p.30)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;America's withdrawal from 
    the world or because of the sudden emergence of a successful rival - would 
    produce massive international instability. It would prompt global anarchy.&quot;

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Eurasia is the globe's largest 
    continent and is geopolitically axial. A power that dominates Eurasia would 
    control two of the world's three most advanced and economically productive 
    regions. A mere glance at the map also suggests that control over Eurasia 
    would almost automatically entail Africa's subordination, rendering the Western 
    Hemisphere and Oceania geopolitically peripheral to the world's central continent. 
    About 75 per cent of the world's people live in Eurasia, and most of the world's 
    physical wealth is there as well, both in its enterprises and underneath its 
    soil. Eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the world's GNP and about three-fourths 
    of the world's known energy resources.&quot; (p.31)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also a fact that America 
    is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad. This limits the use of 
    America's power, especially its capacity for military intimidation. Never 
    before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy. But the 
    pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion, except in conditions 
    of a sudden threat or challenge to the public's sense of domestic well-being. 
    The economic self-denial (that is, defense spending) and the human sacrifice 
    (casualties, even among professional soldiers) required in the effort are 
    uncongenial to democratic instincts. Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization.&quot; 
    (p.35)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Two basic steps are thus 
    required: first, to identify the geostrategically dynamic Eurasian states 
    that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international 
    distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their 
    respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to 
    attain them;... second, to formulate specific U.S. policies to offset, co-opt,

    and to keep the barbarians from coming together.&quot; (p.40)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Henceforth, the United States

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&aelig;&quot;Uzbekistan, nationally 
    the most vital and the most populous of the central Asian states, represents 
    the major obstacle to any renewed Russian control over the region. Its independence

    least vulnerable to Russian pressures.&quot; (p. 121)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Referring to an area he calls the 
    &quot;Eurasian Balkans&quot; and a 1997 map in which he has circled the exact 
    location of the current conflict - describing it as the central region of 
    pending conflict for world dominance - Brzezinski writes: &quot;Moreover, 
    they [the Central Asian Republics] are of importance from the standpoint of 
    security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate 
    and more powerful neighbors, namely Russia, Turkey and Iran, with China also 
    signaling an increasing political interest in the region. But the Eurasian 
    Balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize: an enormous 
    concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region, in 
    addition to important minerals, including gold.&quot; (p.124) [Emphasis added]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The world's energy consumption 
    is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades. Estimates 
    by the U.S. Department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by 
    more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015, with the most significant increase 
    in consumption occurring in the Far East. The momentum of Asia's economic 
    development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and 
    exploitation of new sources of energy and the Central Asian region and the 
    Caspian Sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that 
    dwarf those of Kuwait, the Gulf of Mexico, or the North Sea.&quot; (p.125)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Uzbekistan is, in fact, the 
    prime candidate for regional leadership in Central Asia.&quot; (p.130)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In fact, an Islamic revival 
    - already abetted from the outside not only by Iran but also by Saudi Arabia 
    - is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the increasingly pervasive

    hence infidel - control.&quot; (p. 133).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For Pakistan, the primary 
    interest is to gain Geostrategic depth through political influence in Afghanistan

    Asia with the Arabian Sea.&quot;&aelig; (p.139)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the long run, global politics

    the very last.&quot; (p.209)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Moreover, as America becomes

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Horror - And Comments From 
    Someone Who Worked With Brzezinski</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brzezinski's book is sublimely 
    arrogant. While singing the praises of the IMF and the World Bank, which have 
    economically terrorized nations on every continent, and while totally ignoring 
    the worldwide terrorist actions of the U.S. government that have led to genocide; 
    cluster bombings of civilian populations from Kosovo, to Laos, to Iraq, to 
    Afghanistan; the development and battlefield use of both biological and chemical 
    agents such as Sarin gas; and the financial rape of entire cultures, it would 
    leave the reader believing that such actions are for the good of mankind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While seconded from the German 
    defense ministry to NATO in the late 1970s, Dr. Johannes Koeppl traveled to 
    Washington on more than one occasion. He also met with Brzezinski in the White 
    House on more than one occasion. His other Washington contacts included Steve 
    Larabee from the CFR, John J. McCloy, former CIA Director, economist Milton 
    Friedman, and officials from Carter's Office of Management and Budget. He 
    is the first person I have ever interviewed who has made a direct presentation 
    at a Bilderberger conference and he has also made numerous presentations to 
    sub-groups of the Trilateral Commission. That was before he spoke out against 
    them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His fall was rapid after he realized 
    that Brzezinski was part of a group intending to impose a world dictatorship. 
    &quot;In 1983/4 I warned of a take-over of world governments being orchestrated 
    by these people. There was an obvious plan to subvert true democracies and 
    selected leaders were not being chosen based upon character but upon their 
    loyalty to an economic system run by the elites and dedicated to preserving 
    their power.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;All we have now are pseudo-democracies.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Koeppl recalls meeting U.S. Congressman 
    Larry McDonald in Nuremburg in the early 80s. McDonald, who was then contemplating 
    a run for the Presidency, was a severe critic of these elites. He was killed 
    in the Russian shootdown of Korean Air flight 007 in 1985. Koeppl believes 
    that it might have been an assassination. Over the years many writers have 
    made these allegations about 007 and the fact that someone with Koeppl's credentials 
    believes that an entire plane full of passengers would be destroyed to eliminate 
    one man offers a chilling opinion of the value placed on human life by the 
    powers that be.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1983, Koeppl warned, through 
    Op-Ed pieces published in NEWSWEEK and elsewhere, that Brzezinski and the 
    CFR were part of an effort to impose a global dictatorship. His fall from 
    grace was swift. &quot;It was a criminal society that I was dealing with. 
    It was not possible to publish anymore in the so-called respected publications. 
    My 30 year career in politics ended.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The people of the western 
    world have been trained to be good consumers; to focus on money, sports cars, 
    beauty, consumer goods. They have not been trained to look for character in 
    people. Therefore what we need is education for politicians, a form of training 
    that instills in them a higher sense of ethics than service to money. There 
    is no training now for world leaders. This is a shame because of the responsibility 
    that leaders hold to benefit all mankind rather than to blindly pursue destructive 
    paths.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We also need education for 
    citizens to be more efficient in their democracies, in addition to education 
    for politicians that will create a new network of elites based upon character 
    and social intelligence.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Koeppl, who wrote his 1989 doctoral 
    thesis on NATO management, also authored a 1989 book - largely ignored because 
    of its controversial revelations - entitled &quot;THE MOST IMPORTANT SECRETS 
    IN THE WORLD.&quot; He maintains a German language web site at www.antaris.com 
    and he can be reached by email at jbk@antaris.com. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As to the present conflict Koeppl 
    expressed the gravest concerns, &quot;This is more than a war against terrorism. 
    This is a war against the citizens of all countries. The current elites are 
    creating so much fear that people don't know how to respond. But they must 
    remember. This is a move to implement a world dictatorship within the next 
    five years. There may not be another chance.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE NEOCONS AND WOODROW 
  WILSON</font></p>
<p align="center">By PHILIP GOLD</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sunday, May 11, 2003. I know from 
    neocons. Midge Decter, the movement's grande dame, introduced me to journalism 
    in 1981. She and neocon&quot;godfather&quot; Irving Kristol helped get me 
    the grant for my first book. Throughout the '80s and much of the '90s, while 
    living in Washington, D.C., I worked with neocons, wrote for them, attended 
    their conferences, appeared with them on panels and occasionally drank their 
    whiskey. I still read their stuff and, for the most part, I like them as people. 
    But I also know that, in three critical ways, Joshua Muravchik's description 
    elides some unflattering truths.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, neoconservatism is a multigenerational 
    movement that has never really been conservative or fully accepted by the 
    mainstream, let alone the fringes. At its best, it was a valuable aberration. 
    Today, it's maligned. Second, although the younger neocons, the Boom X generation, 
    are Republicans, THEY DRAW THEIR DEEPEST SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION FROM WOODROW 
    WILSON. That's a dangerous liaison. And third, there's the matter of neocon 
    &quot;influence&quot; -- an issue that, sadly, cannot be divorced from the 
    tawdry subject of anti-Semitism and its present real and/or alleged reinvigoration. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEOCONSERVATISM, as Muravchik notes, 
    AROSE IN THE 70s AS A REACTION TO THE 60s. IT WAS AT FIRST A NEW YORK PHENOMENON 
    AND MOSTLY, though far from entirely, JEWISH. It reflected the sensibilities 
    of a unique generation of intellectuals, often starting out as the poor children 
    of immigrants, who made the long march from Brooklyn and City College of New 
    York and FDR for some and Trotsky for others, to that literary section of 
    Manhattan where they take their politics and their cocktail parties -- and 
    their book reviews -- very, very seriously. These were people of ideas, always 
    articulate and often brilliant, who'd also known depression, war, discrimination 
    and lives of unrelenting effort. They had struggled and succeeded. They were, 
    in short, full dues-paying members of the Greatest Generation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And neoconservatism was as much 
    their personal journey, their midlife crisis, as a political movement. Irving 
    Kristol, a founder of &quot;The Public Interest,&quot; and Norman Podhoretz, 
    former editor of &quot;Commentary&quot; and author of &quot;Making It,&quot; 
    have written movingly of this. THEIR BREAK WITH THE LEFT WAS PAINFUL AND COMPLEX, 
    BOTH A FAREWELL TO THEIR OWN GENERATION AND A REPUDIATION OF THE 1960s NEW 
    LEFT EXCESSES that their former friends' children had wrought. The children 
    they chided for their tantrums and immaturity, the parents for their excessive 
    tolerance and flaccidity in the face of barbarisms both foreign and domestic.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Midge Decter's &quot;Liberal Parents, 
    Radical Children&quot; can still be read with profit here. Indeed, many saw 
    liberalism's greatest failure AS A MATTER OF &quot;WILL&quot; AND &quot;NERVE,&quot; 
    two favorite neocon value-words, especially when dealing with communists and 
    kids. AND WHEN THEY TOOK UP RONALD (WILSON) REAGAN, it was his steady anti-communism 
    that they found most attractive. All in all, they were the right people at 
    the right time. THEY HELPED FASHION THE &quot;WILL&quot; AND THE &quot;NERVE&quot; 
    THAT BROUGHT THE SOVIETS DOWN. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nor are their children lacking 
    in will, certainly not in the chicken hawk sense -- an unfair epithet, but 
    not entirely inapt, APPLIED TO THOSE WHO URGE WAR and pander to bellicosity 
    BUT NEVER SERVED, OR WILL SERVE, THEMSELVES. What they are lacking is their 
    parents' depth and life experiences. And perhaps it is not too much to suggest 
    that the current leadership of the movement shows more than a trace of the 
    arrogance imputed to Boomer and Generation X left radicals, and of the infatuation 
    with their own theories that only those who've never been smacked upside the 
    head by reality (poverty, unfriendly fire, hard bigotry) can indulge. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What theories? Today, the Boomer/Generation 
    X neocons invoke icons of steadfastness such as Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan, 
    even Winston Churchill. But neocon writer and former Wall Street Journal editor 
    Max Boot caught it best some months ago WHEN HE DESCRIBED THEIR PREFERRED 
    FOREIGN POLICY AS &quot;HARD WILSONIANISM&quot;-- making the world safe for 
    democracy, THIS TIME WITH THE WILL AND THE NERVE AND THE POWER TO MAKE IT 
    STICK. Whatever else this may be, it is not conservatism, which holds these 
    truths to be self-evident: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">History does not begin anew with 
    us. We cannot force people to be free. Evil is real and, therefore, best we 
    take a modest, exceedingly modest, view of our ability to change human nature. 
    And speaking of human nature, power corrupts. It corrupts those who wield 
    it. And it corrupts those who seek to influence those who wield it. WHEN WOODROW 
    WILSON SAILED FOR THE VERSAILLES PEACE CONFERENCE IN 1919, HE TOOK WITH HIM 
    A TRAVELIING THINK TANK KNOWN AS &quot;THE INQUIRY.&quot; He exhorted these 
    young intellectuals, some of whom wrote for and most of whom read The New 
    Republic: &quot;TELL ME WHAT'S RIGHT AND I WILL FIGHT FOR IT!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WE'RE STILL TRYING TO CLEAN UP 
    THE MESS THOSE INTELLECTUALS MADE. And in some ways, from &quot;The New Republic&quot; 
    then to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; now, not that much of a change. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which brings us to the subject 
    of influence. Muravchik is right. Some of President Bush's policies &quot;resemble 
    things advocated by neocons,&quot; but &quot;Who knows how Bush decides?&quot; 
    (Does Bush always know?) And anyway, as Midge Decter wisely warned me, influence 
    can never be claimed. It can only be bestowed by those who are influenced. 
    What is bestowed can be taken away. Even the appearance of influence can lead 
    to an unpleasant backlash. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if you're Jewish, and high-visibility, 
    and associated with controversial policies and perilous actions, if your name 
    is Kristol (Irving or son Bill) or Podhoretz (Norman or son John) or Kagan 
    or Perle or Wolfowitz or Frum, backlash can get ugly. Is this happening? It's 
    hard to say. It's expected that the Arab press would run articles headlined, 
    &quot;PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF NEOCON.&quot; It's not surprising when neocons 
    such as David Brooks complain in print about anti-Semitic e-mails and phone 
    messages. It's business-as-usual when segments of the far right and the farther 
    left find themselves accused of bigotry masquerading as anti-Zionism, or anti-neoconism. 
    But it's something else entirely to hear, as I have, military officers speak 
    openly and contemptuously of &quot;the Likudniks in the E-Ring&quot; (Likud 
    being Ariel Sharon's party, the E-Ring the Pentagon corridor where the senior 
    leadership hangs out). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it's scary to realize that 
    the United States has undertaken to remake the Islamic world in our own image 
    and to our own satisfaction, by military conquest and occupation and the making 
    of examples, in order to encourage the others. And harder still to know that 
    the most prominent advocates of THIS NEW WILSONIAN IMPERIALISM are a small 
    group of public intellectuals with no significant political or cultural base 
    and scant knowledge of the nation beyond the Beltway or the world beyond their 
    abstractions. And it would be tragic, were a movement that did some good once, 
    to be remembered -- mostly for its part in marching the nation toward folly.</font></p>
