  <p><b>&quot;What emerges from this study? Above all, I suggest, the conclusion 
    that Fascism is nothing but monopoly capitalism imposing its will on those 
    masses whom it has deliberately transformed into slaves...a partnership between 
    monopoly capitalism and the Nazi Party in which that supreme coercive power 
    which is of the state's essence is used to compel obedience to the new system...</b></p>
  <p><b>There is no reason to suppose that any nation is so inescapably wedded 
    to democracy as to be free from the dangers of Fascism. Professor Brady shows 
    how profound are Fascist tendencies in the United States...</b></p>
  <p><b>The lesson of all foreign experience is that the governing class will 
    not permit the use of democratic institutions to abrogate its economic privileges. 
    So long as these institutions do not interfere with the basic structure of 
    Capitalism, they are respected. But so soon as they are used to attempt a 
    fundamental change in the incidence of economic power, faith in the validity 
    of democratic institutions is rapidly undermined. Indeed, the experience of 
    Western Europe makes it plain that the attempt need only be potential...</b></p>
  <p><b>The regime which the Nazis proceeded to establish is fairly described, 
    by the nature of the major interests which sponsored it, as a dictatorship 
    of monopoly capitalism. Its 'fascism' is that of business enterprise organized 
    on a monopoly basis, and in full command of all the military, police, legal, 
    and propaganda power of the state...</b></p>
  <p><b>(In its attempt)...It must divert the gaze of the masses from spiritual 
    to material things.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

<p align="center"><b>A Report on the Banality of Evil</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>by Hannah Arendt</b></p>
<p align="center"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><b>&quot;For it was history </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(God, 
      that is)</font><b> that, as far as the prosecution was concerned, stood 
      in the center of the trial. 'It is not an individual that is in the dock 
      at this historical trial, and not the Nazi regime alone, but anti-Semitism 
      throughout history.' </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(O that 
      they were wise, that they understood this...Deuteronomy 32:29)</font><b>. 
      This was the tone set by Ben-Gurion and faithfully followed by Mr. Hausner, 
      who began his opening address with Pharaoh in Egypt and Haman's decree 'to 
      destroy, to slay, and to cause them to perish.' He then proceeded to quote 
      Ezekiel: <i>And when I (the Lord) passed by thee, and saw thee polluted 
      in thine own blood, I said unto thee: In thy blood live, </i>explaining 
      that these words must be understood as 'the imperative that has confronted 
      this nation ever since its first appearance on the stage of history.' It 
      was bad history and cheap rhetoric; worse, it was clearly at cross purposes 
      with putting Eichmann on trial, suggesting that perhaps he was only an innocent 
      executor OF SOME MYSTERIOUSLY FOREORDAINED DESTINY, or for that matter, 
      even of anti-Semitism, which perhaps was necessary to blaze the trail of 
      'the bloodshed road traveled by this people' to fulfill its destiny.&quot; 
      </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eichmann in Jerusalem, p.19</font><b>.</b></p>
    <p><b>&quot;Eichmann's own attitude was different. First of all, the indictment 
      for murder was wrong: 'With the killing of Jews he had nothing to do. I 
      never killed a Jew, or a non-Jew, for that matter--I never (personally) 
      killed any human being. I never gave an order to kill either a Jew or a 
      non-Jew; I just did not do it.&quot;....Would he then have pleaded guilty 
      if he had been indicted as an accessory to murder? Perhaps he would have 
      made important qualifications. What he had done was a crime only in retrospect, 
      AND HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, because Hitler's orders, which 
      he had certainly executed to the best of his ability, had possessed <i>the 
      force of law</i> in the Third Reich.&quot; (pp.22-24).</b></p>
    <p><b>&quot;According to his (Eichmann's) religious beliefs, which had not 
      changed since the Nazi period (in Jerusalem Eichmann declared himself to 
      be a <i>Gottglaubiger</i>, the Nazi term for those who had broken with Christianity, 
      and he refused to take his oath on the Bible), this event was to be ascribed 
      TO A HIGHER BEARER OF MEANING, an entity somehow IDENTICAL WITH THE MOVEMENT 
      OF THE UNIVERSE, in itself devoid of higher meaning, is subject. (The terminology 
      is quite suggestive. To call God a <i>Hoheren Sinnestrager </i>meant linguistically 
      to give him some place in the military hierarchy, since the Nazis had changed 
      the military 'recipient of orders,' the <i>Befehlsempfanger</i>, into a 
      'bearer of orders,' a <i>Befehlstrager</i>, indicating, as in the ancient 
      'bearer of ill tidings,' the burden of responsibility and of importance 
      that weighed supposedly upon those who had to execute orders. Moreover, 
      Eichmann, like everyone connected with the Final Solution, was officially 
      a <i>bearer of secrets</i>...&quot; (p.27).</b></p>
    <p><b>&quot;When he was a child, his parents...had enrolled him in the Young 
      Men's Christian Association, from which he later went into the German Youth 
      Movement...A leaf in the whirlwind of time, he was blown into...the marching 
      columns of the <i>Thousand Year Reich, </i>which lasted exactly twelve years 
      and three months. <font size="2">(Consider Revelation 20:7-9)</font>. At 
      any rate, he did not enter the party out of conviction, nor was he ever 
      convinced by it--whenever he was asked to give his reasons, he repeated 
      the same embarrassed cliches about the Treaty of Versailles and unemployment; 
      rather, as he pointed out in court, 'IT WAS LIKE BEING SWALLOWED UP BY THE 
      PARTY AGAINST ALL EXPECTATIONS AND WITHOUT PREVIOUS DECISION. It happened 
      so quickly and suddenly.' He had no time and less desire to be properly 
      informed, he did not even know the Party program, he never read <i>Mein 
      Kampf.</i> Kalten Brunner said to him: Why not join the S.S.? And he had 
      replied, Why not? That was how it happened, and that was about all there 
      was to it....Of course, that was not all there was to it...From a humdrum 
      life without significance and consequence, the wind had blown him into History, 
      as he understood it, namely into a Movement that always kept moving and 
      in which somebody like him--already a failure in the eyes of his social 
      class, of his family, and hence in his own eyes as well--could start from 
      scratch and still make a career...&quot; (p.33).</b></p>
    <p><b>&quot;The German text of the taped police examination...constitutes 
      a veritable gold mine for a psychologist...Dimly aware of a defect that 
      must have plagued him even in school...he apologized, saying <i>'Officialese</i> 
      is my only language.' But the point here is that officialese became his 
      language because HE WAS GENUINELY INCAPABLE OF UTTERING A SINGLE SENTENCE 
      THAT WAS NOT A CLICHE...To be sure, the judges were right when they finally 
      told the accused that all he had said was 'empty talk'--except that they 
      thought the emptiness was feigned, and that the accused wished to cover 
      up other thoughts which, though hideous, were not empty. This supposition 
      seems refuted by a striking consistency with which Eichmann, despite his 
      rather bad memory, repeated word for word the same stock phrases and self-invented 
      cliches (when he did succeed in constructing a sentence of his own, he repeated 
      it until it became a cliche...The longer one listened to him, THE MORE OBVIOUS 
      IT BECAME THAT HIS INABILITY TO SPEAK WAS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH AN INABILITY 
      TO THINK, namely to think from the standpoint of somebody else. No communication 
      was possible with him, not because he lied but because he was surrounded 
      by the most reliable of all safeguards against the words and the presence 
      of others, and hence against reality as such.&quot; (p.48,49).</b></p>
    <p><b>&quot;IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE OUTBREAK OF WAR, on September 1, 1939, THAT 
      THE NAZI REGIME BECAME OPENLY TOTALITARIAN AND OPENLY CRIMINAL. One of the 
      most important steps in this direction, from an organizational point of 
      view, was a decree signed by Himmler, that fused the Security Service of 
      the S.S....which was a Party organ, with the regular Security Police of 
      the State, in which the Secret State Police, or Gestapo, was included. The 
      result of the merger was the Head Office for Reich Security (R.S.H.A.), 
      whose chief was first Reinhardt Heydrich...All officials of the police, 
      not only of the Gestapo, but also of the Criminal Police and the Order Police, 
      received S.S. titles corresponding to their previous ranks, regardless of 
      whether they were Party members, and this meant that in the space of a day 
      a most important part of the old civil services were incorporated into the 
      most radical section of the Nazi hierarchy...&quot; (p.69-71).</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

    exact copy of the symbol of the Nazi Waffin-SS. The USPS introduced it in 
    February 2001 as the innocuous sounding &quot;art deco&quot; eagle but in

  <p><b>Similarly, John Ashcroft christened another homeland security force the 
    &quot;Freedom Corps&quot;, evoking the &quot;Freicorps,&quot; the German army's 
    &quot;irregulars&quot; that cleared the way for Hitler by murdering social 
    democrats and communists. These allusions are sinister because the Third Reich 
    was an early attempt at a &quot;New World Order,&quot; and the Anglo American 
    business elite was involved with that up to its ears. Are these fascist allusions 
    coincidental? Or, is the elite coming out of the closet? </b></p>
  <p><b>Economist Robert Brady defined the Nazi state as &quot;a dictatorship 
    of monopoly capitalism. Its 'fascism' is that of business enterprise organized 
    on a monopoly basis, and in full command of all the military, police, legal 
    and propaganda power of the state.&quot; (Richard Sasuly, &quot;I.G. Farben,&quot; 
    1947, p. 128) </b></p>
  <p><b>Nazi Germany was a capitalist paradise. There was a 60-hour workweek, 
    low wages and no unions. Nazi expansionism represented the global ambitions 
    of German cartels that started preparing for war long before they financed 
    Hitler. As countries fell under the Nazi jackboot, they absorbed former competitors 
    at fire sale prices. &quot;For German big business, World War II was a chance 
    to plunder on a scale without precedent in history,&quot; writes Sasuly (p.114)... 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>During the war, the allies deliberately prevented Jews from escaping from 
    Europe. If someone sets a house on fire, and someone else blocks the exits, 
    don't they share equal blame? On the first day of World War Two, His Majesty's 
    ship &quot;Lorna&quot; fired on the limping overcrowded &quot;Tiger Hill&quot; 
    as she approached Palestine with 1417 Jewish refugees. The first people killed 
    by the British in WWII were not Germans but Jewish escapees from Germany. 
    Other refugee ships (e.g. the &quot;St. Louis&quot;) were sent back to Germany 
    by the US or blown up with all souls on board by British MI-6 (the &quot;Struma&quot;). 
    For the whole story, read &quot;The Holocaust Conspiracy&quot; (1989) by William 
    R. Perl, a Lt. Colonel with the US Army Intelligence Service. </b></p>
  <p><b>The list of US corporations that had the equivalent of $8 billion invested 
    in Nazi Germany include Standard Oil, General Motors, IBM, Ford, the Chase 
    and National City Banks, ITT and many others. As a result, the men of &quot;We 
    Were Soldiers&quot; didn't know that ITT built the airplanes that dropped 
    bombs on them. They didn't know that Ford and General Motors built the Nazi's 
    trucks and tanks. They didn't know that ball bearings crucial to the Nazi 
    war effort were manufactured in Philadelphia, yet were in short supply in 
    the USA. This was all done with the knowledge and permission of the US government. 
    For details, I recommend Charles Higham's &quot;Trading with the Enemy&quot;(1983). 
    Christopher Simpson's &quot;The Splendid Blond Beast&quot;(1993) and &quot;Blowback&quot; 
    (1988) are also useful. </b></p>
  <p><b>This information is shocking if we assume that cartels owe an allegiance 
    to their native country. This is not so. They live in a financial virtual 
    reality, a spiritual limbo divorced from common sympathy with their fellow 
    man. Their native countries are important only insofar as they provide patriots 
    to die for the advancement of their financial interests. </b></p>
  <p><b>If the elite backed the Nazis, why didn't the Nazis win? The elite also 
    backed the Allies. It doesn't matter which version of NW0 the elite gets. 
    The real money is in war and genocide itself. In addition, war degrades and 
    demoralizes humanity so it will accept serfdom. </b></p>
  <p><b>In conclusion, the Third Reich was an early attempt at the New World Order. 
    The purpose of this kind of &quot;globalization&quot; is to institutionalize 
    the political power of the cartels. This is the hidden agenda behind the current 
    &quot;war on terror,&quot; hence the fascist symbols and measures. </b></p>

  <p><b>Most of our nation's leaders are hod carriers for the cartels, particularly 
    oil. They are careerists who serve a class of people who have spiritually 
    seceded from the human race. This class holds us in bondage while it amasses 
    wealth that affords it neither peace nor joy. </b></p>
  <p><b>I leave you with a famous quotation by US President Theodore Roosevelt. 
    Uttered in 1906, it is relevant today because as long as cartels rule, the 
    human race is stalled. &quot;Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned 
    an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility 
    to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy 
    alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of 
    the statesmanship of today.&quot;</b> </p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Although the quest for or preservation of &quot;democracy&quot; is often 
    used as a justification for war, history has incessantly revealed that such 
    a quest is often little more than a thinly-veiled attempt to install a puppet 
    regime. Nazi leader Herman Goering once remarked&quot;THAT IT WAS EASY TO 
    LEAD A PEOPLE INTO WAR, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY RESIDED WITHIN 'A DEMOCRACY, 
    A FASCIST DICTATORSHIP, A PARLIMENT, OR A COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP.&quot; All 
    that was required, Goering argued, is for their government to &quot;tell them 
    they are being attacked, AND [THEN] DENOUNCE THE PACIFISTS FOR LACK OF PATRIOTISM 
    AND EXPOSING THE COUNTRY TO GREATER DANGER.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b> Many years ago, when I was younger and more idealistic, I would have 
    viewed Goering's statement as an anachronism. After all, millions had suffered 
    immensely during the nightmare of World War II, and it seemed that this historical 
    imprint alone would have indelibly reminded people about the folly of blindly 
    following leaders into war. Also (and despite Goering's assertion) democracy 
    appeared to offer additional protections from this folly as well, particularly 
    in wealthy, industrialized nations like America, where freedom of speech and 
    press permitted the free exchange of ideas, which in turn served to balance 
    emotion and reason, and exposed any lies used to rationalize an unjust war. 
    While it is true that America still suffered through the Vietnam era, it did 
    not do so unquestioningly, nor with a blind faith in the nation&quot;s leaders.</b></p>
  <p><b> But the coup by the plutocratic supporters of George W. Bush in the year 
    2000, coupled with the invasion of Iraq, changed all that, REVEALING HOW EASILY 
    AMERICANS CAN BE MANIPULATED, HOW WILLING THEY ARE TO BE LIED TO, AND HOW 
    VACUOUS THE FREEDOMS OF SPEECH AND PRESS HAVE BECOME WHEN THE BULK OF INFORMATION 
    IS FILTERED THROUGH CORPORATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA that profit from jingoism, 
    propaganda and dishonesty. But, perhaps most disturbingly, these events demonstrated 
    that even though the words &quot;freedom, democracy and human rights&quot; 
    are chanted like mantras by political leaders, many Americans have apparently 
    welcomed, or at the very least are blissfully unconcerned about, the erosion 
    of freedom, the abuse of human rights, and the nation&quot;s growing transformation 
    from a democracy into a neo-fascist dictatorship.</b></p>
  <p><b> Although the quest for or preservation of &quot;democracy&quot; is often 
    used as a justification for war, history has incessantly revealed that such 
    a quest is often little more than a thinly-veiled attempt to install a puppet 
    regime. Decades ago, the folk singer Phil Ochs, in his song COPS OF THE WORLD 
    (the lyrics of which are still hauntingly relevant today), stated that in 
    American lexicon democracy is simply another name for profits, and that in 
    poorer, &quot;third world&quot; countries democracy normally consists of an 
    imperialist power handpicking leaders for the local populace to &quot;elect.&quot; 
    The late Cuban guerrilla leader Che Guevara went even further, stating that 
    in these impoverished nations democracies are simply facades established by 
    imperialist powers to placate the masses, when in reality &quot;third-world&quot; 
    governments, burdened with debt and dependent upon wealthier nations for basic 
    necessities, frequently have to implement policies that appease their imperialist 
    masters even if it means the suffering of their own people. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>More recently PRAVDA columnist John Bourke examined this phenomenon in 
    the context of American efforts to allegedly install &quot;democracy&quot; 
    in Iraq (&lt;http://english.pravda.ru/mailbox/22/98/387/11401_iraq.htmlIraqi 
    Democracy or Our Iraqi Democracy, 12/1/03) by pointing out that the majority 
    of Iraq&quot;s population are from the Shiite sect of Islam, and a truly democratic 
    vote would undoubtedly place their representatives into power. This could, 
    Bourke explains, eventually lead to the establishment of a &quot;fundamentalist 
    Islamic state.&quot; Yet, despite all the Bush dictatorship&quot;s pretensions 
    about the Iraqi war bringing &quot;democracy to the region,&quot; Defense 
    Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has flatly stated that no government in Iraq, even 
    a democratically elected one, will be permitted to install an Islamic state. 
    After Rumsfeld revealed that the desire to promote democracy in Iraq was basically 
    a lie, another &quot;justification&quot; for the war became the need to defend 
    &quot;human rights.&quot; Clearly Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who 
    maintained power through the use of fear, torture, disappearances and mass 
    murders. But he was just one of many such dictators, some of whom are still 
    in power and supported by the United States. </b></p>
  <p><b>The reality is that it was not the violation of human rights that disturbed 
    the neo-fascist ideologies of the Bush dictatorship, but the fact that Hussein 
    had simply exhausted his usefulness. It is particularly revealing that the 
    demonization of Hussein came after he was no longer needed as an American 
    ally, just as, under the first Bush regime, the demonization of dictator Manuel 
    Noriega, and the subsequent invasion of Panama, occurred only after Noriega 
    was no longer needed as an American ally. Prior to this, the human rights 
    violations committed by both these men were routinely ignored, and sometimes 
    welcomed. As I reported in a previous PRAVDA article (&lt;http://english.pravda.ru/accidents/21/96/383/11003_Hoffman.htmlPolitics 
    of Assassination, 10/2/03), the CIA had on at least one occasion even turned 
    over to Hussein a list of suspected communists with the knowledge that those 
    on the list would be brutally tortured and executed. It was also revealing 
    that the invasion of Panama conveniently came at a time when Americans were 
    outraged about the billions of tax dollars they would be forced to pay to 
    bail out defunct &quot;savings and loans&quot; companies, whose financial 
    practices had resulted in the unjust enrichment of the few, and the loss of 
    life savings for the many. It is equally revealing that the invasion of Iraq 
    came while many, if not the majority of, Americans, felt that the corrupt 
    appointment of George W. Bush to the presidency had undermined democracy, 
    and that his inept handling of the economy was resulting in massive job losses 
    for the poor and middle-class, while the rich were benefitting from &quot;tax 
    cuts.&quot; <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>In addition, America's alleged &quot;respect&quot; for human rights continues 
    to be a lie, since one of the largest terrorist training camps in the world, 
    the School of the Americas, which is located within the boundaries of the 
    United States, still trains murderers, torturers and rapists whose atrocities, 
    primarily throughout Central and South America, make the number of people 
    killed by Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups pale in comparison. Ironically 
    (or perhaps not ironically) Manuel Noriega was a graduate of this &quot;school.&quot; 
    Of course all of the issues and facts discussed above are not &quot;deep, 
    dark secrets.&quot; But they also are not items Americans are likely to see 
    or hear while watching or listening to news broadcasts from corporate-controlled 
    media. These media are still licking their collective lips over the ratings 
    and profits windfall sired by the Iraqi war, and are certainly not going to 
    report upon anything that will prevent the Bush dictatorship from engaging 
    in more wars and invasions in the future. So it has become the province of 
    fictionalized dramas to expose what the jingoistic &quot;news&quot; media 
    want hidden. One example is the medical drama ER (short for &quot;Emergency 
    Room&quot;). In recent episodes an American doctor traveled to a war-torn 
    African country to provide medical services for the humanitarian organization 
    Doctors Without Borders. When asked why the American government's alleged 
    concern for human rights did not extend to Africa, he sadly remarked, &quot;They've 
    got no oil.&quot; Another aid worker later remarked that she was astonished 
    that Americans were not &quot;rioting in the streets&quot; in protest of the 
    deceptions that led to the Iraqi war.</b></p>
  <p><b> Although &quot;rioting in the streets&quot; would undoubtedly bring more 
    political repression, courtesy of America's megalomaniacal Attorney General 
    John Ashcroft and his so-called &quot;Justice Department&quot; (those who 
    saw the videotaped abuses inflicted on post 9/11 detainees clearly know what 
    this means), the lack of outrage in America against the lies, hypocrisy and 
    bloodlust of the Bush dictatorship, and those who support it, is frightening. 
    It would seem that all Americans, but particularly those with children or 
    other family members serving in Iraq, would be demanding impeachment after 
    seeing a bellicose Bush in military attire on the deck of an aircraft carrier, 
    since he avoided military service himself by joining the National Guard, and 
    then went absent without leave (AWOL) from that. </b></p>
  <p><b>It would seem Americans would be equally infuriated that other deceptive 
    instigators of the Iraqi war--like Dick Cheney, Karl Rove and Paul Wolfowitz--avoided 
    serving in the military. It would also seem that Americans would rebel against 
    those who not only undermined democracy to create the Bush dictatorship, but 
    who never even bothered to protect this democracy through military service--like 
    former Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, Bush&quot;s brother (and 
    Florida Governor) Jeb, and Supreme Court &quot;justices?&quot; Antonia Scalia 
    and Clarence Thomas. Finally it would seem that Americans would demand that 
    the political commentators and celebrities who supported the Iraqi war, yet 
    avoided serving in the military--like Sean Hannity, Joe Scarborough, William 
    Kristol, Bill O&quot;Reilly, Brit Hume, Kid Rock, Toby Keith, Ted Nugent, 
    Bruce Willis and numerous others--now &quot;put their money where their mouths 
    are&quot; by trading in their guitars, microphones, mansions and film careers 
    playing &quot;make-believe&quot; soldiers for rifles, military fatigues and 
    a &quot;real&quot; opportunity to get killed or maimed. After all, it is not 
    difficult to be &quot;brave&quot; when the lives at risk are not one&quot;s 
    own. </b></p>
  <p><b>But instead of outrage it appears that many Americans continue to be lulled 
    into complacency by lullabies of propaganda and deceit, while those who exploit 
    the war for self-aggrandizement and profit adroitly evade detection by camouflaging 
    themselves in counterfeit garments of &quot;patriotism.&quot;... Of course 
    some may argue that Hitler clearly was compelled by evil motives, while Bush 
    was compelled by &quot;benevolent&quot; ones. But this ignores the reality 
    that the primary difference between Bush and Hitler may simply be milieu, 
    not mind-set. In fact, actor/activist Harry Belafonte once courageously asserted 
    that the Bush administration is &quot;possessed of evil.&quot; These words 
    should not be dismissed as hyperbole. Hitler, after all, did not begin his 
    campaign for world domination until fascism was deeply entrenched in Germany. 
    The Bush dictatorship is still manufacturing this entrenchment. Given the 
    analogies above, one must wonder if history would have been so radically different 
    if George W. Bush and his war-crazed cronies were in power in 1938 Berlin 
    instead of 2004 America.</b></p>
  <p><b> Even a cursory study of American history reveals a nation that perpetually 
    swings, like a pendulum, from overreaction to regret. During these periods 
    of regret, the excesses and harms that overreaction generates are usually 
    cured. But, with the new millennium only a few years old, concerned Americans, 
    as well as the rest of the world, are now facing the prospect of the most 
    powerful country on earth metamorphosing into a neo-fascist nation, existing 
    in a constant state of war as truth is sacrificed on the altar of bellicosity, 
    nationalism, greed, hypocrisy and selfish ambition. If this is left unchecked, 
    those who seek to resurrect that long moribund world of peace and justice 
    will soon become lone voices in the wilderness, eventually being heard no 
    more. And by the time the people of the United States realize how myopic they 
    were to have placed their democracy, their freedoms, their trust and their 
    lives into the hands of deceitful and evil people, the pendulum will have 
    ceased swinging.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

  <p><b>Reading the newspapers anymore is eerily reminiscent of all those bad 
    novels warning of the advent of fascism in America. &quot;It Can't Happen 
    Here&quot; by Sinclair Lewis was a bad book, and the genre shades off into 
    right-wing paranoia about black helicopters, including the memorably awful 
    &quot;Turner Diaries.&quot; I don't use the f-word myself--in fact, for years, 
    I've made fun of liberals who hear the approach of jackbooted fascism around 
    every corner. But to quote a real authority on the subject, &quot;Fascism 
    should more properly be called corporatism, since it is the merger of state 
    and corporate power&quot;--Benito Mussolini.</b></p>
  <p><b> Paul Krugman recently quoted the quite apolitical Web site Corporate 
    Governance, which matter-of-factly remarks,&quot;Given the power of corporate 
    lobbyists, government control often equates to de facto corporate control 
    anyway.&quot; It's getting downright creepy out there.</b></p>
  <p><b>The most hair raising news de jour is about Total Information Awareness, 
    a giant government computer spy system being set up to spy on Americans and 
    run by none other than John Poindexter of Iran-Contra fame. Total Information 
    Awareness will provide intelligence agencies and law enforcement with instant 
    access to information from e-mail, telephone records, credit cards, banking 
    transactions and travel records, all without a search warrant. It will, said 
    Poindexter, &quot;break down the stovepipes&quot; that separate commercial 
    and government databases. The just-passed Homeland Security Bill undermines 
    the Privacy Act of 1974, which was intended to limit what government agencies 
    can do with personal information...</b></p>
  <p><b>The great writer on the subject of totalitarianism was George Orwell, 
    and &quot;1984&quot; is always worth rereading. Damned if GeeDubya Bush didn't 
    pop up the other day to announce that we must fight a war &quot;for the sake 
    of peace.&quot; That's not vaguely Orwellian, it's a direct steal...</b></p>

  <p><b>In a move aimed at averting attacks like those on Sept.11, Attorney General

<p align="center"><b>UNLEASHING THE FBI</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>by Nat Hentoff</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>As usual, television-broadcast and cable-got it wrong. The thrust of what 
    they call reporting on the reorganization of the FBI focused on the 900 or 
    so new agents, the primacy of intelligence gathering over law enforcement, 
    and the presence of CIA supervisors within the bosom of the FBI. (It used 
    to be illegal for the CIA to spy on Americans within our borders).</b></p>
  <p><b>But the poisonous core of this reorganization is its return to the time 
    of J. Edgar Hoover and COINTELPRO, the counter-intelligence operation--perversively 
    active from 1956 to 1971--that so disgraced the Bureau that it was forced 
    to adopt new guidelines to prevent such wholesale subversion of the Bill of 
    Rights ever again. Under COINTELPRO, the FBI monitored, infiltrated, manipulated, 
    and secretly fomented diversions within civil rights, anti-war, black, and 
    other entirely lawful organizations who were using the First Amendment to 
    disagree with government policies...</b></p>
  <p><b>In 1975, Frank Church of Idaho told the nation...that COINTELPRO had been 
    &quot;a sophisticated vigilante operation aimed squarely at preventing the 
    exercise of First Amendment rights of speech and association.&quot; And Church 
    pledged: &quot;The American people need to be reassured that never again will 
    an agency of the government be permitted to conduct a secret war against those 
    citizens it considers a threat to the established order.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>From now on, covert FBI agents can mingle with unsuspecting Americans 
    at churches, mosques, synagogues, meetings of environmentalists, the ACLU, 
    the Gun Owners of America, and Reverend Al Sharpton's presidential campaign 
    headquarters...</b></p>
  <p><b>Back in 1975, Frank Church issued a warning that is far more pertinent 
    now than it was then. He was speaking of how the government's intelligence 
    capabilities aimed at &quot;potential&quot; enemies as well as disloyal Americans--could 
    at any time be turned around on the American people, and no American would 
    have any privacy left--such is the capacity to monitor everything, telephone

  <p><b>When America is at war, according to Chief Justice William Rehnquist,

    means, of course, that they didn't have any to begin with)</font><b>. There

  <p><b>With all the talk of war today...it may sound as if the chief justice

<p align="center"><b>THE POLITICS OF THE INQUISITOR</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>by Peter Brooks.</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>NEW HAVEN__Though George W. Bush admits he is not an avid reader, his 
    wife is a serious lover of literature. Laura Bush has read widely, from Greek 
    tragedy to William Faulkner to Truman Capote. When asked to name her favorite 
    book, on the long list she has read, she selected <i>The Grand Inquisitor 
    </i>section of Dostoyevsky's <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. This is an interesting 
    and suggestive choice, of a chilling and troubling chapter in a challenging 
    novel.</b></p>
  <p><b>Of course Mrs. Bush's choice of reading has nothing to do with Republican 
    philosophy. But since her husband is the party's nominee for president, one 
    might speculate about the messages the Republicans could find in this literary 
    work.</b></p>
  <p><b>The Grand Inquisitor is actually a story told by Ivan Karamazov to his 
    brother Alyosha, in which Ivan imagines the return of Jesus to earth...at 
    the height of the Spanish Inquisition. Jesus is taken prisoner by the Grand 
    Inquisitor who then--like police interrogators before and since--details the 
    suspect's crimes. The return of Jesus after centuries of absence from the 
    world interferes with the work of the church. Jesus preached a message of 
    freedom, but the church has discovered that it is not freedom that humankind 
    desires; it is authority.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Oh we shall convince them that they will only become free when they 
    resign their freedom to us, and submit to us,: says the Inquisitor. &quot;The 
    most tormenting secrets of their conscience--all, all they will bring to us, 
    and we will decide all things, and they will joyfully believe our decision, 
    because it will deliver them from their great care and their present terrible 
    torments of personal and free decision.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>As for Jesus, he has no place in a well-regulated society. He is a trouble-maker, 
    a scandal: &quot;For if anyone has ever deserved our stake, it is you. Tomorrow 
    I shall burn you.&quot; He is sent to the auto-da-fe.</b></p>
  <p><b>Dostoyevsky's creation of 1880 is hauntingly predictive of the inquisitors 
    of the 20th century who all, from whatever political faith and ideological 
    position, claim their authority to dispose of human freedom in the name of 
    authority. Only the inquisitors know what humanity really wants and needs.

  <p><b>It's the kind of initiative one would have expected to see in Nazi Germany, 
    Soviet Russia or when Afghanistan was run by the Taliban. A 'Citizen Corps' 
    with a projected ten million members, given power by a centralised government 
    to spy on friends, neighbours, colleagues and even people who attend the same 
    church. Feel a bit suspicious about the guy sitting next to you at work who 
    doesn't stand up for the national anthem? Ring the Hotline. Do you feel that 
    the pastor at your church isn't 100 per cent behind the government during 
    his sermons? Ring the Hotline. Is your neighbour critical of the police? Well, 
    you know what to do. </b></p>
  <p><b>This initiative is taking place in America, which has seen the gradual 
    erosion of civil liberties in the wake of September 11 become a deluge this 
    week with the launch of the Citizen Corps and Operation Tips projects, or 
    Operation Citizen Snitch as its critics are calling it. The latest in a long 
    line of draconian measures to take place in America since John Ashcroft's 
    appointment as Attorney General, both the Citizen Corps and Operation Tips 
    have startled many civil libertarians who feel that the Bush administration's 
    determination to oust Saddam Hussein has had the added -- and not unexpected 
    -- bonus of deflecting public attention from some of their more severe domestic 
    plans.</b></p>
  <p><b> Both the Citizen Corps and Operation Tips (Terrorism Information and 
    Prevention Service) are administered by the Department of Justice and, according 
    to official documentation, &quot;several other federal agencies&quot;, although 
    it fails to mention that there are also provisions for the army to partake 
    in police activities -- something unheard of in modern America. </b></p>
  <p><b>According to their publicity material, &quot;the programme will involve 
    the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are 
    in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in 
    public places&quot;. Effectively, this has deputised the nation, but apart 
    from becoming a cranks' charter in the work place, the real thrust of Operation 
    Tips is to enable postal workers, repair men and other people who have routine 
    access to private houses to report anything suspicious. Anything at all. &quot;These 
    workers will use their common sense and knowledge of their environment to 
    identify suspicious or unusual activity,&quot; goes the blurb. Effectively, 
    if a repair man arrives to fix your fridge, and happens to notice a copy of 
    Michael Moore's book, Stupid White Men, on your counter, he would be within 
    his remit to call the Hotline and you could, depending on how busy the local 
    FBI field office is, find yourself receiving a visit from the federales. </b></p>
  <p><b>It all sounds so absurd that most Americans are inclined to view such 
    fears as an example of civil libertarianism gone bad. The only problem is 
    that such events have already been going on for last ten months or so. Earlier 
    this year, police in San Diego broke up a meeting held by the aforementioned 
    Moore to discuss the refusal of local venues to give him a venue to launch 
    his book. As one observer at the time commented, &quot;they didn't use force, 
    but they had their clubs and pepper spray out and made it quite clear that 
    they were prepared to use them&quot;.</b></p>
  <p><b> While it's clear that America has enough Constitutional checks and balances 
    to make sure it can't turn into a police state overnight, there is a growing 
    mood of alarm that Bush and his inner circle are happy to try. And along the 
    way, if they manage to drag America closer to a theocracy than ever before, 
    fundamentalist Christian John Ashcroft won't be complaining. </b></p>
  <p><b>As the White House gears itself up for an attack on Iraq, in complete 
    contravention of international law and against the advice of the now marginalised 
    Colin Powell, even some of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the people in charge 
    of the Pentagon have expressed surprise at the White House's belligerent attitude. 
    <br>
    &quot;I've never seen a civilian politician with such guts for war,&quot; 
    one of the JCoS told the press, and the strangely public way the White House 
    is going about their preparations for any attack are seen by some American 
    commentators as little more than an example of political sleight of hand that 
    could have come straight from the last president.&quot; Bill Clinton was a 
    master of the political con trick. His major foreign military forays invariably 
    coincided with some domestic problem. For instance, his bombing of Iraq in 
    1998 started just days before his impeachment was about to begin -- the impeachment 
    was delayed. <br>
    As Americans focus on ousting the Iraqi leader, Bush has been giving a series 
    of Homeland speeches where he has been warning that the &quot;war will be 
    fought on two fronts, against the enemy without and the enemy within&quot;. 
    It's surprisingly similar to one speech given by his father who, on launching 
    Operation Desert Storm more than a decade ago, warned of an internal enemy 
    &quot;weakening our country.&quot; At that time it was drug users, now it 
    is the threat of terrorism. </b></p>
  <p><b>At this point in time it is believed that more than 1,000 Arab Americans 
    are being held somewhere in detention. The reason the figure is not exact 
    is because the authorities don't have to release any information, don't have 
    to charge those being held and can continue doing so with impunity. Using 
    legislation last used against German spies in World War II, these people could 
    even be executed without notification. As Rumsfeld steels himself for war 
    abroad, Ashcroft is the domestic general, seeing not Reds but Browns under 
    his bed. He has even been privately keen to discuss the possibility of interning 
    Arab Americans, something America hasn't done since it shamefully interned 
    nearly 100,000 American men, women and children of Japanese extraction during 
    the second world war -- something most Americans are prepared to accept was 
    an outrage. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>A good example of where John Ashcroft is coming from, was his appointment 
    of Peter Kirsanow to the US Civil Rights Commission, an oxymoronic title for 
    the organisation following Kirsanow's recent statement that internment camps 
    could be set up if there is another attack, &quot;and if they (those responsible 
    for any second attack) come from the same ethnic group as those who attacked 
    the World Trade Center, you can forget about human rights&quot;. But perhaps 
    the most bizarre twist of all came when Dave Lindorf, a journalist for web-based 
    magazine, salon.com, signed up for Operation Tips and when he phoned the Hotline 
    to provide some bogus information. He was passed through to the production 
    offices of a television programme. He writes, &quot;instead of getting a hardened 
    G-person when I called, a mellifluous receptionist's voice answered, &quot;America's 
    Most Wanted&quot;. A little flummoxed, I said I was expecting to reach the 
    FBI. &quot;Aren't you familiar with the TV programme 'America's Most Wanted'?&quot; 
    she asked patiently. &quot;We've been asked to take the FBI's Tips calls for 
    them'.&quot; <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>So now, when those Americans who don't act American enough find themselves 
    answering the door to the FBI some dark night, they could also find themselves 
    being filmed by a crime-based reality programme.</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

    <b>Time to Call for His Resignation<br>
    September 4 - 10, 2002<br>
    <br>
    Jonathan Turley is a professor of constitutional and public-interest law at 
    George Washington University Law School in D.C. He is also a defense attorney 
    in national security cases and other matters, writes for a number of publications, 
    and is often on television. He and I occasionally exchange leads on civil 
    liberties stories, but I learn much more from him than he does from me. For 
    example, a Jonathan Turley column in the national edition of the August 14 
    Los Angeles Times (&quot;Camps for Citizens: Ashcroft's Hellish Vision&quot;) 
    begins: </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Attorney General John Ashcroft's announced desire for camps for 
    U.S. citizens he deems to be 'enemy combatants' has moved him from merely 
    being a political embarrassment to being a constitutional menace.&quot; Actually, 
    ever since General Ashcroft pushed the U.S. Patriot Act through an overwhelmingly 
    supine Congress soon after September 11, he has subverted more elements of 
    the Bill of Rights than any attorney general in American history. </b></p>
  <p><b>Under the Justice Department's new definition of &quot;enemy combatant&quot;&#151;which 
    won the enthusiastic approval of the president and Defense Secretary Donald 
    Rumsfeld&#151;anyone defined as an &quot;enemy combatant,&quot; very much 
    including American citizens, can be held indefinitely by the government, without 
    charges, a hearing, or a lawyer. In short, incommunicado. </b></p>
  <p><b>Two American citizens&#151;Yaser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla&#151;are 
    currently locked up in military brigs as &quot;enemy combatants.&quot; (Hamdi 
    is in solitary in a windowless room.) As Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Tribe 
    said on ABC's Nightline (August 12): &quot;It bothers me that the executive 
    branch is taking the amazing position that just on the president's say-so, 
    any American citizen can be picked up, not just in Afghanistan, but at O'Hare 
    Airport or on the streets of any city in this country, and locked up without 
    access to a lawyer or court just because the government says he's connected 
    somehow with the Taliban or Al Qaeda. That's not the American way. It's not 
    the constitutional way. . . . And no court can even figure out whether we've 
    got the wrong guy.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>In Hamdi's case, the government claims it can hold him for interrogation 
    in a floating navy brig off Norfolk, Virginia, as long as it needs to. When 
    Federal District Judge Robert Doumar asked the man from the Justice Department 
    how long Hamdi is going to be locked up without charges, the government lawyer 
    said he couldn't answer that question. The Bush administration claims the 
    judiciary has no right to even interfere. </b></p>
  <p><b>Now more Americans are also going to be dispossessed of every fundamental 
    legal right in our system of justice and put into camps. Jonathan Turley reports 
    that Justice Department aides to General Ashcroft &quot;have indicated that 
    A 'HIGH-LEVEL COMMITTEE' WILL RECOMMEND WHICH CITIZENS ARE TO BE STRIPPED 
    OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND SENT TO ASHCROFT'S NEW CAMPS.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>It should be noted that Turley, who tries hard to respect due process, 
    even in unpalatable situations, publicly defended Ashcroft during the latter's 
    turbulent nomination battle, which is more than I did. Again, in his Los Angeles 
    Times column, Turley tries to be fair: &quot;Of course Ashcroft is not considering 
    camps on the order of the internment camps used to incarcerate Japanese American 
    citizens in World War II. But he can be credited only with thinking smaller; 
    we have learned from painful experience that unchecked authority, once tasted, 
    easily becomes insatiable.&quot; (Emphasis added.) </b></p>
  <p><b>Turley insists that &quot;the proposed camp plan should trigger immediate 
    Congressional hearings and reconsideration of Ashcroft's fitness for important 
    office. Whereas Al Qaeda is a threat to the lives of our citizens, Ashcroft 
    has become a clear and present threat to our liberties.&quot; (Emphasis added.) 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>On August 8, The Wall Street Journal, which much admires Ashcroft on its 
    editorial pages, reported that &quot;the Goose Creek, South Carolina, facility 
    that houses [Jose] Padilla&#151;mostly empty since it was designated in January 
    to hold foreigners captured in the U.S. and facing military tribunals&#151;now 
    has a special wing that could be used to jail about 20 U.S. citizens if the 
    government were to deem them enemy combatants, a senior administration official 
    said.&quot; The Justice Department has told Turley that it has not denied 
    this story. And space can be found in military installations for more &quot;enemy 
    combatants.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>But once the camps are operating, can General Ashcroft be restrained from 
    detaining&#151;not in these special camps, but in regular lockups&#151;any 
    American investigated under suspicion of domestic terrorism under the new, 
    elastic FBI guidelines for criminal investigations? From page three of these 
    Ashcroft terrorism FBI guidelines: &quot;The nature of the conduct engaged 
    in by a [terrorist] enterprise will justify an inference that the standard 
    [for opening a criminal justice investigation] is satisfied, even if there 
    are no known statements by participants that advocate or indicate planning 
    for violence or other prohibited acts.&quot; (Emphasis added.) That conduct 
    can be simply &quot;intimidating&quot; the government, according to the USA 
    Patriot Act. The new Steven Spielberg-Tom Cruise movie, Minority Report, shows 
    the government, some years hence, imprisoning &quot;pre-criminals&quot; before 
    they engage in, or even think of, terrorism. That may not be just fiction, 
    folks. </b></p>
  <p><b>Returning to General Ashcroft's plans for American enemy combatants, an 
    August 8 New York Times editorial&#151;written before those plans were revealed&#151;said: 
    &quot;The Bush administration seems to believe, on no good legal authority, 
    that if it calls citizens combatants in the war on terrorism, it can imprison 
    them indefinitely and deprive them of lawyers. This defiance of the courts 
    repudiates two centuries of constitutional law and undermines the very freedoms 
    that President Bush says he is defending in the struggle against terrorism.&quot; 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Meanwhile, as the camps are being prepared, the braying Terry McAuliffe 
    and the pack of Democratic presidential aspirants are campaigning on corporate 
    crime, with no reference to the constitutional crimes being committed by Bush 
    and Ashcroft. As Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis prophesied: &quot;The 
    greatest menace to freedom is an inert people.&quot; And an inert Democratic 
    leadership. See you in a month, if I'm not an Ashcroft camper. </b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Fourth activist in D.M. ordered to testify<br>
  The federal probe also focuses on a November antiwar forum held at Drake University.<br>
  By JEFF ECKHOFF and MARK SEIBERT</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>02/06/2004</b></p>
  <p><b>A federal investigation expanded Thursday as prosecutors subpoenaed a 
    fourth peace activist to appear before a grand jury and secured a court order 
    forbidding Drake University officials to discuss a demand for information 
    about a November antiwar conference on campus.</b></p>
  <p><b>Federal authorities so far have refused to disclose what the investigation 
    is about or what laws might have been broken. But an officer with the FBI's 
    Joint Terrorism Task Force served a subpoena to Wendy Vasquez of Des Moines 
    on Thursday morning. Vasquez, an antiwar activist who visited Iraq in 2002, 
    was surprised. </b><b>&quot;Just the whole idea that somebody would think 
    I'm a terrorist is ludicrous,&quot; she said.</b></p>
  <p><b>Vasquez's summons was the latest grand jury subpoena issued as part of 
    a federal investigation that includes three other antiwar activists, as well 
    as records of an activist legal group at Drake. Vasquez was among dozens of 
    activists who attended a Nov. 15 conference at Drake called &quot;Stop the 
    Occupation! Bring the Iowa Guard Home!&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>The conference was hosted by the Drake Chapter of the National Lawyers 
    Guild. The event was followed the next day by a demonstration at the Iowa 
    National Guard Headquarters in Johnston where 12 protesters were arrested. 
    On Wednesday, federal investigators subpoenaed three activists involved that 
    weekend. Elton Davis, Patti McKee and Brian Terrell have been ordered to appear 
    in Des Moines before a federal grand jury on Tuesday.</b></p>
  <p><b>Davis and Vasquez were arrested at the Nov. 16 demonstration, which Terrell 
    also attended. McKee, who could not be reached for comment, is listed as an 
    organizer of the conference. Federal prosecutors have refused to discuss the 
    investigation or the purpose of the grand jury. </b><b>But Thursday morning, 
    at the request of the U.S. attorney's office in Des Moines, U.S. District 
    Judge Ronald Longstaff issued an order under seal - meaning its contents are 
    secret.</b></p>
  <p><b>Sources say the order prohibits Drake employees from commenting about 
    a separate subpoena demanding university records. The Drake subpoena asks 
    for all records relating to the Nov. 15 conference. It also demands information 
    about leaders of the National Lawyers Guild, location of the guild's offices 
    and any annual reports since 2002. </b><b>Part of the subpoena asks for &quot;all 
    records of Drake University campus security reflecting any observations made 
    of the November 15, 2003, meeting, including any records of persons in charge 
    or control of the meeting, and any records of attendees of the meeting.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>The National Lawyers Guild is a New York-based organization that regularly 
    involves itself in social activism and the defense of protesters. A guild 
    official vowed that the group will fight the subpoena &quot;with everything 
    that we have...</b><b>It's a clear First Amendment violation and a clear attempt 
    to intimidate lawful expression,&quot; said Heidi Boghosian, the guild's executive 
    director. &quot;We have no intention of turning anything over.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Vanderschel said Thursday that he could 
    &quot;neither confirm nor deny the existence of any ongoing investigation...</b><b>I'm 
    not able to provide any further comments,&quot; he said. </b><b>Drake officials 
    also declined to comment when asked about the existence of a gag order.</b></p>
  <p><b>Terrell, one of the activists who has been subpoenaed, was skeptical about 
    the effort to silence Drake employees. &quot;What they're doing is they're 
    claiming it's to protect the privacy of students,&quot; he said. </b></p>

    Here It Comes: 'Brain Fingerprinting - A New Paragrim'<br>
    From Focus On Freedom<br>
    Counterterrorism Applications<br>
    Barin Fingerprinting Laboratories, Inc<br>
    2-21-4</b></p>
  <p><b>(Note - Read this very carefully and 'imagine the possibilities...' We 
    are now at the doorstep of 'thought crime' and facing possible conviction 
    and prison for simply having READ something that those in control do not approve 
    of. -ed)</b></p>
  <p><b>There is a new technology, that for the first time, allows us to measure 
    scientifically if specific information is stored in a person's brain. Brain 
    Fingerprinting&reg; technology determines the presence or absence of specific 
    information, such as terrorist training and associations. This exciting new 
    technology can address the following critical elements in the fight against 
    terrorism: * Aid in determining who has participated in terrorist acts, directly 
    or indirectly. * Aid in identifying trained terrorists with the potential 
    to commit future terrorist acts, even if they are in a &quot;sleeper&quot; 
    cell and have not been active for years. * Help to identify people who have 
    knowledge or training in banking, finance or communications and who are associated 
    with terrorist teams and acts. * Help to determine if an individual is in 
    a leadership role within a terrorist organization. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>One fundamental difference between a terrorist and an innocent suspect 
    is that the terrorist has detailed knowledge of terrorist activities and an 
    innocent person does not. A terrorist has either committed a crime, received 
    training in terrorism or worked with others in planning terrorist attacks. 
    The innocent suspect does not have this type of information stored in his 
    brain. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Brain Fingerprinting technology is based on the principle that the brain 
    is central to all human acts. In a terrorist act, there may or may not be 
    peripheral evidence such as fingerprints or DNA, but the brain of the perpetrator 
    is always there, planning, executing, and recording the crime. The terrorist 
    has knowledge of organizations, training and plans that an innocent person 
    does not have. Until the invention of Brain Fingerprinting testing, there 
    was no scientific way to detect this fundamental difference. Brain Fingerprinting 
    testing provides an accurate, economical and timely solution to the central 
    problem in the fight against terrorism. It is now possible to determine scientifically 
    whether or not a person has terrorist training and knowledge of terrorist 
    activities. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Brain Fingerprinting testing can determine quickly and accurately whether 
    or not specific knowledge is present or absent in an individual. In a Brain 
    Fingerprinting test, words, pictures or sounds relevant to a crime, terrorist 
    act or terrorist training are presented by a computer, along with other irrelevant 
    images and sounds. Electrical brain responses are measured non-invasively 
    through a patented headband equipped with sensors. A computer then analyzes 
    the brain responses and determines whether or not the specific information 
    is stored in the brain of the suspect. The results are not affected by the 
    willingness of the person being tested to tell the truth. By testing for specific 
    information, Brain Fingerprinting technology can accurately distinguish between 
    a trained terrorist and an innocent person who may have knowledge of certain 
    locations, people and events for legitimate reasons. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Brain Fingerprinting testing detects whether or not specific information 
    is stored in a person's brain, not truth or falsehood. In fact, no questions 
    are asked and no answers are given during a Brain Fingerprinting test. Brain 
    Fingerprinting testing cannot be used for general, non-specific testing, something 
    for which no reliable facts exist against which to compare the subject's answer. 
    For example, a general question like &quot;Are you a terrorist?&quot; is not 
    something that can be addressed by Brain Fingerprinting technology. However, 
    the recognition of specific information from terrorist training or of individuals 
    at a training camp can be detected. Investigators must have reliable, factual 
    details from which to draw the information that will be used to structure 
    the Brain Fingerprinting test. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Any known legitimate means through which a subject may have encountered 
    crime or terrorist-relevant information are examined prior to conducting a 
    Brain Fingerprinting test. Standard protocols ensure that the individual has 
    a chance to reveal any circumstances through which he may have had legitimate 
    access to the crime-relevant information in question. Any information the 
    suspect has obtained through legitimate means is eliminated from consideration 
    before the test is administered. A suspect is tested only on information that 
    he has no legitimate means of knowing, information he denies knowledge of, 
    and for which he has no legitimate explanation if it turns out that the information 
    is indeed stored in his brain. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>With the Brain Fingerprinting system, a significant scientific breakthrough 
    has now become a practical applied technology. A new era in security and intelligence 
    gathering has begun. Now, terrorists and those supporting terrorism can be 
    identified quickly and accurately. No longer should any terrorist be able 
    to evade justice for lack of evidence. And there is no reason why an innocent 
    individual should be falsely imprisoned or convicted of terrorist activity. 
    A Brain Fingerprinting test can determine with an extremely high degree of 
    accuracy those who are involved with terrorist activity and those who are 
    not. <br>

  <p><b>Comment<br>
    From Ted Twietmeyer tedtw@frontiernet.net <br>
    2-22-4 </b></p>
  <p><b>Hi Jeff - As you know, I have a long and &quot;colorful&quot; history 
    in electronics. I now work where the brain/vision connection are studied. 
    Although not as expert in this as the scientists I work with are, I can shed 
    some light on what this is about and how it really works. And right now, the 
    research has barely scratched the surface of the complexities of the brain 
    and its functioning. What brain fingerprinting is attempting to do, is to 
    use something long known to scientists called &quot;evoked response.&quot; 
    A stimulus is presented to a test subject, often using a computer monitor 
    for the visual stimulation. And ElectroEncephloGraph (EEG) is used to record 
    the results. Experiments takes place in a SHIELDED room with a heavy door, 
    which also keeps sound out. This improves the accuracy of tests, and the additional 
    shielding is required for making some types of measurements. Signals from 
    a special fabric head cap with more than 20 electrodes, are connected via 
    shielded cables to the EEG machine outside that records the brainwaves syncronized 
    with the visual stimulation. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The key thing here, is that testing requires VOLUNTARY participation by 
    the subject. The question I share with many of your readers, is &quot;How 
    will you force someone, perhaps standing at a security station in a noisy 
    airport or in an interrogation room, to stare at a computer monitor ? The 
    idea in the real world is an impractical one. If the subject does not watch 
    the screen, then nothing useful happens. As america seems to be plummeting 
    headlong into a long-planned police state, we now see companies popping up 
    attempting to take laboratory experiments into mainstream public applications. 
    And of course, its not about security at all, its just about MONEY. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>It will be up to the american citizen to stop this madness. McCarthy would 
    be proud, and would have loved to have the toys we have today to spy on people. 
    The checks and balances our founding fathers set up in government are under 
    attack right now. This isn't a problem facing a future generation, its OUR 
    problem. RIGHT NOW. Speak up and be a thorn in the side of those in power- 
    let them know you don't want endless tracking, tracing and interrogations. 
    People often think its &quot;someone else's problem.&quot; Its a great way 
    to lie to themselves to ignore it all. <br>

    House Bill Would Enforce Patriot Act Secrecy Clause <br>
    by Jessica Azulay (bio) <br>
  </p>
  <p>Jun 22 - Even as the government increasingly comes under fire from civil 
    libertarians for using Patriot Act provisions to seek personal information 
    without probable cause, some lawmakers are working to expand those powers. 
  </p>
  <p>In recent months, signs of public outrage have begun to surface over the 
    FBI's use of National Security Letters (NSLs) to secretly demand information 
    from business and public agencies about their clientele. Under one of the 
    most controversial section of the USA PATRIOT Act, third party record holders 
    who receive NSLs requesting information about their patrons are forbidden 
    from telling anyone about the Letter. Now some lawmakers in the US House of 
    Representatives are considering a bill that would designate concrete penalties 
    for people who refuse to comply with NSL requests for information or who tell 
    anyone that federal agents requested personal information about their clients.</p>
  <p><br>
    Additionally, the bill would grant the FBI greater power to secretly monitor 
    non-citizens and would allow the use of secretly gathered evidence in immigration 
    hearing without giving defendants the opportunity to legally challenge the 
    information. The Anti-Terrorism Intelligence Tools Improvement Act of 2003 
    (HR 3179) was introduced in the House last September and is currently in the 
    House Judiciary Committee. The bill's opponents fear that one of the bill's 
    sponsors, Representative Porter Goss (R-FL), who also chairs the House Intelligence 
    Committee will fold the provisions of HR 3179 into the annual intelligence 
    authorization bill, making it difficult for lawmakers to oppose.</p>
  <p>The legislation calls for a one-year maximum jail sentence for anyone who 
    knowingly violates the nondisclosure provision of the USA PATRIOT Act. Anyone 
    who violates the rule &quot;with the intent to obstruct an investigation or 
    judicial proceeding&quot; would get a maximum sentence of five years under 
    the legislation. The bill also gives law enforcement the ability to enlist 
    the judicial system's help in forcing people to comply with the National Security 
    Letter information requests.</p>
  <p>&quot;There is no reason for this legislation,&quot; Chip Pitts, head of 
    the Bill of Rights Defense Committee of Dallas and a former constitutional 
    law professor told Wired News. &quot;Given the expanse of powers and secrecy 
    already granted in the Patriot Act, and given the unclear security benefits 
    and possible security detriments of that legislation, why do we need a further 
    amendment of the law to grant more powers to the government?&quot; But proponents 
    of the bill do see a need for the provisions of the HR 3179 because without 
    it, they say, the nondisclosure provision on the Patriot Act lacks teeth.</p>
  <p>&quot;Right now you can't disclose if you receive a National Security Letter,&quot; 
    spokesperson for the House Judiciary Committee Jeff Lungren told Wired News. 
    &quot;But if you do disclose it, there is no penalty for that. There's [also] 
    no stick to deal with a person that refuses to comply with a national security 
    letter.&quot; Wired reports that proponents of the legislation accuse civil 
    libertarians of overreacting to the legislation. They say the purpose of the 
    bill is to &quot;plug a few gaps&quot; in the Patriot Act by providing for 
    clear penalties in areas that were left ambiguous.</p>
  <p>But to Jim Dempsey, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), 
    those gaps are important because they give companies a limited ability to 
    negotiate with authorities. Dempsey told Wired that if federal agents make 
    a request that a company finds too broad, they can sometimes resist and force 
    the FBI to narrow their search. Dempsey's group, a non-profit public policy 
    organization that advocates democracy and civil liberties &quot;in the digital 
    age,&quot; has been closely watching HR 3179 and is encouraging people to 
    contact their congressional representatives about the legislation.</p>
  <p>Civil liberties advocates argue that the gag rule silences members of the 
    public from challenging the legitimacy of government requests for private 
    information. They further accuse the government, under cover of the secrecy 
    clause, of using the Letters to bypass probable cause requirements and obtain 
    information about crimes unrelated to terrorism investigations. By imposing 
    jail terms on people who fail to comply with National Security Letters, even 
    when noncompliance comes from legitimate concerns over violation of privacy 
    or government abuse of authority, civil libertarians say HR 3179 would further 
    concentrate power in the hands of government agents and narrow avenues of 
    recourse that exist.</p>
  <p>The proposed legislation would also further amend the Foreign Intelligence 
    Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), which governs the procedures federal agents 
    must follow when seeking judicial permission to electronically monitor or 
    physically search people suspected of engaging in espionage or international 
    terrorism on behalf of a foreign power. </p>
  <p>The Patriot Act changed some provisions of FISA to give federal agents greater 
    domestic surveillance powers, and the use of FISA warrants to investigate 
    suspected terrorists in the United States has worried many civil rights groups. 
    They say the expansions under the Patriot Act allow federal agents to spy 
    on people's free speech and political activities without having to show probable 
    cause. </p>
  <p>HR 3179 would expand the FISA definition of &quot;agent of a foreign power&quot; 
    to include one who &quot;engages in international terrorism or activities 
    in preparation therefor,&quot; but who does not necessarily work with a foreign 
    government for terrorist organization.</p>
  <p>&quot;Because there is no accepted definition of international terrorism, 
    and because they're eliminating the need for someone to be acting on behalf 
    of a foreign government, you're relying on subjective and perhaps arbitrary 
    or politically motivated definitions&quot; when determining who can be investigated 
    under FISA provisions, Pitts told Wired. </p>
  <p>In a letter addressed to the House Judiciary Committee, a coalition of almost 
    80 organizations, expressed their concerns with HR 3179 &quot;Congress originally 
    approved the FISA with the explicit requirement that it would only be used 
    against individuals acting on behalf of foreign governments or groups,&quot; 
    the letter reads. &quot;This connection to a foreign power is essential to 
    the constitutionality of FISA, which contains lower probable cause standards 
    than are required in criminal cases.&quot; A final provision of HR 3179 would 
    allow for the use of evidence gathered with FISA warrants to be used in immigration 
    cases without providing notice and an opportunity for the accused to challenge 
    the evidence as is currently mandated under FISA. In a letter to Congress 
    urging members to oppose the Act, the ACLU says this portion of the bill would 
    eliminate &quot;important judicial safeguards&quot; currently in place to 
    assure that evidence used against immigrants in court was obtained legally. 
  </p>
  <p>At a May 18, 2004 hearing about the proposed legislation, Thomas J. Harrington, 
    the deputy assistant director of the counterterrorism division of the FBI, 
    defended HR 3179. &quot;It contains advantageous reforms which the FBI believes 
    are necessary to assist us in gathering the intelligence that will prevent 
    future terrorist attacks,&quot; Harrington told the Judiciary Committee. Nevertheless, 
    a broad range of civil liberties groups -- including progressives and conservatives 
    -- hold deep misgivings about granting the government increased investigative 
    and prosecutorial powers. They complain that even while provisions of the 
    Patriot Act are being debated, lawmakers are attempting to secretly pass legislation 
    that further erodes the liberties of US citizens and residents.</p>
  <p>According to Wired and The American Spectator, HR 3179 is just one of several 
    pieces of legislation concerning the government's powers to obtain information 
    about citizens and residents of the US being slipped through Congress without 
    proper debate. The Spectator reports that it was only after massive opposition 
    from civil libertarians that the House Judiciary Committee agreed to hold 
    a hearing on the Anti-Terrorism Intelligence Tools Improvement Act. </p>
  <p>Even after the hearing, the Center for Democracy and Technology worries that 
    Rep. Goss will attempt to bypass House debate on the measure by attaching 
    it to the annual intelligence authorization bill, which according to the CDT, 
    is debated &quot;behind closed doors.&quot; In an action alert about HR 3179, 
    the CDT says that, since the intelligence authorization bill contains provisions 
    seen as important by lawmakers, it is very difficult for House members to 
    vote against the bill, even when it contains provisions they oppose. </p>
  <p>According to Wired, HR 3179 is just one of six bills derived from Justice 
    Department draft legislation known as Patriot II. When the details of Patriot 
    II were leaked to the press, the Justice Department was forced to shelve the 
    proposal due to massive public outcry. Nevertheless, provisions of the Patriot 
    II proposal have been showing up in Congress either as individual bills or 
    attached to other bills as amendments and riders. In fact, the Spectator reports 
    that last year, one of those measures was passed with little debate after 
    the House Intelligence Committee attached it to the annual intelligence authorization 
    bill. </p>
  <p>&quot;Any expansion of the PATRIOT Act is premature at this point,&quot; 
    wrote the CDT. &quot;Congress has not finished its oversight work to determine 
    how the new powers in the PATRIOT Act have been used and whether they were 
    needed to begin with.&quot; The CDT argues that before making further changes 
    to surveillance laws, Congress &quot;should include oversight mechanisms and 
    judicial checks and balances.&quot; </p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>My dearest, bravest grandaughter. You will remember when you went into 
    the military services that I told you the day would be coming soon in America 
    when dissent (not only political but spiritual dissent) would not be tolerated 
    by many of the &quot;patriotic kind&quot; in this country. I told you that 
    if you were still in the military when these things began to happen that you 
    would have to assist in rounding up and arresting people like me who have 
    a long history of pacifism, and who seriously and mindfully adhere to the 
    historical teachings and doctrines of Christ. (And I am not referring to the 
    &quot;religious&quot; doctrines that they imbibe upon people in the American 
    churches). Well the time is fast approaching. And even if you take a discharge 
    from the military, and go into &quot;law enforcement&quot; as I hear of you, 
    you will still be part of that great machine that has been oiled up for only 
    one purpose, and that is to do the will of the &quot;government&quot; without 
    questioning either the government's motives or your own. Why would you want 
    to be in a position of authority over other human beings? Especially with 
    a fire arm at your side, and with all the possibilities of killing others 
    that go along with it? It is a GREAT danger to your own soul. <br>
    <br>
    And so here I am again, reminding you of our conversation. Remember, the Good 
    Shepherd lays down his and her life for the sheep, he or she does not take 
    the life of others. Nor do they join forces with those that do. <br>
    <br>
    My love for you is deep. Please remember that in the crises that are unfolding... 
    Papa.</b></p>
