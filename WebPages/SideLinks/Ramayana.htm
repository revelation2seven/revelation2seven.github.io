<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b>Oh Man, I am the demon warrior Indrajit, hard to see. I 
    fight invisibly, hidden by enchantment from your sight. I attack behind the 
    wild winds of evil thought. I put out many lights left unguarded. I know you, 
    and good deeds done in life are your only shield when you must die and go 
    alone past me to another world. You may hide at night from the Sun, but never 
    from your own heart--where lives Lord Narayana (Vishnu). The entire worlds 
    are watching your deeds, and therefore forgiveness is Dharma.</b></p>

  <p align="center"><b>Valmiki the Poet looked down into the water held cupped 
    in his hand and saw into the past. Before he looked, he thought the world 
    was sweet poison. Men seemed to be living in lies, not knowing where their 
    ways went. The days seemed made of ignorance and doubt, and cast from deception 
    and illusion. But in the water he saw--a dream, a chance, and a great adventure. 
    Valmiki trusted the True and forgot the rest; he found the whole universe 
    like a bright jewel set firm in forgiving and held fast by love.</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Widen your heart. Abandon anger. Believe me, your few days 
    are numbered; make one fast choice now and no second!</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Come, clear your heart and quickly walk with me into Brahma, 
    while there is time.</b></p>

  <p align="left"><b>Rama (a manifestation of Vishnu) ruled the earth..He gave 
    a year-long festival in this very Forest...He was King, from the Center of 
    the World to the Four Ocean shores...He ruled in AYODHYA, (born of the Solar 
    Race, a descendant of the Sun).</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>On the banks of the SARAYU River is fair Ayodhya, the royal 
    capital of Kosala. She is a fabled city, famed among men. She is Twelve leagues 
    long and Ten leagues wide. (12 + 10 = 22), (12 X 10 = 120)...</b></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3b-Tree.gif" width="600" height="207"></p>
  <p align="left"><b>with Sala Trees, filled with grain and gold. Heaven is fair, 
    Ayodhya is fairer...</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Rama's Father was lord of the earth and the lord of men. 
    He was a Solar King bright as the Noonday Sun. In those bright days now gone 
    by...THE GODS FROM THE AIR saw Kosala to be clear as a mirror, with no least 
    touch of evil to make any black shadow over the land. </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Ayodhya was filled with Warriors, like a mountain cave filled 
    with lions. Her warriors were impatient and deadly to foes...They kept the 
    city safe and tried to right whatever wrongs they discovered. Dasaratha's 
    ministers were wise, able to find hidden motives AND FIGHT WITH WORDS, cautious, 
    never binding themselves to a lie, acting by their word, and sending out spies 
    to report what took place in all the world.</b></p>
  <p align="center">__________</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Brahma said (of Valmiki), &quot;So, by a River, the world's 
    first verse has been born from pity, and love and compassion for a tiny bird 
    has made you a poet. (The bird was shot by a hunter out of a Tree, and killed 
    from its mate). Use your discovery to tell Rama's story, and your verses will 
    defeat Time. As you make your poem Rama's life will be revealed to you, and 
    no words of your's will be untrue.&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Dasaratha, (Rama's father), was old and had no son to inherit 
    his kingdom...He told the priest Vasishtha. He also told his charioteer Sumantra 
    to arrange for this birth, who in turn went to the Three Queens and said, 
    &quot;We will have sons.&quot; Their countenance brightened as an Unfolding 
    Lotus.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Sumantra piled provisions for it all by the River SARAYU 
    and Vasishtha chose a day whose ruling stars were fortunate. King Dasaratha 
    watched Vasishtha liht the holy Fires by the River, and bein to sing spellbinding 
    mantras...invoking Indra, King of Heaven. &quot;Indra, King of Heaven, Come!&quot; 
    </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>In heaven above, Indra turned and hissed like a Serpent...His 
    face and chest were covered with dried blood, his robes were soiled, (Isaiah 
    63), he was angry. </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>He looked about his heaven. It was a hopeless ruin. The once 
    beautiful Heavenly Garden, NANDANA was uprooted, crushed and buried beneath 
    soot and cinders. Heaven's long golden street was littered with slain Gandharvas, 
    with Apsarasas, the dancing women of heaven, lying killed, and with the corpses 
    of Rakshasa demons. The palaces were razed to broken stones and tiles. The 
    Heavenly Stream of GANGA ran red with blood...The charred Gate of the Gods 
    lay split and wrenched from its heavenly posts.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Indra had just fought the Battle of Heaven. He had stood 
    up against THE DEMON KING RAVANA...He had fought and lost, he had been captured, 
    (and released), and now stood in heaven.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Indra went to Brahma's High heaven Beyond Change, where He 
    sat at the end of a Long Hall and through a Doorway set Three Steps beyond 
    the End of the Universe.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Indra blamed Brahma for all the evils...for creating RAVANA, 
    THE TEN-HEADED DEMON...&quot;Why do you grant boons to demons?&quot; </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Brahma asked, &quot;Where are the other gods?&quot; Agni 
    the Fire God heats stoves in Ravana's kitchens, the Rains do his washing. 
    Vayu the Wind sweeps the yards of (Lanka). Varuna, Lord of Water, supplies 
    the wines for Ravana's court. The Sun lights Ravana's halls and the Moon his 
    gardens...SO GREAT IS THE POWER OF FEAR.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;Indra, let the pains go. Where is Viswakarman the Architect 
    of Heaven?&quot; &quot;He is always by himself somewhere,&quot; said Indra. 
    &quot;Put him back to work, rebuild heaven.&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Indra replied, &quot;Ravana himself enjoys the food men sacrifice 
    to us gods, and basks in our smoke. Destroyed are the gardens in heaven that 
    once made my eyes happy and my heart sing. Now there is no song heard, and 
    I fear to go down to the sacrifice of Ayodhya King Dasaratha.&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Brahma said, &quot;Remember how to speak the Old Language 
    with me...RAVANA IS CARELESS...HE HAS LONG BEEN CARELESS...Dasaratha will 
    have Four Sons. Take the king's offerings...Stay out of Ravana's sight AND 
    BE PATIENT. Do not fight him again...Think before and not after you act.&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Indra replied, &quot;I am Indra...I am not weak like a mere 
    man...I am the Destroyer of Cities, Indra of The Thunder Hand, Lord of Paradise, 
    Lord of Lightnings! And a demon-beast overcame me...&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;Where can I find THE END , where THE BEGINNING, where 
    THE MIDDLE of all this is?&quot; Brahma said, &quot;Go to Narayana, (Vishnu). 
    Only Narayana knows, or maybe he doesn't.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Indra went to Narayana, the Lord Vishnu, the Soul of the 
    Universe. Narayana sat watching Indra approach. Indra pressed together his 
    hands, touched his brow, and bent his head low to Narayana's Feet. &quot;Searcher 
    of Hearts, I bow to you...I still have faith in the Good Law of Dharma.&quot; 
    Indra looked up past Narayana's wide chest crossed by A Neckchain of Sapphires, 
    up into the great god's joyful black eyes wide as lotus petals.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Narayana (Vishnu) in his yellow saffron Summer robes smiled 
    down at Indra. &quot;Yes, a good enough fight,&quot; said Narayana. &quot;No 
    fear, Lord of Gods.&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;How shall we bring down Ravana?&quot; asked Indra. 
    Because of Brahma's boon is the Demon King strong, and for no other cause 
    than his own. Help me, you are my only refuge, there is no other for me. I 
    will gather my Storms again and attack (Lanka), give me your permission to 
    fight Ravana once more.&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;Never!&quot; said Narayana. &quot;Don't you understand 
    that Brahma's words are always true? Do not falsify the Three Spheres of Life. 
    I would not have let you fight in the first place, though you were right to 
    resist and Ravana was wrong. Ravana asked Brahma--Let me be unslayable by 
    every creature of Heaven and of the Underworlds. (Genesis). And Brahma promised--So 
    be it. That boon is unbreakable, yet will I cause Ravana's death. That is 
    the truth. Only ask me...&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Indra, &quot;from disdain Ravana did 
    not mention men or animals, and took no safeguard against them. He eats men; 
    they are his food and why should he fear them? Lord, on Earth life resembles 
    Hell again. We need you again. Look at us, see us, and bless us. For the good 
    of all the worlds, Lord Narayana, accept birth as a man.&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;I already have.&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Waves of happiness washed over Indra. &quot;Dark blue Narayana, 
    clad in yellow, BECOME FOUR. Put aside the shall trumpet, the razor edge chakra, 
    the lotus and mace you hold in your Four Hands. Empty your Dark Hands; descend 
    into the borrowed and fanciful world of men, desparate and glittering. Become 
    Dasaratha's Four Sons born of blood and seed. Take your Goddess Lakshmi and 
    let her be your mortal wife.&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;We will go down,&quot; said Narayana.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;Lord, kill him, kill Ravana forever. I hate that proud 
    and pampered Rakasha. Favor me and curse him; give to Death his faces torn 
    apart; dry away our tears as the Sun dries morning dew.&quot; </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;I will,&quot; said Narayana. &quot;Listen, Vasishtha 
    begins to call you to Earth with songs, to Ayodhya by the sleepy Sarayu.&quot;</b></p>
