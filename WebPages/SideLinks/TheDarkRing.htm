<p><font size="+1"> <i>A Ring of Darkness</i> forged of gold in ancient time? 
  <i>A Secret Fellowship</i> dedicated to the destruction of the Ring? <i>A journey</i> 
  through the Lower World? And a realm called <i>Middle Earth</i>? Where even 
  <i>a Dragon</i> dwells? Where many other treasures lay hidden? The allure of 
  the Ring, the need to own it (its deepest meanings that is, and the power it 
  yields to those who know them)? Great hordes of spirits, less than divine, less 
  than <i>human</i> even, cruel, assembled on the battlefields of this world? 
  <i>orcs, droids</i> (wait! what movie is this? O well, the past and the future, 
  it is all the same. It is all the present)? All in the mindless service of <i>Sauron</i>, 
  <i>the Great Lord of Darkness</i> himself, and his need to own <i>the Ring of 
  Power</i>--his fierce, but also sometimes subtle and deceptive attempts to attain 
  <i>the Ring of Power</i>. So subtle is this <i>Dark Spell,</i> this influence 
  over the minds of men,<i> </i> that it even has <i>the Papacy of Isengard</i> 
  performing its unholy will, marshaling its forces against the great day of battle 
  and war. (Well not all are in its service, for as our merlin Gandalf knows full 
  well, and as he intimates to Frodo, the whole of creation, and all its various 
  other spirits, some as fierce even as <i>Sauron's</i> forces, also travails 
  together with <i>this Fellowship of the Ring</i>,<i> </i>hoping, almost beyond 
  hope it seems to some, for its own day of deliverance). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But there it is, the <i> Mountain of Doom</i> on the horizon. 
  <i>Fire, fire burning bright, signaling the end of Night. </i>And it is only 
  there, and then, that <i>the Ring of Darkness</i> can be destroyed--if only 
  the Fellowship can deliver <i>the Ring </i>that is<i>, </i> without succumbing 
  to its powers--to <i>the Dark side</i>--and without meeting a less-than-timely 
  end themselves (seeing that the hunt for those who know the mystery of<i> the 
  Ring</i>, those who could pose a threat to <i>Sauron's</i> rule, is already, 
  or rather, will soon be underway). And then there is this intervening episode 
  called <i>The Two Towers! </i>(How more uncanny and timely could this be? Who 
  wrote this story)? Of course these Two Towers represent the unholy relationship 
  of church and state. September 11th then? It symbolizes exactly what the Power 
  of the Universe thinks about this adulterous affair. (Revelation 17). And then 
  at last, <i>the Return of the King</i>? Ah, now we know who has <i>Their</i> 
  <i>hand</i> in this. For this has been the whole objective, the whole meaning 
  of the story all along, the Return of the True King(s). Kings? Well this is 
  another tale, or, rather, the real end of our present story. For in a world 
  of true harmony, and true balance, there must be Two. <i>He</i> is one, and 
  <i>She </i> is the other. <i>She</i>? Well let us not get our stories confused, 
  not just yet. They will blend into each other at the end. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the meantime, where else could the modern mind be treated 
  to such a journey, into this <i>make-believe</i>, but nevertheless wholly archetypal 
  world of legend and myth, than in the pages of Tolkien's own imagination, and 
  now more vividly as front-row participants in the motion-picture arts? Of Course 
  there was that other notable and collective journey that we all took together 
  to the realm of <i>Middle Earth</i>,<i> </i>but it seems so long ago now:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF OZ, WHEREVER THE ROAD MAY LEAD, by Dinita Smith...The 
    <i>Wizard of Oz</i> has worked its way into the national psyche as a fable 
    of eternal hope...&quot;It's like a religion,&quot; said Allison Laurie, who 
    was here to give a talk...An updated version of Patrick Hearn's version of 
    the classic, complete with references to Ezekiel and &quot;the Pilgrim's Progress&quot; 
    is being published this September...&quot;We travel together through the inner 
    world to find our way,&quot; the great-granddaughter of Frank Baum said. &quot;Initiates 
    must travel through the chaos of the windstorm to find the storm's center 
    point.&quot;<b> </b>The New York Times</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">(One can not understand yet how prophetic this article is). 
  And let us not leave out such other archetypal adventures as <i>Star Wars </i>and 
  <i>The Dark Crystal, </i>and to some other extents, such recent films depicting 
  man's journey into the realm of the subconscious and other-dimensional worlds 
  as, <i>Pi</i>, <i>Contact</i>, <i>Stigmata, Stargate, The Sixth Sense </i>and 
  <i>The Matrix. </i></font><font size="+1">And while we are passing by let us 
  not leave out the great list of foreign, and other socially significant, and 
  epic films that have been produced over the past, which were always a sign of 
  this industry's potential ability to inform the imagination and elevate the 
  mind of man in ways that other media alone could not. The art and science of 
  motion-pictures has become--thus fittingly--another 20th century technological 
  achievement (along with radio, television and computers), that has brought with 
  it, as all other things in the world of gods and men, the immense potential 
  for both good and evil. It all seems almost wholly bent now in the service of 
  <i>$auron</i>, sating, as it is, Western man's near-demonic need to be artificially 
  enthralled and continuously a-mused and entertained. Do we remember those Hollywood 
  Babylon days, all the decadence, the violence, the car crashes, the gangsters, 
  the cheap talk? and now our fixation with doctors, cops and lawyers, military 
  figures, helicopter crashes? Oh, and all the clich&eacute;s, the cheap humor, 
  the celebrity and idolatry, sit-com TV, the adolescence of it all. Austin Powers? 
  Rambo? (&quot;What with our Rambo heads and Terminator hearts,&quot; as one 
  critic put it, or was it &quot;Our Rambo hearts and Terminator heads&quot;)? 
  The visual media (television in particular...ABC, CNN, CNBC, MSNBC FOX) are 
  under the spell, and are employed in the service of <i>Sauron now</i> as one 
  of his own weapons of <i>mass distraction</i>, and as a tool of indoctrination. 
  It is all leading to war and the American people are being set up for it. (It 
  leads to the destruction of America itself...the Mount of Doom, remember)?. 
  As the Yellow press was to the American state of mind at the turn of the 20th 
  century, and in a different sense as Axis Salley and Tokyo Rose were to America 
  during World War II, the mainstream media, with all of its talking celebrities, 
  is to to the American people today--their spiritual enemies. (Revelation 18:2). 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><i>The Lord of the Rings,</i> nevertheless, demonstrates this 
  great potential for good. It represents the motion-picture industry's ability 
  to redeem itself (as the rest of us are redeemed), when finally all of its resources 
  and creative--almost magical--energies are turned in the service of the Light, 
  and not the Darkness as they presently are. (Who could have portrayed the mystic 
  descent into the abyss of human consciousness--into the depths of one's own 
  soul as it is--than was portrayed in Gandalf's fiery descent in the <i>Two Towers</i>? 
  At the same time, who was not enraptured at the marriage scene in Braveheart? 
  But then immediately trapped by the grandiosity and <i>heroic</i> manliness--the 
  madness if you will--of the battlescenes, as those Scots declared their independence 
  from the evil king of England. Evil indeed was this king, and they still are, 
  all of them. But in this spiritual twist in human logic it was the spirit of 
  <i>Sauron </i>in William Wallace himself, and not the king of England, that 
  has brought us to our present terrible dilemma. We could see the evil in Longshanks, 
  but it was hard to see in Wallace, and almost impossible to see in the founders 
  of the American government. We can see the &quot;evil&quot; in Saddam for instance, 
  but few in America can see it clearly in George Bush, or in themselves. We are 
  caught because our religious leaders (Sauron's agents) are under the spell of 
  <i>the Ring</i>, and have become unable to tell us what God is doing in the 
  earth, and thus because we do not know who <i>Sauron</i> is. We think he is 
  <i>them, </i>the enemies of America<i> </i>. But <i>them </i>is God (Romans 
  13)<i>. </i>And likewise, <i> Sauron </i> definetly wants control of <i>Middle 
  Earth</i> but his base of operations is not in that East over there as we might 
  imagine, but in this East over here, over here in the West. It's a ring remember, 
  a circle, and we have returned to it)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Thus this particular film represents this art-form's ability 
  to help us see into this world in which we are presently trapped, to open up 
  the hidden chambers and doorways of our own spiritual psyche. For even despite 
  itself, and its mainly decadent ways--largely unconscious of <i>God</i> as it 
  is (of the Absolute Oneness; the True Dark Lord, that Higher Force in the universe 
  that Gandolf spoke about, from whom both Good and Evil flows, the Force we must 
  trust if we are to escape the looming <i> Mountain of Doom</i>...&quot;Trust 
  the Force Luke&quot;)--God has been instructing all of us together in the very 
  subtle complexities of both good and evil (via an almost unimpeded exercise 
  of the liberal arts if you will), and channeling through this art-form all of 
  the necessary methods and techniques that would allow it, not only to accompany 
  the mind of Light into the coming age, but to help all of us together see into, 
  and through those dimensions of reality that have been by and large closed to 
  the great majority of us... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Not to all of us of course. The world has always had its Gandalfs, 
  its merlins, its sibyls and seers, its shamans and prophets. The truth is indeed, 
  stranger than fiction, and art can only attempt to imitate it, for in it we 
  have truly come full circle from Genesis to Revelation, from ancient Eden back 
  to Eden again. The script has already been written in the pages of Holy Writ, 
  and the film is playing now in the theater near you--in the spiritual realities 
  of our very own times.: </font></p>

  Western mysteries found their way out of these epic conflicts, to India, and

  open up the pages of the Rig Veda for instance, they would immediately see what 
  things passed back out of them into the Judeo-Christian mysteries at the time 
  of Moses, and again in the time of Christ (great Kabbalistic insights), as it 
  is also written: <i>And to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery...</i>Ephesians 
  3:9). <i>The Ring of Power</i> though was not lost, but was passed on as it 
  was intended to be (just as the <i>Fellowship of Light </i>in the earth was 
  not extinguished with the death of Abel, but had only just begun). For the Author 
  and Director of the story was making certain that it was passed from one generation 
  to the other, from one Dark lord to the next, from the figures of Cain, and 
  Nimrod--the first prototypical <i>strong man</i> in the earth--thus from the 
  ancient figure of Hammurabi into the emerging historical realities of the world 
  body-politic in the figure of Pharaoh, the first ruler of Egypt. God was now 
  establishing the rule of Darkness upon a base of power that had its origins 
  in, and whose structure could be traced directly back to the structure of the 
  Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil itself...</font></p>

  <p>&quot;Thank you Sam,&quot; (said Frodo). &quot;How far is there to go?&quot; 
    &quot;I don't know,&quot; said Sam, &quot;because I don't know where we're 
    going.&quot; He looked back, and then he looked up; and he was amazed to see 
    how far his last effort had brought him. <i>The Mountain of Doom</i> standing 
    ominous and alone had looked taller than it was. Sam saw now that it was less 
    lofty than the high passes of the Ephel Duath which he and Frodo just scaled. 
    The confused and tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe three 
    thousand feet above the plain, and above them was reared half as high again 
    its tall central cone...As he looked up...above him plainly a path or road. 
    It climbed like a rising girdle from the West and wound <i>snakelike</i> around 
    the Mountain, until before it went round out of view it reached the foot of 
    a cone upon its Eastern side.</p>
  <p>Sam could not see the course immediately above him, where it was lowest, 
    for a steep slope went up from where he stood; but he guessed that <i>if he 
    could only struggle on just a little way further up</i>, they would strike 
    this path. A gleam of hope returned to him. They might conquer the Mountain 
    yet. &quot;Why, it might have been put there a-purpose!&quot; he said to himself. 
    &quot;If it wasn't there, I'd have to say I was beaten in the end.&quot;...</p>
  <p>He did not know it, but he was looking at Sauron's Road from Barad-dur to 
    the Sammath Naur, the Chambers of Fire. <font size="2">(See 1 Peter 4:12)</font>. 
    Out of the Dark Tower's huge Western Gate it came over a deep abyss by a vast 
    bridge of iron, and then passing into the <i>plain </i>it ran about a league 
    between two smoking chasms, and so reached a long sloping causeway that led 
    up to the Mountain's eastern side. Thence, <i>turning and circling all its 
    wide girth from south to north</i>, it climbed at last, high in the upper 
    cone, but still high from the reeking summit, to the <i>dark entrance</i> 
    that gazed back east straight to<i> the Window of the Eye </i>in Sauron's 
    shadow-mantled fortress. Often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the 
    <i>Mountain's furnaces</i>, always the road was repaired and cleared again 
    <i>by the labors of countless orcs</i>.<i><font size="2">..</font></i><font size="2"><i>The 
    Return of the King</i>, by J.R.R. Tolkein, pp.218,219</font>.</p>
  <p>The light sprang up again, and there on the brink of the chasm, at the very 
    Crack of Doom, stood Frodo, black against the glare, tense, erect, but still 
    as if he had been turned to stone. &quot;Master!&quot; cried Sam.</p>
  <p>Then Frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice, indeed with a voice clearer 
    and more powerful than Sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above the throb 
    and turmoil of Mount Doom, ringing in the roofs and walls. &quot;I have come,&quot; 
    he said. &quot;But I do not choose now to do what I came to do. I will not 
    do this deed. The Ring is mine!&quot;...</p>
  <p>And far away, as Frodo put on the Ring and claimed it for his own, even in 
    Sammath Naur the very heart of his realm, the Power in Barad-dur was shaken, 
    <i>and the Tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter crown</i>. 
    The Dark Lord was suddenly aware of him, and his Eye piercing all shadows 
    looked across the plain to the door that he had made; <i>and the magnitude 
    of his own folly</i> <i>was revealed to him in a blinding flash</i>, and all 
    the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare. Then his wrath blazed in 
    consuming flame, but his fear rose lie a vast black smoke to choke him. For 
    he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung.</p>
  <p>From all his policies and webs of fear and treachery, from all his stratagems 
    and wars his mind shook free; and throughout his realm a tremor ran, his slaves 
    quailed, and his armies halted, and his captains suddenly steerless, bereft 
    of will, wavered and despaired. For they were forgotten. The whole mind and 
    purpose of the Power that wielded them was now bent with overwhelming force 
    upon the Mountain. At his summons, wheeling with a rending cry, in a last 
    desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the Nazgul, the Ringwraiths, 
    and with a storm of wings they hurtled southward to Mount Doom...<font size="2">p.223</font>.</p>

    fear and quake:</font></i></p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing

  <p><i><font size="+1">For our God is a consuming Fire...</font></i><font size="+1">(Hebrews 
    12:18-29).</font></p>
  <p>...Then came the day when Gandalf could not be found, and the Companions 
    wondered what was going forward. But Gandolf took Aragorn out from the City 
    by night, and he brought him to the southern Feet of Mount Mindolluin; and 
    there thay found a path made in ages past that few now dared to tread. For 
    it led up on to the mountain to a high hallow <i>where only the kings had 
    been wont to go</i>. And they went up by steep ways, until they came to a 
    high field below the snows that clad the lofty peaks, and it looked down over 
    the precipice that stood behind the City. And standing there they surveyed 
    the lands, <i>for the morning was come</i>, and they saw the towers of the 
    City far below them lie white pencils touched by the sunlight, and all the 
    vale of Anduin <i>was like a garden,</i> and <i>the Mountains of Shadow</i> 
    were veiled in golden mist. Upon the one side their sight reached to the grey 
    Emyn Muil, and the glint of Rauros was like a star twinkling far off; and 
    upon the other side <i>they saw the River</i> like a ribbon laid down to Pelargir, 
    and beyond that was the light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the Sea.</p>
  <p>And Gandalf said: &quot;<i>This is your realm, and the heart of the greater 
    realm that shall be</i>. The Third Age of the world is ended, <i>and the new 
    age is begun</i>; and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve 
    what may be preserved. For though much has been saved, much must now pass 
    away; and the power of the Three Rings also is ended. And all the lands that 
    you see, and those that lie round about them, shall be dwellings of Men. For 
    the time comes of the Dominion of Men, and the Elder Kindred shall fade or 
    depart.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I know it well, dear friend,&quot; said Aragorn; &quot;but I would 
    still have your counsel.&quot; &quot;Not for long now,&quot; said Gandalf. 
    &quot;The Third Age was my age. I was the enemy of Sauron, and my work is 
    finished. I shall go soon. The burden must lie now upon you and your kindred.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But I shall die,&quot; said Aragorn. &quot;For I am a mortal man, and 
    though being what I am and of the race of the West unmingled, I shall have 
    life far longer than other men, yet that is but a little while; and when those 
    who are now in the wombs of women are born and have grown old, I too shall 
    grow old. And who then shall govern Gondor <i>and those who look to this City 
    as to their Queen</i>, if my desire is not granted? <i>The Tree in the Court 
    of the Fountain</i> is still withered and barren. When shall I see a sign 
    that it will ever be otherwise?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Turn your face from the green world, and look where all seems barren 
    and cold!&quot; said Gandalf. Then Aragorn turned, and there was a stony slope 
    behind him running down from the skirts of the snow; and as he looked he was 
    aware that alone in the waste a growing thing stood. And he climbed to see 
    it, and saw that out of the very edge of the snow there sprang a Sapling Tree 
    no more than three foot high. <i>Already it had put forth young leaves</i> 
    long and shapely, dark above and silver beneath, and upon its slender crown 
    it bore one small cluster of flowers whose white petals shone like the sunlit 
    snow.</p>
  <p>Then Aragorn cried: &quot;<i>Ye utuvienyes! </i>I have found it! Lo! here 
    is <i>a scion of the Eldest of Trees!</i> But how comes it here? For it is 
    not itself <i>Seven</i> years old.&quot;</p>
  <p>And Gandalf coming looked at it, and said: &quot;Verily this is a sapling 
    of the line of Nimloth the fair; and it was a seedling of Galathilion, and 
    that a fruit of Telperion <i>of many names, Eldest of Trees</i>. Who shall 
    say how it comes here <i>in the appointed hour</i>? But this is an ancient 
    hallow, and ere the kings failed or the Tree withered in the court, a fruit 
    must have been sent here. For it is said, <i>though the fruit of the Tree 
    comes seldom to ripeness, yet the Life within may lie sleeping through many 
    long years, and none can foretell the time in which it will awake</i>.&quot;...</p>
  <p>And Aragorn planted the new Tree in the court by the Fountain, and swiftly 
    and gladly it began to grow; and when the month of June entered it was laden 
    with blossom.&quot;..pp.249,250.</p>

<p align="center">THE CORPORATION.COM</p>
<p align="center">A Film</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, the corporation was a relatively insignificant 
  entity. Today, it is a vivid, dramatic and pervasive presence in all our lives. 
  Like the Church, the Monarchy and the Communist Party in other times and places, 
  the corporation is today&#146;s dominant institution. But history humbles dominant 
  institutions. All have been crushed, belittled or absorbed into some new order. 
  The corporation is unlikely to be the first to defy history. In this complex 
  and highly entertaining documentary, Mark Achbar, co-director of the influential 
  and inventive MANUFACTURING CONSENT: NOAM CHOMSKY AND THE MEDIA, teams up with 
  co-director Jennifer Abbott and writer Joel Bakan to examine the far-reaching 
  repercussions of the corporation&#146;s increasing preeminence. Based on Bakan&#146;s 
  book <i>The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power</i>, the 
  film is a timely, critical inquiry that invites CEOs, whistle-blowers, brokers, 
  gurus, spies, players, pawns and pundits on a graphic and engaging quest to 
  reveal the corporation&#146;s inner workings, curious history, controversial 
  impacts and possible futures. Featuring illuminating interviews with Noam Chomsky, 
  Michael Moore, Howard Zinn and many others, THE CORPORATION charts the spectacular 
  rise of an institution aimed at achieving specific economic goals as it also 
  recounts victories against this apparently invincible force.</p>
<p> THE CORPORATION: Among the 40 interview subjects are CEOs and top-level executives 
  from a range of industries: oil, pharmaceutical, computer, tire, manufacturing, 
  public relations, branding, advertising and undercover marketing; in addition, 
  a Nobel-prize winning economist, the first management guru, a corporate spy, 
  and a range of academics, critics, historians and thinkers are interviewed. 
</p>
<p>A LEGAL &#147;PERSON&quot;: In the mid-1800s the corporation emerged as a legal 
  &#147;person.&#147; Imbued with a &#147;personality&#147; of pure self-interest, 
  the next 100 years saw the corporation&#146;s rise to dominance. The corporation 
  created unprecedented wealth. But at what cost? The remorseless rationale of 
  &#147;externalities&#148;&#151;as Milton Friedman explains: the unintended consequences 
  of a transaction between two parties on a third&#151;is responsible for countless 
  cases of illness, death, poverty, pollution, exploitation and lies. </p>
<p>THE PATHOLOGY OF COMMERCE: CASE HISTORIES: To more precisely assess the &#147;personality&#147; 
  of the corporate &#147;person,&#147; a checklist is employed, using actual diagnostic 
  criteria of the World Health Organization and the DSM-IV, the standard diagnostic 
  tool of psychiatrists and psychologists. The operational principles of the corporation 
  give it a highly anti-social &#147;personality&#148;: It is self-interested, 
  inherently amoral, callous and deceitful; it breaches social and legal standards 
  to get its way; it does not suffer from guilt, yet it can mimic the human qualities 
  of empathy, caring and altruism. Four case studies, drawn from a universe of 
  corporate activity, clearly demonstrate harm to workers, human health, animals 
  and the biosphere. Concluding this point-by-point analysis, a disturbing diagnosis 
  is delivered: the institutional embodiment of laissez-faire capitalism fully 
  meets the diagnostic criteria of a &#147;psychopath.&#148;</p>
<p>MINDSET: But what is the ethical mindset of corporate players? Should the institution 
  or the individuals within it be held responsible?</p>
<p>The people who work for corporations may be good people, upstanding citizens 
  in their communities&#151;but none of that matters when they enter the corporation&#146;s 
  world. As Sam Gibara, Chairman of Goodyear Tire, explains, &#147;If you really 
  had a free hand, if you really did what you wanted to do that suited your personal 
  thoughts and your personal priorities, you&#146;d act differently.&#147;</p>
<p>Ray Anderson, CEO of Interface, the world&#146;s largest commercial carpet 
  manufacturer, had an environmental epiphany and re-organized his $1.4 billion 
  company on sustainable principles. His company may be a beacon of corporate 
  hope, but is it an exception to the rule? </p>
<p>MONSTROUS OBLIGATIONS: A case in point: Sir Mark Moody-Stuart recounts an exchange 
  between himself (at the time Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell), his wife and a 
  motley crew of Earth First activists who arrived on the doorstep of their country 
  home. The protesters chanted and stretched a banner over their roof that read, 
  &#147;MURDERERS.&#147; The response of the surprised couple was not to call 
  the police, but to engage their uninvited guests in a civil dialogue, share 
  concerns about human rights and the environment and eventually serve them tea 
  on their front lawn. Yet, as the Moody-Stuarts apologize for not being able 
  to provide soy milk for their vegan critics&#146; tea, Shell Nigeria is flaring 
  unrivaled amounts of gas, making it one of the world's single worst sources 
  of pollution. And all the professed concerns about the environment do not spare 
  Ken Saro Wiwa and eight other activists from being hanged for opposing Shell's 
  environmental practices in the Niger Delta. </p>
<p>The Corporation exists to create wealth, and even world disasters can be profit 
  centers. Carlton Brown, a commodities trader, recounts with unabashed honesty 
  the mindset of gold traders while the twin towers crushed their occupants. The 
  first thing that came to their minds, he tells us, was: &#147;How much is gold 
  up?&#147; </p>
<p>PLANET INC.: You&#146;d think that things like disasters, or the purity of 
  childhood, or even milk, let alone water or air, would be sacred. But no. Corporations 
  have no built-in limits on what, who or how much they can exploit for profit. 
  In the fifteenth century, the enclosure movement began to put fences around 
  public grazing lands so that they might be privately owned and exploited. Today, 
  every molecule on the planet is up for grabs. In a bid to own it all, corporations 
  are patenting animals, plants, even your DNA. </p>
<p>Around things too precious, vulnerable, sacred or important to the public interest, 
  governments have, in the past, drawn protective boundaries against corporate 
  exploitation. Today, governments are inviting corporations into domains from 
  which they were previously barred. </p>
<p>PERCEPTION MANAGEMENT : The Initiative Corporation spends $22 billion worldwide 
  placing its clients&#146; advertising in every imaginable&#151;and some unimaginable&#151;media. 
  One new medium: very young children. Their &#147;Nag Factor&#147; study dropped 
  jaws in the world of child psychiatry. It was designed not to help parents cope 
  with their children&#146;s nagging, but to help corporations design their ads 
  and promotions so that children would nag for their products more effectively. 
  Initiative Vice President Lucy Hughes elaborates: &#147;You can manipulate consumers 
  into wanting, and therefore buying your products. It&#146;s a game.&#147;</p>
<p>Today people can become brands. And brands can build cities. And university 
  students can pay for their educations by shilling on national television for 
  a credit card company. And a corporation even owns the rights to the popular 
  song &#147;Happy Birthday.&#148; Do you ever get the feeling it&#146;s all a 
  bit much? Corporations have invested billions to shape public and political 
  opinion. When they own everything, who will stand for the public good?</p>
<p>THE PRICE OF WHISTLEBLOWING: It turns out that standing for the public good 
  is an expensive proposition. Ask Jane Akre and Steve Wilson, two investigative 
  reporters fired by Fox News after they refused to water down a story on rBGH, 
  a synthetic hormone widely used in the United States (but banned in Europe and 
  Canada) to rev up cows&#146; metabolism and boost their milk production. Because 
  of the increased production, the cows suffer from mastitis, a painful infection 
  of the udders. Antibiotics must then be injected, which find their way into 
  the milk, and ultimately reduce people&#146;s resistance to disease. </p>
<p>Fox demanded that they rewrite the story, and ultimately fired Akre and Wilson. 
  Akre and Wilson subsequently sued Fox under Florida&#146;s whistle-blower statute. 
  They proved to a jury that the version of the story Fox would have had them 
  put on the air was false, distorted or slanted. Akre was awarded $425,000. Then 
  Fox appealed, the verdict was overturned on a technicality, and Akre lost her 
  award. [For more information on the case see www.foxbghsuit.com]</p>
<p>DEMOCRACY LTD.: Democracy is a value that the corporation just doesn&#146;t 
  understand. In fact, corporations have often tried to undo democracy if it is 
  an obstacle to their single-minded drive for profit. From a 1934 business-backed 
  plot to install a military dictator in the White House (undone by the integrity 
  of one U.S. Marine Corps General, Smedley Darlington Butler) to present-day 
  law-drafting, corporations have bought military might, political muscle and 
  public opinion.</p>
<p>And corporations do not hesitate to take advantage of democracy&#146;s absence 
  either. One of the most shocking stories of the twentieth century is Edwin Black&#146;s 
  recounting IBM&#146;s strategic alliance with Nazi Germany&#151;one that began 
  in 1933 in the first weeks that Hitler came to power and continued well into 
  World War II.</p>
<p>FISSURES: The corporation may be trying to render governments impotent, but 
  since the landmark WTO protest in Seattle, a rising wave of networked individuals 
  and groups have decided to make their voices heard. Movements to challenge the 
  very foundations of the corporation are afoot: The charter revocation movement 
  tried to bring down oil giant Unocal; a groundbreaking ballot initiative in 
  Arcata, California, put a corporate agenda in the public spotlight in a series 
  of town hall meetings; in Bolivia, the population fought and won a battle against 
  a huge transnational corporation brought in by their government to privatize 
  the water system; in India nearly 99% of the basmati patent of RiceTek was overturned; 
  and W. R. Grace and the U.S. government&#146;s patent on Neem was revoked.</p>
<p>As global individuals take back local power, a growing re-invigoration of the 
  concept of citizenship is taking root. It has the power to not only strip the 
  corporation of its seeming omnipotence, but to create a feeling and an ideology 
  of democracy that is much more than its mere institutional version.</p>

<p align="center"> The End of Suburbia Oil Depletion and the Collapse of The American 
  Dream</p>
<p align="center">A Film<br>
  www.endofsuburbia.com<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Since World War II North Americans have invested much of their newfound wealth 
  in suburbia. It has promised a sense of space, affordability, family life and 
  upward mobility. As the population of suburban sprawl has exploded in the past 
  50 years, so too the suburban way of life has become embedded in the American 
  consciousness.</p>
<p>Suburbia, and all it promises, has become the American Dream. But as we enter 
  the 21st century, serious questions are beginning to emerge about the sustainability 
  of this way of life. With brutal honesty and a touch of irony, The End of Suburbia 
  explores the American Way of Life and its prospects as the planet approaches 
  a critical era, as global demand for fossil fuels begins to outstrip supply. 
  World Oil Peak and the inevitable decline of fossil fuels are upon us now, some 
  scientists and policy makers argue in this documentary. The consequences of 
  inaction in the face of this global crisis are enormous. What does Oil Peak 
  mean for North America? As energy prices skyrocket in the coming years, how 
  will the populations of suburbia react to the collapse of their dream? Are today's 
  suburbs destined to become the slums of tomorrow? And what can be done NOW, 
  individually and collectively, to prepare?</p>
<p>Hosted by Barrie Zwicker. Featuring James Howard Kunstler, Peter Calthorpe, 
  Michael Klare, Richard Heinberg, Matthew Simmons, Mike Ruppert, Julian Darley, 
  Colin Campbell, Kenneth Deffeyes, Ali Samsam Bakhtiari and Steve Andrews. Directed 
  by Gregory Greene. Produced by Barry Silverthorn.</p>
<p>DVD BONUS: Includes the vintage short films, In the Suburbs and Destination 
  Earth. Also includes producer and director commentary and edited audio for audiences 
  under 18 years. Duration: 78 minutes <br>
  <br>
  Reviews:<br>
  This information is quite shocking. I think many people who thought they had 
  sufficient knowledge concerning the energy crisis will be left in rethinking 
  mode - Jim, Los Angeles</p>
<p>The film was quite frightening and I am sure many will say these scientists 
  are just alarmists -- but it's so true that petrol and our American way of life 
  cannot and will not last forever, especially since we are so oil dependent and 
  energy hungry. Over the ages other great empires fell; but this time there will 
  be greater, far-reaching consequence because of globalization - Anais, Pasadena</p>
<p>End of Surburbia is a perfect tool for introducing people to peak oil. Just 
  enough humor to sugarcoat the bitter pill. Image and sound convey forcefully 
  what can otherwise be a somewhat abstract issue, often couched in lots of confusing 
  numbers and charts and theories. It felt good to have the documentary screened 
  at a place like pathtofreedom, where people can see a practical alternative 
  all around them as they're digesting the rather bleak message. At least people 
  can get a glimpse of what they can do to minimize the impact of oil depletion 
  in the scope of their own lives. Once you start to look deeply into the peak 
  oil picture, it gets very depressing very quickly. And a lot of pessimists and 
  misanthropes are attracted to it, adding to the vibe of hopelessness--which 
  is, of course, paralyzing in itself. I think as Peak Oil kicks in it will be 
  a kind of &quot;dark night of the collective soul.&quot; We need to be able 
  to look deeply into the worst possible outcomes (resource wars, &quot;dieoff&quot; 
  etc.) and yet fashion a creative and human way through it all - Jason, Van Nuys</p>
<p>Thanks for having us over last night and sharing. We enjoyed ourselves though 
  the subject matter of the film was a little frightening (and heartening as well, 
  since without cheap energy this culture will have to give up its wasteful ways). 
  Anyway its good to see people like you making a difference. - Suzy</p>
<p>I just saw the documentary &quot;The End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and The 
  Collapse of The American Dream &quot;, at Friday night's opening in Toronto. 
  The film begins with the quote from Thomas Hardy, found also at the beginning 
  of the dieoff site: &quot;If a path to the better there be, it begins with a 
  full look at the worst.&quot; In fact, the film does not look at the worst. 
  It is cleverly packaged for the uninitiated by focusing on North American land 
  use patterns to segue to the peak oil story, and by deftly avoiding excess discussion 
  of depopulation doom and gloom and political intrigue, it will probably get 
  past many people's denial-generating defences. Interviews with many of the usual 
  suspects are included, and most of the salient information is there. The film 
  is entertaining, and some parts are quite funny (not surprising if you've read 
  Kunstler).</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend the DVD, especially if you are a newbie, or if 
  you have some skeptics in your life, or just audiences you want to introduce 
  to the topic including those who are challenged by time or reading. Despite 
  some subtle signs of a low budget, the film is very well crafted, and most importantly, 
  is based on the right marketing decisions (i.e. understanding the audience). 
  Kudos to producer Barry Silverthorn and his team. This work will definitely 
  open some eyes. It will be interesting to watch what happens as this is shown.- 
  Rose Kudlac, Toronto (posted at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RunningOnEmpty2) 
</p>
<p>A new film, &#145;The End of Suburbia&#146; had its opening in Toronto Friday. 
  Full information on it is at http://www.endofsuburbia.com. Directed by Gregory 
  Greene and produced by Barry Silverthorn this film paints a startling picture 
  of the end of North American society as we know it. The reason for the catastrophe 
  is that global demand for fossil fuels is beginning to outstrip supply. World 
  oil production has peaked and it will soon start dropping as the remaining oil 
  is more difficult to extract. Prices could start to rise unbearably in as little 
  as two or three years. </p>
<p>That means there will be no growth, only continuing recessions, shortages and 
  blackouts. Suburbia will collapse because the auto based world is fast becoming 
  a dinosaur. East to west and north to south, America is one vast city serviced 
  by oil that will no longer be available at low prices. I would say the movie 
  is a must see because it demonstrates that our way of life is most definitely 
  unsustainable. Where it comes up short is on answers and ways to salvage a society 
  facing collapse. I have a few answers of my own and they combine with ideas 
  from the movie to paint this picture. - Gary Morton, http://CitizensontheWeb.ca
