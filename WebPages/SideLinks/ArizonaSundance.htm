  Joseph said, reflecting on the purification rites and sweat lodge ceremony we 
  had just completed. We had arrived at the sacred Sundance grounds that morning, 
  after a week on the road between West Virginia and the town of Pinon, located 
  on the Navajo reservation southwest of Four Corners. It was Monday, three days 
  before the Sundance itself was to begin. (By Thursday we would witness one of 
  the most sublime expressions of the Christian mysteries that one could experience 
  as yet in our time):</font></p>

    to the Going Down of the same)</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>

    that is in bitterness for his firstborn...</font></i><font size="+1">(Zechariah 
    12:9,10).</font></p>

    2:20). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"> Many were already there, others were still arriving, 
  from all directions. The temporary village was coming alive, preparations were 
  underway. The stones (of fire) used in the lodges were already piled high at 
  the perimeter of the sweat lodge circle. Next to the stones was an even higher 
  mountain of firewood brought in by truck from California. The fire at the center 
  of the circle had already been kindled, and would be maintained continuously, 
  day and night, by a team of individuals chosen mostly from among those who had 
  come as visitors from outside the Native American community. Each would take 
  turns watching over the fire for the next seven days until the ceremonies were 
  complete. It was a trusted position, and an honor to be asked, said several 
  of the firekeepers. We were reminded of the ordinances at Leviticus 6:9-13. 
  (I have already written something of the Sweat Lodge ceremony itself in a chapter 
  entitled <i>A Journey of Atonement</i>, so I will not say much more about it 
  here except that it is the same ordeal, and moreso). </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Campsites and tents were appearing, creating the 
  natural pattern of pathways and streets that would define the village throughout 
  the week. The communal work was proceeding with loving efficiency. People moved 
  about joyfully and quietly, some knowing what needed to be done, others eager 
  and willing to do it. Structures were being assembled, electric wires layed 
  out, trash gathered, and everywhere one looked people were busy helping each 
  other. The arbor that surrounded the Sundance circle and the adjacent shelter 
  that shielded the dancers during their rest periods, were being covered with 
  fresh foliage brought in from the surrounding hillsides. The women gathered 
  sage for the ceremonies. The family camped next to us, who invited us to their 
  fire and to sit at their table each evening, gave us a loving bouquet of sage 
  and sea-feathers to take with us when we left. It was wrapped in a string of 
  tiny seashells that one of the mothers in their family clan had gathered along 
  the Gulf of Mexico. This family, so typical of all the people who came together 
  to participate in the Sundance, were truly the salt of God's earth. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Several of the women in this family were racially 
  profiled by the Texas police as they made their way from their homes near the 
  Gulf to the Sundance in Arizona. They were ordered to unload their vehicle, 
  and were made to stand along the roadside in the broad daylight as the policemen 
  amusingly went through their personal belongings. Indigenous peoples and others 
  of color, migrants and long-haired people of various persuasion, are used to 
  being treated in this manner. Several of us were profiled and pulled over by 
  the California Highway Police several months earlier in the southern part of 
  that state. The two patrolmen (<i>beastly in nature</i> is the only term I can 
  use to describe them, perhaps just <i>frightened </i>and <i>ignorant of the 
  things that God is bringing to pass in the earth</i> is a more compassionate 
  description) screamed at us as they approached the car (a tactic used by the 
  police and military to intimidate and subdue their objectives), and continued 
  to do so in the most disrespectful way until they finally <i>allowed</i> us 
  to continue our journey. The only thing they found to charge us with was improper 
  use of seat belts. The Texas policemen said that they had reason (also purely 
  unfounded) to believe that this family was carrying drugs or other controlled 
  substances. We can be assured, given the nation's history--and the present climate 
  of paranoia and fear (the emerging state of patriotic fascism) in America, coupled 
  with the realization that law enforcement agencies across the country are being 
  granted broad authority to violate peoples' spiritual and political rights--that 
  the situation will only intensify. It was all written, however, and will prove 
  to be America's (Babylon's) (Egypt's) (modern Atlantis's) downfall as the true 
  human beings in this country come together in the center to rededicate themselves 
  to God, and to form themselves at last as the one true spiritual nation that 
  God has been creating in the earth all of these millennia, indeed, since the 
  time of <i>First Man </i>and <i>First Woman </i>in the garden of Eden...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In connection with this story,

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Navajo legends are not only 
    the basis of the complex ceremonials, they are also the history of the Navajos, 
    much as the Old Testament is both the Judaic religious base and the history 
    of the ancient Jews. The New Testament is not only the history of the first 
    Christians, it is the foundation of Christianity. Hence, the Legends are, 
    in fact, the Navajo's version of his own history. The all-important Story 
    of Creation, also called the Story of Emergence, is retold in its entirety, 
    in the most sacred of all Navajo ceremonials, the Nine-day Blessing Way, much 
    as a rabbi might instruct a Jewish child in the Books of Moses or a priest 
    might read the story of Christ to his congregation...</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first part of 
    the Navajo Story of Creation parallels the Biblical Book of Genesis in that 
    it tells of the Creation of the world. In fact the Navajo concept of the world 
    is not unlike the early Judaaic-Christian concept which described the earth 
    as a land area floating in an immense ocean overspread by a solid domed heaven 
    which fit like a great lid with its edges on the horizon, resting on supports 
    in the water. Above the sky was still another similarly domed world. </font>(As 
    Paul has said: <i>Seek those things which are above</i>)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The Navajo Story of Creation traces the evolution of life through Four such 
    underworlds until the People emerged in this, the Fifth and present world. 
    As the People passed through each of the four first world's, they went through 
    a process of evolution, starting out as insects and finally becoming people 
    as we know them today in the fourth world--with the explicit aid of the gods. 
    Above this Fifth World there is yet another world where all things blend into 
    one with the cosmos. </font>The Book of the Navajo, by Raymond Friday Locke,

<p align="left"><font size="+1">One </font><font size="+1"> native man introduced 
  himself as Tom. (We have learned that among Native Americans, Navajos have also 
  acquired the use of European or English names with which they introduce themselves 
  and do business with the world outside their own, concealing, as is also the 
  custom, their own given, or <i>War </i>names received at birth. This custom 
  expresses the deeper spiritual realization that every soul born into the earth 
  has a true identity, one that is just as often concealed from the individual 
  soul itself. Sometimes, however, a given, or even an acquired name, is a reflection 
  of this true identity). He said that he (like Thomas, his acquired namesake) 
  was a lecturer, and that he traveled from place to place speaking to others 
  of the Navajo way of life. &quot;We do not have a religion. White men have religion...one 
  that he practices on a single day of the week, and strife with divisions,&quot; 
  he said. &quot;The Navajos, and other indigenous peoples, have <i>a Way of Life</i>,&quot; 
  he went on to say, &quot;Every thing we think and say, and do, every day of 
  the week and at every hour of each day, is a reflection of our <i>Way of Life</i>.&quot; 
  This, of course, is also the way with the true children of Light everywhere 
  else throughout the earth, regardless of the tradition (or branch of the Tree) 
  each has appeared from. (And though these sons and daughters of Light seem at 
  present to be hardly more than an impotent, and voiceless remnant in the earth, 
  their presence here and their work will soon be manifest).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Mormon doctrines aside, there has been contact 
  between the adepts and shamans of this continent and those of the East three 
  times, all prior to the European conquests of the last Five-hundred years. Each 
  time there was an exchange of ideas and doctrines, uniting the two. (Every student 
  of the Divine Mystery can see into the structural patterns of these ideas and 
  realize that they are the same). The first was at the time of Eden, before the 
  final wars and collapse of the Atlantean age. (Please open the Book of Genesis 
  and understand the historical theories upon which this entire work is based, 
  thus the words: <i>As it was in the days of Noah</i>). The next was at the time 
  of the fabled kings, David and Solomon:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament 
    sheweth his handiwork.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth 
    knowledge.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">THERE IS NO SPEECH NOR LANGUAGE, WHERE THEIR VOICE IS 
    NOT HEARD.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">THEIR LINE IS GONE OUT THROUGH ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR 
    WORDS TO THE END OF THE WORLD. IN THEM HE HATH SET A TABERNACLE FOR THE SUN</font></i><font size="+1">...(Psalm 
    19:1-6). </font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Solomon reigned in a peaceable time, and was honored; 
    for God made all quiet round about him, that he might build an house in His 
    Name, and prepare His sanctuary for ever.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">How wise wast thou in thy youth, and as a flood, filled 
    with understanding!</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thy soul covered the whole earth, and thou filledst it 
    with dark parables.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thy name went far unto the islands; and for thy peace

<p align="left"><font size="+1">The Phoenicians were sailing constantly across 
  the Dark Atlantic in those times, from one continent to the other, just as a 
  remnant of them were still making the voyage from Britain in the time of Christ. 
  (Please read <i>Lost Cities of North and Central America, </i>by David Hatcher 
  Childress). Thus the third point of contact was at the time of Christ itself, 
  when the truly historical Quetzalcoatl walked the American continent. This teacher, 
  whom the Western world knows as the Apostle Paul, came across the sea, &quot;on 
  eagle's wings&quot; as it was, from the Serpent-continent of Europe. He came, 
  along with others, connecting in his own thoughts, and in the life of the early 
  church, all of the sacred and historical dimensions of the World Tree. He came 
  learning, as well as teaching the precepts of the Solar Mysteries, the Great 
  Lodge (Solomon's Temple) and the doctrines of True Peace among the inhabitants 
  of the earth:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For the same cause did Paul in like manner receive the 
    reward of his patience. Seven times he was in bonds; he was whipped, he was 
    stoned; he preached both in the East and in the West: leaving behind him the 
    glorious report of his faith.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And so having taught the whole world righteousness, and 
    for that end travelled even to the utmost bounds of the West; he at last suffered 
    martyrdom at the command of the governors...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Clement 3:13,14; Psalm 19:1-6). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">These are the doctrines that the great sons of 
  Darkness are violating in the earth at this time, and for which the nations 
  are now being judged. These are the same doctrines, and the same spirit that 
  the leaders of the Sacred Sundance Ceremonies are attempting to revive among 
  the people, for which they, and the many others who have participated in them, 
  are still willing to sacrifice and to suffer. These are among the true Christs 
  in the earth in our time. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Chief Arvol Lookinghorse, of the Lakota Sioux, and his wife 
  Paula, among the revered leaders of this year's ceremonies at Pinon, had just 
  returned from Durbin, South Africa, where they once again labored to observe 
  a World Peace and Prayer Day Ceremony, linking it, as they have before, to the 
  day of the Summer Solstice observed by people everywhere throughout the world. 
  Chief Lookinghorse is the nineteenth generation keeper of the Sacred Peace Pipe 
  which was brought to the Plains Indians by the mysterious White Buffalo Calf 
  Woman many years ago, along with the Seven Ordinances which were to govern its 
  proper use. According to Sioux tradition the bowl of the Sacred Pipe represents 
  the Earth, and the clay from which all the children of the Earth are created. 
  It represents the Sacred Place from which all true offerings and sincere prayers 
  originate. The stem of the Sacred Pipe represents the life of the Sacred Tree 
  itself, the Central Pillar of the Sacred Oracles and the <i>Axis Mundi</i> of 
  the entire Universe. </font></p>

    history of the tribe that have been passed down from father to son, from generation

    there must be in any oral history, but the variations are slight and the characteristics 
    are always the same, though they are, as in the case of Ests'anatlehi (Changing 
    Woman, also called Turquoise Woman) and her sister Yolkai' Ests'an (White 
    Shell Woman), sometimes interchangeable. But this is an abstraction that is 
    perfectly clear to the Navajo although perhaps difficult for whites to comprehend.

  She is Sarah (Sarasvati) the Goddess of Wisdom. She is Isis, mother of the hawk-eyed 
  Horus. She is Deborah of the Bee Hive, guardian of the meanings of the sacred 
  number Six. She is Anna, of the Great Circle. She is Mary, the Waters of Life. 
  She is the Magdalene, Thunder, Perfect Mind. She is <i>Shekinah, </i>the Feminine 
  side of God. <i>She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold upon Her: and happy 
  is every one that retaineth Her. </i>(Proverbs 3:18). And we all saw her very 
  clearly, Oldest Wise Woman, frail of body, strong of Spirit, whose dreams and 
  visions are being fulfilled in the Sacred Sundance Ceremonies at Pinon, Arizona. 
  We watched her as she moved about the village in the loving and respectful company 
  of her sons, her daughters and her grandchildren. We watched, amazed and inspired, 
  as she entered the sweat lodge with all her handmaidens. And we stood around 
  her as she opened the ceremonies with her presence and her words, and as she 
  blessed the ground in which the Sacred Tree was to be raised. We see Her everywhere

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the Southeastern 
    foothills of Big Mountain: We wish to say our words to our Indigenous brothers 
    and sisters and other concerned people. By now you have heard the news that 
    we were recently under military seige (armed Hopi Rangers, armed Navajo Police, 
    armed BIA police). They were there to stop our nation to nation ceremony (Sacred 
    Sundance). The opposition was so heavy hardly anything moved in or out. We 
    had to use the ancient roads because the borders were closed by road blocks 
    full of armed police, Navajo and Hopi, both sides turning back people, supplies, 
    water, food, medicine and doctors were even turned away for five days. For 
    three days no one could go in or out. If you tried to come back in, you would 
    get arrested or fined up to $1000 per day. Even hauling water could get you 
    arrested.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They tried to stop 
    the Sacred Sundance Tree (Cottonwood) but by the Sundance chief and the Sundancers 
    and the local residents' choice and courage the beautiful Sacred Tree went 
    in the ground. Yes, it is a war against the grandmothers here in America, 
    and now the Tree stands tall and strong, and represents birthright to our 
    sacred land. It also represents all indigenous peoples' right to pray, and 
    it represents the respect for all indigenous ceremonies and beliefs. With 
    dignity and strong prayers the Sacred Tree went up representing all humanity's 
    equal rights and religious freedom rights, not only for one, not only for 
    a few but for everybody.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you to those 
    brothers and sisters who had the courage to go through guns to come pray with 
    us...</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CHIEF ARVOL LOOKINGHORSE'S 
    STATEMENT </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I Chief Arvol Lookinghorse...would 
    like to offer a statement concerning the violation against the Sacred Sundance 
    Ceremony at Big Mountain, Arizona. The Sacred White Buffalo Calf Bundle that 
    I care for consists of Seven Sacred Rights and one of them is the Sundance. 
    Because of this responsibility, my work is toward world peace and global healing. 
    As our ceremonies are connected to the Sacred Mother including her well-being 
    preserved for generations to come, the Sacred Tree represents all life upon 
    Mother earth. A very important protocol in putting up the Sacred Tree with 
    its offerings of prayers for all life including health for our relatives, 
    is that the ceremony and energy must not be broken or stopped. This ceremony 
    has been with the Sacred Bundle for nineteen generations. We have shared this 
    ceremony for health and well-being with other indigenous nations to bring 
    spiritual awareness and strength back to nations. When I heard of the Hopi 
    Nation's attitude and violations to a spiritual ceremony, I had to realize 
    that it was not the Hopi Nation, but rather a group of people who have been 
    affected by the &quot;disease of the mind.&quot; This disease that has spread 
    throughout Turtle Island to many honorable nations that have made decisions 
    affecting relationships toward their 'brothers and sisters&quot; of indigenous 
    nations, including the violation toward our Mother Earth.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In my peace works 
    I was honored to sit with many Hopi traditional elders, including the late 
    Thomas Banyanca, who had the most deepest respect for all ceremonies, as we 
    shared the Sacred C'anupa (pipe) together. We understood that our work and 
    message was the same. His concern for his people violating their own culture 
    and traditions was the same as mine. There are many other &quot;traditional 
    Hopi&quot; who understand the proper protocol to ceremonies and would not 
    think and do anything toward violating one another in interrupting a sacred 
    rite. So this brings my thoughts to those who do not understand who they are 
    as a Hopi, a person that holds a bloodline to their ancestors that walked 
    in honor and ceremony. Many nations have these kind of people that are not 
    aware of the blood (the history) that carry in their veins and responsibility 
    to bring honor to their people by making wise decisions based on compassion, 
    understanding and respect.</font> </p>

  with the authorities and the corporations) the kitchen was being set up, tables 
  cleaned, floors swept, wood chopped, a cookfire lit and the coffee on. An abundant

  and soon afterwards large pots and cauldrons of delicious stew and vegetable 
  soups were on the table. Then the older Navajo women appeared (giving Barbara

  and who organized the kitchen for the days ahead, a rest from their duties so 
  that they could attend the ceremonies), and soon after that a steady stream 
  of tortillas and fry bread was also on the menu. There was work to do that men 
  did best, the heavy work and the lifting and such, and work that women did best. 
  But it didn't matter. There were no rules, everyone crossed roles when they 
  saw a need to or when they were asked to. The cement block and pine-pole building, 
  set off some distance from the campsites and ceremonial grounds, became the 
  joyful gathering place for workers, dancers, local indigenous people and visitors 
  from afar, children and elders, the young and old. The conversation at the communal 
  tables was always warm and friendly, sometimes serious and informative. A deep, 
  quiet, abiding respect for everyone, and for all things and all ideas, was the 
  unwritten and unspoken rule. The only interruption was the spontaneous laughter 
  that so often seasoned the atmosphere.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">By Wednesday, however, the atmosphere became more 
  solemn. There was still the conversation, the children and the laughter, and 
  the joyful and orderly confusion, but this was also the day that almost the 
  entire community would work together in both prayerful support and physical 
  labor to bring the old Tree down from its place at the center of the ceremonial 
  grounds, and to set the new Tree up. (The tradition insists that the Sundance 
  ceremonies begin within twenty-four hours of this exchange). There is a cosmic 
  abundance of symbolism in these rituals (the very same, in fact, as are found 
  in the Passover and High Holy Day festivals of the Jews, the Easter and Pentecost 
  rituals of Christianity and the Ramadan observances of Islam). The old Tree 
  was set up a year ago, and has stood there against the desert sky the whole 
  time as an offering. It has born on its sacred limbs, as the Earth completed 
  one full circuit in space around its own source of Life and Light, the heartfelt 
  prayers and petitions of the people...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>Sunrise over the Arizona desert.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/SunRise3.gif" width="347" height="531"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Thus the old Tree was the focus then, as the new 
  Tree will be this year, and the sacred center around which the entire Sundance 
  was performed. The old Tree was decorated, as the New Tree was again this year, 
  with garlands of colorful cloth ties and prayer streamers, offerings of tobacco 
  and other healing herbs, and then raised up by the people as a sign of their 
  connection and their deep reverence for the mysteries of heaven and earth. The 
  Sacred Tree is the connection between the two. The seven colors represent Heaven 
  above, Earth below, the Four directions of time and space, as well as each of 
  the directions of Human consciousness, and the Universe itself which both emanates 
  from the Center and encompasses all. (At Pinon it seems that the first six are 
  sufficient). As the old Tree is taken down it will represent the generations 
  that have passed, and all the elders who have already passed on into the Spirit 
  world. As the new Tree is set up it will represent the present generations and 
  all of the ideas and thoughts that we carry with us today--old thoughts and 
  new thoughts, old understandings and new understandings. As the Tree grows, 
  and the Universe expands, so does the human mind grow and expand with them. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">After the old Tree was laid to rest out on the 
  desert, next to the others that went on before it (its broken sticks and branches 
  reverently picked up and laid there with it), all the people headed in a joyful 
  caravan of trucks and other vehicles from the Sundance grounds at Pinon, along 
  the tribal road to Chinley and on into Canyon de Chelly where the new Tree would 
  be selected, cut down, brought back and raised up. The Tree was found growing 
  out of the base of a small cliff, on the other side of a dried out wash running 
  through the canyon. The Navajo people have many memories of things that happened 
  in this canyon. The death of Narbona comes readily to mind. Narbona was one 
  of the chief men of the Navajos at the time the American government was making 
  military and commercial incursions into this land, seeking to exploit it for 
  what mineral and other natural resources it could find. Narbona, facing the 
  cold reality of it all, was among those seeking a peaceful resolution to the 
  troubles. The government had other things in mind, and other plans afoot: a 
  design upon the land itself and the forced removal of the people themselves 
  if necessary. It had even sent a certain Colonel Washington into <i>Dinetah</i> 
  (a Navajo name for both the land and the way of life of the people), to carry 
  it out. He was a ruthless veteran of the atrocities just recently committed 
  at that time against the Cherokee people. In the ensuing deceptions being enforced 
  upon the Navajo, confusion erupted over the terms of the treaty and the demands 
  being made by the Americans, the Navajo resisted, and canon were fired at the 
  people. According to the reports Narbona, the ageing headman, was hit four or 
  five times...and then summarily and dishonorably <i> scalped </i>by the American 
  troops. I thanked the present Navajo headmen in my thoughts, and the others 
  who were there in the canyon this day, for not carrying a grudge and holding 
  those things against the whites who were gathered along with them, partaking 
  now in these sacred ceremonies. Nevertheless, as all the men lined up, each 
  waiting to take a turn with the axe, each having received a blessing by the 
  elder Lakota priest, David (Dave Chief), each surrounded by the prayers of all 
  the others, the words would not stay out of my mind<i>: </i></font><i><font size="+1">Now 
  is the axe laid to the root of the tree, and every tree that bringeth forth 
  not good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire.</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Nor could one fail to see the further imagery<i> 
  </i>as the felled Tree was being carried across the dry river bed, through the 
  small woods to the flat bed truck that would take it to the ceremonial grounds. 
  As it was being hoisted onto the truck, wrestled into position, and then tied 
  down, some of us mentioned to each other how closely this resembled some Christ-figure 
  being tied down and carried to a place of execution. The stricken Tree had now 
  taken on the aura of a <i>sacrificial</i> offering. A Native American man standing 
  by, hearing the conversation, walked over and said: &quot;Oh but you are quite 
  right. In fact you have no idea how closely the stories in the Bible are being 
  enacted in these ceremonies.&quot; The truth of what he said was clear to see 
  as the Tree was raised up...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/SunRise5.gif" width="346" height="530"></p>
<p align="center"><b>The Sacred Tree of Life</b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"> Through the fork in its limbs was tied a crossbeam 
  of choke cherry branches, forming the cross, or the crucifix upon which the 
  Universal Christ is offered for the transgressions of the whole world. And then 
  from the upper limbs and branches of this Tree hung the ropes from which each 
  of the Sundancers would pierce and suspend themselves over the next four days 
  in both a deeply individual as well as communal reenactment of these historic 
  mysteries. Neither was the Tree consecrated without the presence of two virginal 
  young women, further symbolizing the purity of heart and mind that the people 
  were bringing collectively to these sacred observances. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">That evening, as darkness fell, the dancers--some 
  gathered at the communal kitchen, some around their own campfires or at the 
  campsites of others--solemnly and quietly enjoyed a <i>last supper </i> as it 
  were, the last morsels of food, and the last taste of water (save for a small 
  amount to sustain the body throughout the four days of sweat lodge ceremonies 
  still to follow), that any of them would share again until the ceremonies were 
  complete. It would be a complete fast until Sunset four days later, a (more 
  than mere) ritual isolation from the physical world as each of the dancers began 
  the inward journey to the spiritual world of the Tree of Life. (At the Sacred 
  Mountains Sundance only Native people are permitted to participate in the Dance 
  itself. This is understandable. I myself was more than happy, overjoyed and 
  mystified, just to be there. It was less than a year ago that I had made a prayer 
  while passing through South Dakota, asking simply to be invited somehow or somewhere 
  to a Sundance ceremony. Events in the world unfolded, one new acquaintance led 
  to another, an e-mail appears on the screen saying, &quot;Yes, of course you 
  are invited. Let us know when you will arrive.&quot; Thank you Chris, thank 
  you Paula and Arvol, thank you Paul, Thank you Father, thank you Mother). </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">The call was heard throughout the camp. The dancers 
  bid fond love and good-byes to their families and others about them and gathered 
  behind, or rather inside the spiritual barriers that were erected around the 
  ceremonial grounds. These barriers, comprised of circular arbors, wooden structures 
  and imaginary lines, would divide sacred space from common space for the next 
  four days, and only those partaking in the rituals were permitted to cross them. 
  The sweat lodges were inside this space, and this evening, as it would be for 
  the next four days, the sweat ceremony was for the dancers alone. Special prayers 
  and preparations would be made this evening for the ordeals that lay ahead. 
  Night fell upon the desert, quiet descended and one by one the campfires and 
  lights went out...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"> Those who were awake with the dancers the next 
  morning, before the break of dawn, experienced another magical blessing from 
  the heavens. Arvol mentioned in his talk that afternoon that the Cloud people 
  had been attending the ceremonies. Looking around as he spoke one could see 
  them assembled everywhere above and around the circle. They were billowed up 
  against the blue sky like ancient elders sitting around the Throne of God, attentive 
  to the words, to Arvol's recognition of them, and to the prayers and chants 
  of the people. They had been gathering around the ceremonies in a very mystical 
  way for the previous several days. The people had been aware of them. Two days 
  earlier they had swept the desert with a drenching, cleansing rain, settling 
  the dust and sand, creating an aura of newness throughout the camp. Then as 
  the Tree was being cut in the canyon the next day, they had come in and formed 
  themselves in a great, dark mystical spiral pattern right over the ceremony. 
  And then came another outpouring of rain as the Tree was being decorated and 
  lifted into place. And now this morning, as the people awoke, above them in 
  the sky, bending out of the heavens and touching down right over the Sundance 
  grounds was a magnificent Double Rainbow. There was no mistaking the significance 
  of it all. The heavens were in attendance.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/DoubleRainBow.gif" width="527" height="350"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Several moments later the second bow appeared as vivid as 
  the first.</b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">The mind was further elevated (<i>caught up </i>as 
  the Hebrew scriptures say) as the Dance began that Thursday morning. Images 
  of the whole universe and the direct and solemn relationship between man and 
  God, heaven and earth, came into view. The pageant of sacred history itself 
  unfolded before one's eyes, spiritual emotions overflowed and tears erupted 
  at the sight of the dancers appearing from the arbor onto the Sundance ground. 
  The drum-singers filled the air with their enchanting rhythms, setting the pace 
  of the dancers' feet. Their wailing songs surrounded the circle like an invisible 
  prayer wheel, blending the individual thoughts and prayers of all the people 
  together into one harmonious whole...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/TohlakaiDrum.jpg" width="250" height="226"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b>&quot;... The round form of the drum represents the whole 
    universe, and its steady strong beat is the pulse, the heart, throbbing at 
    the center of the universe. It is the voice of Wakan-Tanka, and this sound 
    stirs us and helps us to understand the mystery and power of all things ...&quot;<br>
    -Black Elk<br>
    'The Sacred Pipe' by Joseph Epes Brown<br>
    </b> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"> The two elders, Paul Tohlakai and Dave Chief, 
  led the way, followed by Chief Lookinghorse towering above all the rest in his 
  regal headdress of Eagle feathers. Two lines of dancers appeared, the men first 
  and the women after them. (Mira Omerzel, from Slovenia, commented that spiritual 
  women never exhibit a strong need to be first. They know that the Universe itself 
  is feminine, and that the gateway into this world is always through the Feminine 
  Principle). </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">In rhythmic step (some in quarter-step and half-step) 
  the dancers followed each other around the circle, stopping to form a double-line 
  on the Western side of the Tree facing the Rising Sun. The dance had begun, 
  and for the next four days, each morning and after each rest period until Sundown, 
  the dancers would enter the circle this way, circumambulating clockwise around 
  the Sacred Tree, until they had stood during each session, in prayer and adoration 
  toward each of the Four directions. As the Hebrew priests were commanded to 
  wear bells on their garments, signaling they had entered the sacred precinct 
  with solemn intentions, so the participants in these rituals danced with small 
  reed-like pitch-pipes (bone whistles) in their mouths, intoning the Great Spirit 
  to recognize the ceremonies and the good intentions of their hearts. Likewise, 
  as Moses sanctified the Tent of the Congregation, sprinkling the blood of the 
  sacrifice seven times over the congregation and all the instruments of sacrifice, 
  the Lakota priest waved a fond of Eagle feathers over each of the dancers, over 
  each of the Four entrances leading into the circle, over all the ritual instruments, 
  over the Tree and over the grounds, sanctifying the entire area and all the 
  proceedings. Two imaginary lines were sent out from the Eastern gate to the 
  distant horizon, marking off the pathway the spirits used to enter the ceremony. 
  No one was to pass through these lines. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">The dancers continued throughout the day, following 
  the same rhythmic pattern, forming a circle and a square on the ground beneath 
  them around the Sacred Tree. The beautiful ceremonial skirts and dresses, the 
  front-cloths and shawls, headpieces and footwear that the dancers wore, added 
  to the mystique. Unlike the Rainbow Gathering in Michigan we had just attended, 
  where (an almost pagan) spirit of liberation filled the air, where clothing 
  was ceremoniously disregarded by many of the observants (<i>They were naked 
  and they were not ashamed</i>), the Sundance is held in a spirit of quiet, but 
  pervading modesty. Though the men dance shirtless, they are covered from the 
  waist down with ceremonial skirt and frontpiece. Some wore leggings and moccasins, 
  others danced barefooted. While the color that strikes the eye is red, broken 
  here and there by blue and white, one Mexican Indian man was dressed in a burlap 
  skirt and anklets, somehow suggestive of those who were brought to the altars 
  and offered in sacrifice to the Aztec gods before the Spaniards came (and then 
  later, as ceremoniously dispatched by musket and canon, and by plague and disease 
  to the Christian gods by the Spaniards themselves). The women dance fully clothed 
  (an equally tantric sight to behold), their colorful dresses and shawls embroidered 
  with mandalas, stars, and other individual symbols. Some wore necklaces and 
  bracelets of turquoise stones, beads and shells, suggestive of the skill and 
  craft indigenous peoples everywhere throughout the earth have mastered over 
  time, weaving and stringing their own natural existences into the greater design 
  of the Universe, and into the intricate pattern of the Circle of Life. Several 
  carried fans, cooling their fellow dancers from the heat of the Sun as the day 
  wore on. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">The dancers were brought by twos and threes throughout 
  the day to the entrance of the South gate by Paul, the Navajo chief and head 
  of the Sacred Mountains Sundance, to exchange words and prayers with different 
  women who were chosen from among the circle of observers and supporters, and 
  then to the center of the circle where each, in silent meditation, touched their 
  foreheads to the Sacred Tree before returning to their places in the line of 
  dancers. The movement suggested the connections every spiritual adept must establish 
  between themselves and the outside world, and the very act itself of bringing 
  the heartfelt prayers and petitions of the people before the Throne of Grace. 
  (We can see it in the pattern of the Temple plan that was handed down by God 
  to Moses on the mount). I gave my petitions to two of the dancers--one male 
  and other female--before they were sequestered inside the sacred precincts on 
  Wednesday evening. (I also tied eight small pieces of chord to one of the upper 
  branches of the Tree before it was raised, in order to think, not only <i>on 
  those things which are above</i> throughout the coming year, but as a prayer 
  for those things which are about to come).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Somewhere around the third or fourth session on 
  that opening day, the speaker announced that this would be <i>a piercing round</i>. 
  As the dancers appeared from beneath the arbor two men came forward (as others 
  would during the days to come) and were accompanied by the Navajo chief to the 
  center of the Circle. Suspended from the Sacred Tree were the ropes that each 
  had tied to it the day before, and from which the two would be suspended throughout 
  the daylight hours for the next three days. Others would follow them, day after 
  day, until the fourth day when all who would be pierced had come forward. The 
  chief made two sets of incisions in the chests of both, one set on the right 
  and the other on the left, through which were passed a wooden dowl or a claw, 
  or a hook, to which each rope would be looped and attached. As the dance continued, 
  with added resolve now, and a heightened sense of ceremony, the two, dancing 
  in place, moved away from the Tree until the weight of the extended lines began 
  to pull on the flesh. Over the next four days the dancers would add their own 
  weight, leaning taught on the lines as they danced, trancelike, eyes heavenward, 
  thoughts breaking and penetrating the boundaries between this world and the 
  Spirit world, carrying the prayers and petitions of the people across with them, 
  until finally tearing loose from the long ordeal on the last day, ritually, 
  as well as literally, shedding the blood of redemption for all the people. After 
  Sundown on the Fourth day the dancers returned to the familiar world of family 
  and friends, physical sustenance, and then after that to the routines of daily 
  life. Each would be honored now among those who know them, and hear of them, 
  and each would carry with them through life the unmistakable marks and scars 
  of those who have made an offering of themselves on the Sacred Tree. (I noticed 
  five sets of scars on one of the dancers, and I am sure there are others who 
  wear more than that). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The sacred Sundance ceremonies at Pinon were, indeed &quot;the 
  real thing.&quot; They may not have reached the frenzied intensity of past rituals 
  (as they have been portrayed in movies; and I am thankful that they were not 
  attended by a fierce hatred of whites as some dances in the past must have been), 
  but come very close, nevertheless, to the description of them in the book entitled: 
  <i>Lame Deer Seeker of Visions</i>, by John (Fire) Lame Deer and Richard Erdoes:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;So they made this dance, 
    and slowly, generation after generation, added more meaning to it, added to 
    its awesomeness. My father taught me, as he had been taught by his father, 
    the learning and teaching going back to the beginning of time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Wi wanyang wacipi</i>--the sun 
    dance--is our greatest feast which brings all the people together. I told 
    you of <i>hanblechia</i>, the vision quest, one man alone by himself on an 
    isolated hilltop, communicating with the mystery power. Well, the sun dance 
    is all the people communicating with all the mystery powers. It is the <i>hanblechia</i> 
    of the whole Sioux nation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sun dance is the most misunderstood 
    of all our rites. Many white men think of it as an initiation into manhood, 
    or a way to prove one's courage. But this is wrong. The sun dance is prayer 
    and sacrifice. One does not take part in it voluntarily but as the result 
    of a dream, or a vision.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sun dance you are about to 
    witness is sponsored by someone who dreamed that he must undergo this ordeal 
    to bring his son back from Vietnam, to bring peace to the people of this world 
    so that they can understand one another. We will dance for this.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dance is not so severe now 
    as it once was, but even today it asks much of a man. Even today a man may 
    faint for lack of food and water. He may become so thirsty blowing on his 
    eagle-bone whistle that his throat will be parched like a dry riverbed. He 
    may be blind for a time staring at the sun so that his eyes see only glowing 
    spirals of glaring whiteness. The pain in his flesh, where the eagle's claw 
    is fastened in his breast, may become so great that a moment arrives when 
    he will no longer feel it. It is at such moments, when he loses consciousness, 
    when the sun burns itself into his mind, when his strength is gone and his 
    legs buckle under him, that the visions occur--visions of becoming a medicine 
    man, visions of the future.&quot; <font size="2">pp.188,189.</font></font></p>

  was, again, more than memorable. For almost all it was a confirmation of the 
  sanctity of Life; for many it was a return to a place of power, to prayers that 
  were offered and committed to the branches of the Sacred Tree a year ago; for 
  others a journey to a fuller and clearer sense of one's place in the greater 
  pageant of history, and of those things that are unfolding in the world around 
  us in our time. The whole of it is a preparation for the realization of those 
  mysteries that were committed to this land and to the indigenous peoples of 
  this land not only centuries ago but millennia ago...</font></p>

    of prophecies were instilled in me by our Spiritual Elders of that time, concerning 
    drastic changes that would come to all life upon Mother Earth. These changes 
    are here with us today. I was told that a sign of these changes called the 
    crossroads would come to pass when the spirit of the White Buffalo Calf Woman 
    would once again stand upon Mother Earth, which I never believed that I would 
    witness. The first white buffalo was born in 1994 and since then eight more

    the connection to Mother Earth is now in the stages of dark times. The disease

    this kind monumental effort, along with prayers and belief to heal the Ozone 
    layer that is depleting every moment causing these drastic changes toward 
    all life, including the negative influences in our minds toward on another.</font></p>

    to take place. This year is a continuing journey of this important event on 
    June 21st, around the world to four continents of the four colors of relatives. 
    We have always represented these colors in our sacred ceremonies. We begin 
    this journey in Ireland and the following years of the June 21st ceremony 
    will be in Africa, Australia, and Japan then back to Turtle Island (Americas) 
    for a thank you ceremony. I pray that as we visit the different Nations on

  to the old Save Our Mountains Coalition spent an day in Charleston, West Virginia, 
  lobbying legislators, and that entire night outside on the capital steps, lifting 
  up our voices, and holding signs protesting strip mining. (Who had even thought 
  of such an atrocity as mountain top removal yet). We naively rejoiced as passing 
  motorists honked their horns and flashed their lights in support. Those were 
  hopeful times. The future state Attorney General brought us coffee and cakes 
  in the morning. U.S. Representative/future Secretary of State Ken Heckler joined 
  us in our efforts. We are all much older now and should be able to see that 
  these efforts hardly made any difference at all, and some of us can understand 
  why. We were trying to change the existing order of things, an order that is 
  completely impervious to life, and to the cries of life, which in turn, however, 
  had to come to its present state of darkness, so that it could be seen clearly 
  for what it is and so that we could begin to understand why we must separate 
  ourselves from it . It was not time yet. Only God can destroy what God has created 
  (Revelation 18). Only God can stop what God has allowed. Twenty eight years

  two of the organizers of the rally in Charleston, are courageously holding out 
  there against the entire coal industry, the state of West Virginia (whose governor

  are cunningly kept more concerned for their own personal and economic well-being 
  than they are for the life of the sacred mountains or the spiritual quality 
  of life for future generations. &quot;COME SEE WHAT'S LEFT OF THE LORD'S CREATION 
  AND CELEBRATE THE MOUNTAINS&quot; says the invitation. One has only to walk 
  the rest of the way up to the top of Kayford Mountain to see what's left, and 
  to behold what tremendous evil man is capable of. In every direction one witness 
  nothing but destruction and devastation...mountain tops denuded, stripped and

    While Thomas Jefferson </font>(recall the Lewis and Clark expedition)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    may be among the most famous, scores of notable thinkers, innovators, and 
    public servants trace there roots to these mountains. This spring the region 
    added another distinguished descendant to its roster when Virginia native 
    Holmes Rolston III received the prestigious Templeton Prize in honor of HIS 
    30 YEARS OF RESEARCH, WRITING, AND LECTURING ON THE RELIGIOUS IMPERATIVE TO 
    RESPECT NATURE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Templeton Prize for Progress 
    Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities...is valued at almost 
    $1.2 million and is the world's largest monetary annual award given to an

    to a living person to encourage and honor those who advance spiritual matters...A 
    self-described &quot;philosopher gone wild,&quot; 2003 Templeton Prize winner 
    Rolston's many works have essentially established THE FIELD OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
    ETHICS. Now a University Distinguished Professor at Colorado State and a Presbyterian 
    minister, Rolston is one of the world's leading advocates for protecting the 
    Earth's biodiversity and ecology in recognition of the intrinsic value of 
    creation. In philosophical circles, he is widely known as the &quot;father 
    of environmental ethics.&quot; In theological circles, he is known for his 
    concept of a sacred, prolific, yet &quot;cruciform&quot; creation...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Rolston, more than any other 
    living person, has been the seminal thinker who makes possible a new rapprochement 
    between biology and religion, joining theologians and biologists in their 
    common respect/reverence for nature. In the ancient Hebrew Scriptures, the 
    Hebrew people envisioned a promised land, flowing with milk and honey, but 
    if and only if they resided in that land WITH JUSTICE AND LOVE rolling down 
    like waters. Rolston has enlarged that vision a hundredfold, from locally 
    to globally, placing on the agenda for Earth in the new millennium the vision 
    of Earth as the promised planet.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his news conference remarks, 
    Rolston also cast the Earth's environmental needs IN TERMS OF JUSTICE. &quot;Our 
    planetary crisis is one of spiritual information: not so much sustainable 
    development, certainly not escalating consumption, BUT USING THE EARTH WITH 
    JUSTICE AND CHARITY. Science cannot take us there, religion perhaps can.&quot;

<p><font size="+1">The question, of course, is this (and please excuse our skepticism): 
  are these words, and is this an <i>ethic</i> and an agenda that the likes of 
  George Bush, Dick Cheney and Gail Norton could manipulate and endorse? Would 
  Professor Rolston also accept an invitation to the White House, and an award 
  from government and industry for his philosophical musings? Have the destructions 
  abated during his tenure? Or have the destroyers simply become more <i>ethical</i> 
  in their own <i>wise use</i> of the Earth?</font></p>

  president is indeed, truly concerned for the environment, but also for <i>their 
  jobs </i>(and this is the message that resonates...&quot;jobs&quot;), and is 
  doing all that he can to protect them both. Business and industry, of course, 
  are more than satisfied. They got the message, nothing has changed, it is business

<p align="center"><b>RELIGIOUS LEADERS READ FROM &quot;THE BOOK OF NATURE&quot;</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>For centuries, people of faith have turned to the wilderness as a place 
    of prayer and connection with the divine. In recent years there has been a 
    dramatic resurgence of interest in the natural world among many religious 
    groups. From the &quot;What Would Jesus Drive?&quot; campaign, which turned 
    attention to the pollution caused by our vehicles, to the efforts of the Catholic 
    Church to reduce the impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining, religious 
    organizations are actively working to protect the natural world.</b></p>
  <p><b>Many of these religious leaders gathered in western North Carolina in 
    May as part of &quot;Opening the Book of Nature&quot; (OBN). The OBN program 
    organizes retreats across the country that offer members of local congregations 
    the opportunity to spend a weekend in a remote setting to learn and discuss 
    the theological view of care for the environment, while also experiencing 
    and enjoying creation in a peaceful setting...</b></p>
  <p><b>A primary goal of the OBN program, as explained by workshop participants 
    Dean Ohlmann is to &quot;reintroduce the church to a concept that has been 
    lost: that God has given us two revelations. It goes way back to the founders 
    of the early church...that God teaches us through two books: the book of God's 
    word and the book of God's works. And since God is the author of both, there 
    should be harmony. </b></p>
  <p><b>Dean Ohlman believes that Christians need to be smarter about where they 
    get their information. &quot;If you allow industry, and industrial scientists, 
    and those who have a vested interest in taking the products of the natural 
    world and making money from them to tell you whether or not something is damaging 
    to the environment, that's nonsense,&quot; Says Ohlman. &quot;You need to 
    find the best and most honest authorities.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Robert Godfried has a simple message: BE OPEN TO NEW INFORMATION AND NEW 
    WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD AROUND YOU. &quot;I JUST ENCOURAGE ALL OF 
    US TO GO WITH OPENNESS AND A SENSE OF WONDER AT EVERYTHING GOD IS DOING, AND

<p><font size="+1">Emily Smith drove down from upstate New York and picked me 
  up in Huntington. It was my hope that a number of us could have made the journey 
  to the Sundance this year. Things fell apart, situations changed (almost all 
  of it to do with people's finances <i>and their jobs</i>--things that we must 
  be liberated from if we are to pursue truly spiritual and enlightened lives). 
  With a great sense of adventure the two of us set out, once again toward Indiana 
  and Frank and Sonja's house near Terra Haute where we would spend the night. 
  Emily had not gone this way before and was eager to visit the historical places 
  and the natural and sacred sites that we had charted in front of us, places 
  that I had already visited. Our pilgrimage would take us across Illinois to 
  the pyramid mounds at Cahokia (please see A Journey of Atonement), and across 
  the Mississippi to St. Louis...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I and a station wagon full of older grandchildren had visited 
  there only the week before, after it became apparent that the ones who had (fast 
  food) jobs would not be able to get the two weeks off that it would take to 
  get to the Sundance and back without <i>losing their jobs</i>. (Oh that work 
  ethic! Amalek is a powerful adversary). They could only get four days off, so 
  we made the best of them and made a first-stages journey. On our way back we 
  spent the night at Paul Salstrom's house at St. Mary of the Woods, Indiana...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/MaryOfTheWoods.gif" width="244" height="376"></p>
<p align="center"><b>St. Mary of the Woods</b></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Paul is a history professor at the Catholic College there, 
  and took all of us over to the campus that evening to visit the Mediterranean-style 
  cathedral (think of old Mexico) and to walk the newly constructed labyrinth. 
  Where does it lead? To Jerusalem of course. All roads lead to the center, to 
  Jerusalem. (Please see The Labyrinth and Jerusalem). Fourteen year-old Jacob 
  led us in a half-playful half-serious prayer around the bimah in the cathedral 
  (perhaps his true spiritual self was trying to surface), and all of us, in the 
  company of some Catholic sisters, solemnly and quietly walked every step of 
  the labyrinth, both to the center and then back out again. One must always return 
  from a spiritual journey, ready to show others the way.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Labyrinthh2.jpg" width="250" height="248"></p>
<p><font size="+1">Paul spent three years or more in a Federal prison for his 
  refusal to serve in the Vietnam War. He was a hero to many of us who knew him, 
  and who first met him back then. He went on a peace-walk across the country. 
  In Huntington he and Mimi Ralston published a periodical called <i>The Green 
  Revolution </i>(not to be confused with the government and agribusiness program 
  of the same name). These were the heady counter-cultural days, a back-to-the-land 
  movement was in full flower. Paul and others, having come over from the School 
  of Living in Maryland, found there way by articles in Mother Earth, and by word 
  of mouth, to the growing community at Myra, in Lincoln County. (The community 
  has all but disappeared now). A practicing Quaker when I met him (he still lives 
  a quiet monastic life), he was also initially responsible for opening up the 
  realization for me that Buddhism and Christianity were wholly compatible and 
  complimentary paths. Paul believed that change was possible then, as did so 
  many others, and that an enlightened human spirit was capable in itself of initiating 
  those changes...I think Paul has abandoned these <i>humanistic </i>notions, 
  but along with them any immediate sense that change is coming at all, and has 
  retreated instead to his articles and books, and his favorite subject, Appalachian 
  Studies. My dear friend Paul has an Augustinian view of the world (the kingdom 
  of God will come someday, maybe someday, out there at some future time, but 
  not in our time). He is a scholastic, not an apocalyptic. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">From St. Louis, Emily and I traveled northwestward along the 
  Missouri River toward Nebraska, and from these great grasslands onto the Rosebud 
  Reservation in South Dakota. We visited the museum and church at St. Francis, 
  and went from there to Wounded Knee. Emily was deeply touched there, both culturally 
  and spiritually. She made a connection with history during her walk around that 
  historic site and our conversation with Gerald Elk. Gerald is a local historian 
  and opened the pages of the books and records he had with him. We sat next to 
  him as he lined out the events of the 1890 massacre for us, pointing to the 
  places where Big Foot was shot and lay frozen on the ground, and where the others, 
  including the women and children, were mowed down and left to die along the 
  creek beds and ditches leading away from the hill where the tragic events began. 
  He accompanied our thoughts from those events to the takeover of Wounded Knee 
  in 1973, when a group of traditionalists staged what some have called the truly 
  last resistance of Indigenous Nations on this continent against the conquering 
  Americans. He spoke of how local Indian authorities tried to erase signs of 
  this resistance by recently bulldozing and filling in the church basement that 
  was left adjacent to the cemetery after the church itself burned down. The resisters 
  held up in this church while the standoff between themselves and the government 
  unfolded. He spoke of the many reasons for this resistance, and also how his 
  people's health has been destroyed by the white man's commodities. We suffer 
  from alcoholism and diabetes he said, and from poverty of mind and spirit. We 
  told him that we were on our way to the Sundance at Pinon, where the Lakota 
  Chief, Arvol Lookinghorse was presiding. &quot;Arvol Lookinghorse,&quot; he 
  said, &quot;is a great man.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Emily remained alone with her own thoughts as we drove toward 
  the Badlands, in silent reflection, tears welling up in her eyes as she opened 
  up and touched that part of her own soul that understood all of this, and that 
  was actually a part of all of this. It was evening when we arrived at Bear Butte. 
  Do you see her? I asked. We (Bernard and Sirin and myself) were instructed to 
  look for her on a previous visit to this sacred mountain. &quot;Who?&quot; Emily 
  asked. Earth Mother giving birth to the world...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/BearButte.gif" width="595" height="336"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Divine Mother Earth, giving birth to the world.</b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">&quot;I see her!&quot; Emily exclaimed. By the 
  time we reached the summit the sun had just set, leaving behind it a brilliant 
  array of colors spread across the Western sky, and above a bright nearly-full 
  Moon to watch over us and attend our prayers. We went to the extreme Western 
  slope of the mountain to give thanks and to pray for the birth of the world. 
  We brought gifts with us and layed them on the ground, small shells and beads 
  that we hoped to give to others when we arrived at the Sundance two days hence. 
  When we arrived at Pinon we learned that Caroline and Paul Tohlakai were expecting 
  a child within a month or so. And at the Blessing Ceremony for expecting mothers 
  on the last day of the Dance three women, including Arvol's wife Paula, came 
  to the Sacred Tree at the center of the Circle. We thought of all the children 
  who are arriving in the world at this time--all the messiahs who are coming 
  to help the Creator turn the Great Wheel. Emily had touched the Seventh Heaven, 
  if only briefly, and carried a great sense of the Divine with her as we descended 
  the mountain that night. We continued our journey southward through the sacred 
  Black Hills (with a note of sorrow for the decadence and unmindfulness of the 
  times that we witnessed at Deadwood), woke up in Wyoming, bathed in the cold 
  rushing water of Sybille Creek, and found our way into Colorado before noon 
  that day.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Colorado, needless to say, is beautiful and majestic. 
  We stayed clear of the Interstates and the roads that lead through Denver, and 
  headed for those routes that cut themselves straight through the heart of the 
  state. There were tourists and play-vacationers everywhere, and so were we...or 
  rather probably would be if life for us was otherwise and we could afford it. 
  (I think I would skip the skiing though, and content myself with hiking and 
  camping. I have never been to Disney World. It has to do with the ubiquitous 
  and insidious cartoon culture that Americans have allowed themselves to become. 
  Right Mindfulness is one of the Eight Sacred Precepts. The American people do 
  not subscribe to them. They are suffering, instead, from a demonic need to be 
  constantly entertained and a-mused. (I must admit, however, that I have ridden 
  a roller coaster or two in my lifetime, but not the latest and the greatest). 
  Americans are at the eve of destruction and they are still playing. We pilgrims 
  discovered our way through the soul-inspiring San Juan and Sangre de Cristo 
  mountains, and then westward towards the Four Corners area and our final destination, 
  the Sacred Mountains Sundance at Pinon, Arizona.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">We arrived at the Sundance grounds the next morning. 
  The week's work was already in progress. We introduced ourselves to Paul and 
  Caroline and the others who were there early, and found ways to fit into everyone's 
  routines. The preparations were much like the previous year's, some new projects 
  were underway, but the spiritual energy was the same. Tolerance, love and respect 
  was still the rule. For three days, until others arrived and the main kitchen 
  was repaired, Caroline (eight months with child) kept everyone nourished both 
  body and soul under her tent, and around her table. People would come and go 
  from their regular duties and join the others at Caroline's communal kitchen 
  throughout the day, and pitch in with the cooking and cleaning up each evening. 
  Carry and Victoria were there from Pa., Lynn and Kathleen from Mass. Trilight 
  was there, keeping everyone in abstract fits of laughter. Bob Doyle, a lawyer-advocate 
  for indigenous causes, was a comforting figure throughout the week. He shared 
  a book of his poems with me. In it he wrote: &quot;To Michael, We gather more 
  than sage.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="+1">Annami was there from Belgium. What heart! What 
  spirit! What joy! Her daughter Aileen will hopefully return with her next year. 
  (Of course the world could be in dire crisis by then, making travel for some 
  impossible). Pam went back and forth, this year as last, between her responsibilities 
  at the Fire circle, the kitchen and her other duties, always busy, and always 
  singularly mindful of the way things are supposed to be done. Matthew Crowley 
  (Crow Lee), on his way to a Spirit Fire festival, spent the entire week in service 
  to the Sundance and the work at hand. Hage, who flew in from South America, 
  as did Yanis from Slovenia, tirelessly assisted Ron the head Fire Keeper throughout 
  the week. All of these, from the early morning hours till late at night, were 
  there selflessly laboring to assure that the stones of fire were always ready 
  for the sweat lodges (the purification ceremonies) that were attended by the 
  sundancers at the beginning and the end of every day. Gail was there with her 
  beautifully troubled heart and her healing touch.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">And who can fail to think of the Begay family 
  and the other local and indigenous people who seemed to be everywhere, directing 
  the work, doing the work, tying up all the loose ends, making things work. Edgar 
  and Georgette and their family were there from the Farm in Massachusetts, lovingly 
  mixing mortar and laying block, building a utility shed to house the generator. 
  Mike, the chiropractor from California, as humbly adept at setting a cedarpole 
  as straightening a vertebrae, and the others who provided hours of labor, Chris 
  Lindstrom, David, Michael, Bo, Joseph, Dennis and all the other dancers and 
  helpers who were there, and who came in over the several days leading up to 
  the ceremonies, all of them gave completely of themselves. And the children, 
  they provided the joyful noise, and almost the entire reason for it all. Emily 
  began helping in the kitchen, and filling in wherever she was asked to, but 
  followed her preferences as she could for the digging, the hammering and the 
  outside work. It does indeed take an entire village.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">We make mention of these things because it is 
  the same kind of energy and devotion that will be required of the thousands 
  who will gather together at the Center around the Great Tree, as the impending 
  economic, social and spiritual crises intensify in this country and as that 
  which is laboring to be born in the world is finally born. Hideaki Masago came 
  all the way from Japan. With his kind and loving permission, we have included 
  one of his drawings at the beginning of this chapter. His music is mystical 
  and enchanting. It touches the heart and informs the soul. He gave us three 
  of his own works to take home with us as gifts: <i>Native Land, A Chaco Journey; 
  Great Mystery</i> and <i>Planet Love</i>. (www.awa-muse.com). He sent the words 
  of a song that is sung each year by thousands in Japan:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/SakuraSakura.gif" width="478" height="153"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Arvol Lookinghorse and his family arrived on the 
  third day. A campsite was already prepared for them and for Dave Chief who is 
  a devoted friend of the revered Lakota Chief and serves as <i>priest </i>during 
  the sacred ceremonies. One would have to say that Paul Tohlakai is the High 
  Priest, and the spiritual head of the Sacred Mountain Sundance, but neither 
  of these three would ever concern themselves with such titles and descriptions. 
  They are analogies that I have imposed, seeing the direct connections that exist 
  between these ceremonies and the sacred Hebrew mysteries. What one can immediately 
  sense, however, is that these three (along with those who are near to them in 
  these ceremonies) are very close to the heart of the Creator. Each possesses 
  an immense amount of spiritual integrity, as do all the other individuals who 
  attended the ceremonies. One can trust their ways and is safe in their teachings. 
  They bring the soul back to the ways of God.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Chief Lookinghorse said that a true spiritual 
  warrior had no need at any time for any weapon but Truth and Love for the people. 
  Nor must anyone ever use their words to humiliate or embarrass others, or to 
  put ourselves above the people. Dave Chief said that one must always keep their 
  word, and fulfill the vows and promises they have made to the Creator and to 
  others. Paul Tohlakai said that all things must always be done in a good way, 
  with all things in mind. These were among the many others teachings that everyone 
  received, both around the circle and in the lodges. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">The sweat lodges are almost the perfect place 
  to begin (or perhaps to complete) the journey of spiritual purification. For 
  the first three days (mornings and evenings) all are invited to partake in them. 
  (During the last four days the lodges are attended by the Sundancers alone). 
  Everyone has their own personal reasons for entering the sweat lodge, and most 
  assuredly emerge with their very own sense of having endured an ordeal, and 
  perhaps of having made a breakthrough into that place in their own heart and 
  soul where the Divine itself resides. The lodge is all that has been said about 
  it, and so much more. It is a trial of Fire (molten rock and intense heat). 
  It is cleansing. It is cathartic. It is healing. It is death and resurrection. 
  It is a return to the womb. For those who enter with the right spiritual intentions, 
  it is rebirth.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">On the first night, as Emily entered the women's 
  lodge, I went to the lodge presided over by an experienced Sundancer named Dennis, 
  a native man from San Diego. Dennis is a social worker among indigenous youth 
  in that area. At Pinon he dances directly behind the three elders, and is a 
  source of great encouragement and instruction to those who are dancing for the 
  first times in their life. No one in the Indigenous Community need worry that 
  the traditions are being watered down for tourists here. Whoa Ho! HO! Wah HO! 
  I had learned from my few previous experiences in the lodge to center myself 
  in the realization that this ordeal (like the ordeals of Life itself) would 
  soon pass, and that before the night was over I would be standing once again 
  under the canopy of God's Greater Lodge, under the starlit sky, breathing once 
  again the cool refreshing air--in this case (the Prana) of God's beautiful Arizona 
  desert. And so it did. &quot;Thank you Dennis, Thank you Creator.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">The women's lodge let out soon afterwards (Theirs 
  is almost always longer each evening than the men's lodges, and perhaps it is 
  because our mothers and sisters share more of themselves with each other, and 
  have more to sing and pray about. It is a great blessing and an immense comfort, 
  however, to come out first, and to have the opportunity to sit and listen to 
  the songs that are still emanating from the women's lodge, to sense the enduring 
  power and the magic of the Feminine principle, and the sacred balance that exists 
  everywhere in the universe. I am certain, of course, that the women find equal 
  comfort in the songs that also emanate from the men's lodges, and for all the 
  same reasons). Emily appeared from among the women, and found her way to the 
  nearby benches. I left her alone with her own thoughts. Perhaps fifteen minutes 
  went by before I asked her how it was. &quot;There are no words to describe 
  the experience...It was just wonderful,&quot; she said. Emily was connecting 
  to the mysteries of Creation. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Dennis told us as we were leaving the lodge the 
  first night that this was only <i>a taste</i> <i>of things to come</i>. For 
  some the purification rites must be first and foremost a physical ordeal. But 
  as one gets older the focus shifts. (Of course the flesh is always in the way, 
  but it is the mind that needs to be reconciled). The following evening as we 
  lined up to attend the lodges, one had a choice to follow Dennis and others 
  into that lodge, or to enter the lodge that the much older Dave Chief was presiding 
  over. I reasoned to myself that I had already endured the one, and that it was 
  not my body but my mind that I was trying to burn up. Dave Chief speaks long, 
  but his words are wise. Thus I reasoned that his lodge would be a longer ordeal 
  but perhaps not as physically excruciating, after all, the two of us were greyheads 
  and there were certain things, I reasoned to myself, that surely we no longer 
  had to prove to ourselves. The equation was correct, and the choice a great 
  blessing. The door shut, the songs and prayers began, the drum joined in, the 
  heat intensified, the sweat poured...but then the heat subsided, and the Chief's 
  attention turned from ordeal to words. He spoke of divine things, of spiritual 
  matters, of sacred precepts. The first session ended with a song, in a crescendo 
  of wailing chants, pounding drum, and the cry went out, <i><font size="+1">&quot;MITAKUYE 
  OYASIN&quot; </font></i><font size="+1">(All My Relations)! This was the signal 
  for the outside attendants to open the door of the lodge. (Very prophetic). 
  </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">More stones were brought in, the flaps closed, 
  and the second session began as the first. Again Dave Chief brought the heat 
  inside to a pitch, and again allowed it to subside. Then the old priest did 
  something that was extremely significant (at least to me). He continued the 
  remainder of the session with the door of the lodge opened. He let the light 
  and the fresh air in to accompany the teachings and the instructions that followed. 
  Then he invited each of the men in the lodge to share their own words, their 
  prayers or a song, with all the others. And so it began, in a circle from the 
  first to the last. I have been to several old-time Appalachian prayer meetings, 
  and the testimonies, and the prayers poured out in those meetings were never 
  more sincere, or moving, as the testimonies and the prayers that were made in 
  the lodge that evening. The men spoke of serious spiritual matters, of their 
  own personal afflictions, of loved ones lost and family members gone astray, 
  of entire communities in disarray. Hearts were touched, tears were shed. It 
  was an intense communal experience. By the time the words passed to me it seemed 
  that all the thoughts of my heart (of my own afflictions) had already been so 
  prayerfully expressed. What came to mind then was the sense of history that 
  was unfolding here: &quot;My (name-sake) people (the ancient Irish) lived on 
  the other side of the great Sea. There was a time when we also knew the way 
  to the sacred Tree of Life, and shared like ceremonies, and were, likewise, 
  indigenous to the land we lived on. But that was long ago. In time we were driven 
  off the land by others, and also found ourselves oppressed and dispossessed. 
  When the way was opened, and the opportunity arrived, we came across the sea 
  to this land. We came, however, with a sickness in our hearts and bitterness 
  in our soul. When we got here it was with the unholy notion that we could make 
  up for what we lost in one land by stealing it back in another, and from another 
  people. Our religion failed us (as we failed ourselves). We were sold not only 
  into the hands of our oppressors but we adopted their ways as well.&quot; I 
  thanked everyone in the lodge for keeping these mysteries intact, and for helping 
  make it possible for others of us to find our way back to them, back to the 
  pathway of the Sun and to the Root of the Sacred Tree. Dave Chief had the sacred 
  pipe brought into the lodge. As the smoke ascended, and as the pipe was passed 
  from soul to soul, the songs, the teachings and the prayers of each of the men, 
  were all bound together and offered as one to the Great Creator.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Tree Day was a solemn and ceremonial day, mixed 
  with the same collective and joyous sense of orderly confusion and chaos as 
  previous years. The Tree itself required some extra effort to bring out of its 
  place in the canyon woods. As all things would have it though, by the time the 
  tree was tied to the flatbed truck--after all the branches that snapped on their 
  own, and the others that were purposely cut to get it through the thicket--and 
  carried to the sundance grounds, it arrived in perfect form. When it was finally 
  raised and set in place, there it stood with two main branches raised heavenward, 
  a perfect image of the principles of balance that govern the universe. It stood 
  there against the evening sky, decorated with the prayers and offerings of the 
  people for the coming year...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="+1">(There are criticisms of this and other Sundance 
  ceremonies across the country, from inside the Native American community itself. 
  Besides the charges surrounding the Big Mountain Sundance ceremonies (which 
  have now moved to another nearby location on Navajo land), other complaints 
  from the Four Corners area are that these ceremonies are not indigenous to the 
  Navajo and Hopi peoples, and have no meaningful place among them. And in their 
  being opened to non-Indians they signal a more dangerous and far-reaching movement 
  away from Native American spirituality itself:</font><br>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lakota spirituality 
  is the one thing that must not be stolen<br>
  By Tim Giago (Nanwica Kciji)</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems to me that the spirituality 
    (religion) of so many Indian tribes has become diluted by overexposure and 
    by flagrant abuse by wannabes, false shamans and New Agers. There is also 
    the problem of one tribe after another adopting the ceremonial practices of 
    other tribes. One of the most sacred ceremonies of the Lakota and other tribes 
    of the Northern Plains is the Sundance. The Navajo are now conducting a Sundance 
    at Big Mountain, a section of land once held by the Navajo that was partitioned 
    by the federal government and returned to the Hopi Nation.The Sundance was 
    never a Navajo ceremony. Why they would want to usurp and claim one of the 
    most sacred ceremonies of the tribes of the Northern Plains is puzzling.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the abuse of the Sundance 
    began amongst the Sioux people themselves when some Lakota, claiming to be 
    medicine men, opened up the ceremony to outsiders, mostly non-Indians and 
    started to charge money to the attendees.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A true Sundance is held in private 
    for tribal members only. No non-Indians or non-members are permitted to attend. 
    The Sundance held at Porcupine on the Pine Ridge Reservation and conducted 
    by Rick Two Dogs, a most respected spiritual leader, is closed to the public. 
    Armed guards are posted at the only entrance to the Sundance Grounds and each 
    individual entering the Grounds must produce evidence of identity. There are 
    no exceptions. If you are not a member of the tribe you are turned away. There 
    are also no charges.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same can be said of the most 
    guarded ceremonies of some of the Pueblo people of New Mexico and the Hopi 
    of Arizona. Perhaps these tribes may put on a show of a ceremony for the general 
    public during the tourist season, but the true and sacred ceremonies are always 
    held in secret, outside of the prying eyes of the non-member and non-Indian.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many Indians who do not 
    like to see public displays of their spirituality. I always use 'spirituality' 
    to describe the sacred rites of an Indian tribe because to use the word 'religion' 
    would not be correct. A religion is structured as an organized faith that 
    is practiced within the pages of a written document such as a Bible or Quran. 
    The 'spirituality' of the Indian nations is one of absolute freedom that has 
    no dogmatic guidelines.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By public display I mean those 
    times when the prayers of the Indian spiritual leader are performed in front 
    of a mixed audience. Other Indians have told me that they are embarrassed 
    when a spiritual leader prays in his or her own language to an audience of 
    non-Indians incapable of understanding what he is saying. For the most part 
    the audience stands in reverence with heads bowed and hands clasped in front 
    of them. In the old days the Lakota never stood with head bowed when they 
    prayed. The stood with arms outstretched and heads held high as they prayed 
    to the sky where Wakan Tanka (Great Spirit) dwelled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems that Indians cannot have 
    a convention without calling upon a local medicine man to say a prayer in 
    a language none of them understand. The prayer is always said from the rostrum 
    before the start of the convention. Sometimes the prayer is longer than the 
    keynote address that is about to follow. This causes the non-Indian audience 
    to shift from foot to foot in an effort to remain respectful. I've even heard 
    non-Indian audiences applaud after the medicineman completes his prayer.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jolly good show, old bean! And 
    that is what it turns out to be oftentimes, just a good show for an audience 
    wanting to have 'Indian experience.'The next convention I stage will be held 
    differently. I will ask that the Indian people gather in a private place where 
    they can share a prayer with a Holy Man prior to going to the convention floor. 
    In this way our spirituality is kept to ourselves and not put on public display.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are those elders who are 
    bothered by all of this public display of spirituality also. I have heard 
    them say, 'The white man took everything that once belonged to us and now 
    they want to take our spirituality.' Of course, this is always followed by, 
    'This is the one thing we have left and it is the one thing that we must keep 
    for ourselves only.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a way, I feel sorry for those 
    Indian people who have embraced the religion of the invaders. How can they 
    worship a God that was brought over from another world? There are those who 
    say we all worship the same God so what difference does it make what our religion 
    is? I believe an impartial observer of the Hindu, Muslim, Jew, and Christian 
    would find that hard to swallow. If they worship the same God then why are 
    they killing each other because of their religious differences? Embracing 
    the religion of the white man did not save the lives of those Indians slaughtered 
    in the name of the new God they had just embraced.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The spirituality of the Indian 
    people should once more be taken to a secret place. There should be no more 
    of this 'Indians on parade' mentality to start a convention. If the true spirituality 
    of the Lakota, Hopi, Pueblo, Blackfeet, Crow, Navajo, Inupiat or of any other 
    Indian nation of the Western Hemisphere is to mean anything to the Indian 
    people themselves, it must be taken back from those who stole it, abused it, 
    and made fun of it. Indian spirituality is not a commodity that can be bought 
    or sold. It is not something that can be brought out into the light like a 
    flag only when it needs to be waved. Nor is it something that can be imitated 
    by pretenders. It is something that is deep, profound, sensual, mysterious, 
    ancient and unfathomable. It is the one thing we still own that cannot be 
    given away, shared, or taken from us. Once our spirituality is gone, we no 
    longer exist as a distinct people.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My father, Stanley Looking Horse, 
    journeyed with our family almost every year to honour the Sacred Sites. I 
    remember once, when I was twelve, visiting the Sacred Site of Standing Rock, 
    which is located in the center of the Fort Yates community. I remember all 
    the cars driving by with their drivers peering out at us in curiosity, wondering 
    what we were doing there. My father was filling his C' anupa (a Sacred Pipe) 
    and I was smudging with sage and helping prepare for the ceremony. It made 
    me feel uneasy at the time, as many of our ways were outlawed back then, but 
    I knew I had to be strong, because I had a responsibility and respect for 
    ceremonies. Some of us have no choice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back then very few people kept 
    the ceremonies, as they were hidden and forbidden, so we had to post security 
    because it was as viewed illegal. We didn't gain our religious rites until 
    the Freedom of Religion Act was passed by congress in 1978. We had to prepare 
    very carefully before the ceremonies would happen; the protocols were very 
    strict with our Elders back then. I remember people, mostly Elders, coming 
    for ceremony and camping for four days prior to ceremony. From them, I learned 
    the meanings of the sacredness of the number Four, and why we open our hands 
    up Four times to accept the C'nupa, the Sacred Pipe--each movement a sign 
    of acceptance and understanding of the full meaning of Mitakuye Oyasin (All 
    My Relations)...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of these memories, my work 
    toward understanding Peace and Prayer has taken many different forms. I never 
    knew where the responsibility would lead, not just with my own people, but 
    with the Global Community at large, to whom I have been directed to reach 
    out, as I am doing today--with that understanding that this journey is still 
    directly on behalf of the survival of my own People.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Lakota, Dakota &amp; 
    Nakota Star Knowledge, June 21st was one of the times that our Ancestors knew 
    as a day to unite and pray. It was known that the spiritual energy at that 
    time of Summer Solstice flowed through an open door from the Creator...</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For thousands of years our Ancestors 
    have celebrated the Summer Solstice as a time to honour and become One with 
    all life on this Sacred Mother Earth, giving thanks and bringing Peace and 
    Harmony to All our Relations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the occasion of this Sixth Annual 
    World peace &amp; Prayer Day...we invite members of the Global Community to 
    join us in creating local Peace and Prayer Day gatherings at their own sacred 
    sites and places around the world, and continue in the years ahead to bring 
    this act of Global Healing to All peoples and Nations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am not saying to walk exactly 
    as we walk in our culture, or to hold ceremonies exactly as we hold them. 
    I encourage the Nations to pray in their own ways, and to revive their own 
    ancient traditions of love and respect, which are the foundation stones of 
    All Indigenous cultures. </font>Compiled and arranged by Harvey Arden and
