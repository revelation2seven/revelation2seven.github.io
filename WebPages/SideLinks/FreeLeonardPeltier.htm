<p>Message of Thanks to Leonard Peltier and the LPDC from Mumia Abu Jamal. January 
  21, 1999</p>
<p>Ona Move! We, all of us, give solid thanks to Leonard Peltier and his numerous 
  supporters worldwide, for the principled assistance in France recently. I deeply 
  appreciate it - we ALL do. </p>
<p>Many years ago, when I was doing radio commentary for several Philadelphia 
  college stations, I frequently received taped reports from communications people 
  from AIM (American Indian Movement ), and promptly reported such information 
  to my audience. What I learned was that the U.S. government was waging a vicious 
  and unrelenting war against native people. In (It) was a phase in that war that 
  an innocent Lakota activist, Leonard Peltier was dogged by this government, 
  and framed for murder. </p>
<p>For almost a quarter of a century, this kind and gentle warrior, this artist, 
  this son of his people, has withstood the brutal assaults of the U.S. government, 
  against its own &quot;law,&quot; its own constitution, its own precedent. On 
  February 6, 1999 the calendar will strike 23 long and lonely years in U.S. gulags 
  for Leonard Peltier. Twenty-three years since an overtly illegal extradition 
  from Canada to the U.S. Twenty-three years in a Yankee Iron Cage for the &quot;crime&quot; 
  of resisting American repression. </p>
<p><b>As we enter a new century, it is past time for us to correct this vile injustice 
  against Leonard Peltier. Let a new century begin with an act of justice for 
  the Oglola people. </b></p>

  <b>LEONARD PELTIER'S APPEAL DENIED</b> </p>
<p align="center"><b>By Arthur J. Miller</b></p>
<p><b>Tacoma-lpsg@ojibwe.us</b> </p>
<p><b>Once again the courts have closed the door to justice and the truth</b>. 
  The U.S. Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit, on Nov. 4, 2003, issued their ruling 
  denying Leonard Peltier's appeal. The conclusion of the ruling by the court 
  states: &quot;Much of the government's behavior at the Pine Ridge Reservation 
  and in its prosecution of Mr. Peltier is to be condemned. The government withheld 
  evidence. It intimidated witnesses. These facts are not disputed. Mr. Peltier 
  asserts that &quot;the blatant government misconduct! is a mitigating factor 
  which should bear strongly on whether (he) should be immediately considered 
  for parole&#133;.&quot; He may be correct. But whether the Parole Commission 
  gave proper weight to this mitigating evidence is not a question we have authority 
  to review. Our only inquiry is whether the Commission was rational in concluding 
  Mr. Peltier participated in the execution of the two federal agents. On the 
  record before us, we cannot say this determination was arbitrary and capricious.&quot;</p>
<p>A very interesting statement. The Parole Commission based its decision upon 
  a trial where evidence that Leonard could have used to prove his innocence was 
  withheld and part of what was used to convict Leonard was testimony by witnesses 
  intimidated by the FBI and the court admits this as fact. The court also in 
  its ruling stated that &quot;the Commission's description of the firefight as 
  an &quot;ambush&quot; was imprecise: there is no indication any of the participants 
  were lying in wait for the agents.&quot; An! d the court admits: &quot;In 1975, 
  the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota was embroiled in conflict 
  between traditional elders, who sought independence from Bureau of Indian Affairs 
  (BIA) managers, and Native Americans supportive of the BIA power structure. 
  The conflict became violent, and the traditional elders sought protection from 
  members of the American Indian Movement (AIM). Mr. Peltier and other AIM activists 
  arrived at Pine Ridge to defend reservation traditionalists.&quot;</p>
<p>So the court acknowledges the reason why Leonard was there, it acknowledges 
  that the government behavior at Pine Ridge, which was to side against the traditionalist, 
  is to be condemned. It acknowledges the violence, over 60 traditionalists had 
  been murdered, many victims of drive by shootings. The first two AIM members 
  who went on trial were found not guilty for reason of self-defense. But the 
  court states that the Parole Commission' s denial of parole for Leonard, which 
  was based upon things that the court states should be condemned, was not &quot;arbitrary 
  and capricious.&quot; Again the courts have shown, that in the case of Leonard 
  Peltier, such things as justice and common sense do not apply.</p>
<p>Like in the past when Leonard lost appeals, was not granted clemency and not 
  paroled, there are those that want to give up because Leonard will never find 
  justice in a system that only acts in its own interest even when its actions 
  stand against any sense of justice and even violates its own laws. Though it 
  is clear that the system will not grant justice to Leonard, but we should not 
  give up. For what will grant justice to Leonard is if enough people demand it 
  and how the government then decides to free Leonard is up to it. Rather than 
  give into the government and the system of injustice, we ! should use each and 
  every act by the government and its courts as further example of the rightness 
  of our cause and struggle even harder. I know that it is hard to continue this 
  struggle; I have been actively continuously working for Leonard for 24 years. 
  I have gone through all the appeals and felt the great sorrow and frustration 
  that each step has brought us. But we cannot surrender in the face of such oppression, 
  for the sake of Leonard we cannot surrender and for the sake of all who resist 
  this system that works in the interest of a few at the expense of the many.</p>

  Subject: Albuquerque Journal Letter To the Editor (Peltier)</p>
<p>Well folks, I had to write a response to the Presidential Candidates Woo Indian 
  Vote article in the Albuquerque Journal. I would suggest that some of you do 
  the same by clicking on the link below. http://www.abqjournal.com/letters_form.htm</p>
<p>Now lets see if this appears. Thats why I would request others to write a letter 
  to the Editor on this matter. Lets let our voices heard. John G</p>
<p></p>
<p>Would be Presidents courted the Indian vote in Albuquerque, but there was no 
  mention if they would grant American Indian Movement activist Leonard Peltier 
  clemency, who has served 27 years thus far for allegedly shooting 2 FBI agents 
  in Oglala, SD in 1975. Former President Clinton promised to review clemency 
  for Mr. Peltier in his eight year in office. He did not grant Mr. Peltier clemency, 
  but granted clemency to Marc Rich who was guilty of the biggest tax evasion 
  in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Picture this Mr. Presidential candidates. Picture yourself as a judge. The 
  proscecutor states that we don't know who shot our agents. It is known that 
  the proscecution withheld evidence to the defense, that two co-defendants were 
  found NOT GUILTY on the grounds of self defense, and that FBI files eleased 
  through the Freedom Of Information ACT revealed that a firing pin test resulted 
  in NO match between Mr. Peltier's AR-15 rifle and shell casings found near the 
  slain agents despite the fact that a ballistics expert testified to a jury that 
  there was a match between the casings and the AR-15 rifle.</p>
<p>Wouldn't you say he deserves a new trial? Well, the eighth circuit court of 
  appeals said NO. In fact, the parole commission can go beyond their guidelines 
  in denying him parole, even though he's long overdue. If Mr. Peltier's civil 
  rights can be violated, what does that say for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Thus far, only Carol Moseley Braun said yes to clemency for Mr. Peltier. You 
  Presidential candidates want to apologize to Native Americans, pardon Leonard 
  Peltier. Otherwise your apology doesn't hold water.</p>

  Subject: Albuquerque Journal: Presidential Candidates Woo Indians <br>
  By Leslie Linthicum Journal Staff Writer <br>
</p>
<p>Would-be presidents courted the Indian vote in Albuquerque on Monday, vowing 
  in person, by satellite and videotape to right old <br>
  wrongs. Retired Gen. Wesley Clark used the word &quot;genocide&quot; to describe 
  what the conquering second Americans did to the American Indians. Rep. Dennis 
  Kucinich bemoaned broken treaties and said that, as president, he would apologize 
  to Indian people for what the government has done to them. Sen. Joe Lieberman 
  said he would settle up the Indian trust account discrepancy. Sen. John Kerry 
  said he would pour money into Indian health care. And Rep. Dick Gephardt promised 
  to fill federal judgeships with American Indians. <br>
</p>
<p>The National Congress of American Indians, which is holding its annual session 
  in Albuquerque, is hosting six of the nine candidates vying for the Democratic 
  nomination for president. Clark and Kucinich came to the convention in person. 
  Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean is scheduled to attend Wednesday. Lieberman 
  and Gephardt sent taped remarks Monday and Kerry appeared live via satellite. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>They all used the word &quot;sovereignty,&quot; which, when you're trying to 
  woo the votes of American Indians, is something like saying, &quot;You have 
  beautiful eyes.&quot; &quot;When you say stuff like that, wow, you get Indians' 
  attention,&quot; said Tex G. Hall, president of the NCAI, the country's oldest 
  and largest Indian organization. There has not always been such a clamor among 
  presidential <br>
  candidates to get on Indian Country's dance card. But with an estimated 1.5 
  million registered voters and increasing political participation, Indians have 
  begun to command the attention of presidential candidates. <br>
</p>
<p>Healthy campaign contributions funded by the $15 billion Indian gaming industry 
  don't hurt either. &quot;Tribes are serious about looking for friends,&quot; 
  Hall said. &quot;And they shouldn't apologize for that.&quot; Tribal leaders 
  and members are increasingly sophisticated about pressing their agendas on candidates 
  and holding them to their promises for Indian Country after they're elected, 
  Hall said. By appearing at the convention, the candidates spoke directly to 
  between 3,000 and 4,000 tribal leaders and through them will send their messages 
  and platforms back to several hundred reservations. Kucinich promised a national 
  Indian policy that restates the separate sovereign status of tribes and enforces 
  it. &quot;This country has a moral obligation to keep its agreements,&quot; 
  he <br>
  said. <br>
</p>
<p>Clark said his agenda would borrow from a common Indian outlook: that actions 
  taken today should be viewed in terms of their effects on people who will live 
  seven generations from now. He said the rate of diabetes and living conditions 
  on many reservations are &quot;disgraceful&quot; and that he will work to make 
  them better. &quot;You've enriched us for generations,&quot; Clark said, &quot;but 
  sadly our country has not returned the favor.&quot; Gephardt said he would make 
  sure federal Indian programs are fully funded and would work with tribal governments, 
  not against them. &quot;You don't have to worry about me,&quot; Gephardt said. 
  &quot;I understand sovereignty. I believe in sovereignty. I will work with tribal 
  governments and respect them.&quot; Lieberman said the Bush administration has 
  dragged its feet on resolving Indian trust funds and that the long-standing 
  federal lawsuit on the issue would be settled with an accounting and payment 
  of the money owed if he is elected president. &quot;When I'm president,&quot; 
  Lieberman said, &quot;you're going to be treated with respect.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>Kerry promised to build and repair Bureau of Indian Affairs schools and to 
  put money into reservation roads and housing. &quot;Again and again,&quot; he 
  said, &quot;Native Americans are getting the short end of the stick. This is 
  one of the great scars of America.&quot; Clark and Kucinich were wrapped by 
  convention organizers in Indian blankets and given bumper stickers that said, 
  &quot;I'm Indian and I Vote.&quot; The bumper stickers and the slogan are part 
  of Native Vote 2004, an initiative to register Indian people to vote, to inform 
  them and to get them to the polls. NCAI is nonpartisan and will not endorse 
  a presidential candidate, executive director Jacqueline Johnson said. However, 
  NCAI is working with tribal governments to encourage them to schedule tribal 
  elections to coincide with national elections to get more tribal members to 
  the polls. <br>

  Writ of Habeas - Filed by Leonard Peltier concerning the Federal Parol Commission 
  Not Setting a Parole Date </p>
<p>Author: Bachrach, Barry A. Date: Sun, 11 Jan 2004 </p>
<p>The habeas filed by Leonard in the District of Colombia is extremely important 
  to Leonard. as requested, I am writing a summary of the position and why it 
  is a strong case. In 1984, Congress passed a sentencing reform act which ultimately 
  provided for the demise of the parole commission and required the parole commission 
  to establish a firm date of release for all pisoners still within it jurisdiction 
  within five years of the effective date of the act. The commission was required 
  to set the date within the guidlines and within enough time to give the prisoners 
  an opportunity to appeal from the date set by the commission. This statute became 
  effective on November 1, 1987, thus requiring the commission to establish a 
  firm date for parole within guidelines for leonard prior to October 31, 1992. 
  thus, under the applicable statute, as of November 1,1992, the parole commission 
  would have been abolished and Leonard would have been given a release date within 
  guidelines which means he would have been entitled to be released at 200 months, 
  or Novermber 1992(200 months from 2/76). </p>
<p>Thirty six days after the statute became effective, congress amended amended 
  the statute and, as applicable here, the amendment omitted the mandatory release 
  date criteria and reinstated the parole commission and its previously terminated 
  discretion. The Congressional amendment unconstitutionally violated Leonard's 
  rights by Congress' enacting an ex post facto punishment and a bill of attainder. 
  In short, once Congress mandated a release of those in Leonard's position within 
  a specific date within guidelines, Congress' subsequent repeal of that statute 
  and its thereby increasing the sentences of those in leonard's position constitutes 
  a violation of Leonard's Constitutional rights and means he has been unconstitutionally 
  incarcerated since 11/92. He should be immediately released. There is strong 
  law in Leonard's favor. we need to rally around this issue and insure that the 
  courts finally give Leonard the justice he is due. </p>
<p>thanks, Barry Bachrach. </p>

<p>Hau Kola, Hello my friends, my relatives: You can never imagine the heartfelt 
  comfort it brings to know you're not forgotten in prison. This is my 28th year, 
  and I've seen others come and go and return again. I can't help but feel a great 
  sorrow for many of these young men who keep coming back for one reason or another; 
  most of which are alcohol related offenses. So much has changed since I came 
  here and yet, in many ways, it's still the same.</p>
<p>The government, under the pretext of security and progress, liberated us from 
  our land, resources, culture, dignity and future. They violated every treaty 
  they ever made with us. I use the word &quot;liberated&quot; loosely and sarcastically, 
  in the same vein that I view their use of the words &quot;collateral damage&quot; 
  when they kill innocent men, women, and children. They describe people defending 
  their homeland as terrorists, savages and hostiles, and accuse us of being aggressors. 
  We have never fought a battle<br>
  or war that was not on our own land; we never fired the first shot ... ever. 
  My words reach out to the non-Indian: Look now before it's far too late - see 
  what is being done to others in your name and see what destruction you sanction 
  when you say nothing. Your own treaty, the one between yourselves and the government, 
  is being violated daily; this treaty is commonly known<br>
  as the Constitution.</p>
<p>With us, they started a little at a time, encroaching on our rights until we 
  had none at all. It will be the same for the Constitution; this is not conjecture, 
  but fact. We are not embattled with the color of man, but with the weakness 
  of man, a mindset that lusts for power and wealth at the expense of life. Men 
  of all colors, cultures and religions must stand together to oppose the genocidal 
  policies that face us all as the corporate world seeks to enslave all, and pit 
  one nation against another.</p>
<p>If you avoid breaking laws and do what you're told and ignore the poor, the 
  oppressed and the downtrodden - you probably won't be bothered. If you try to 
  right what is wrong, however, you will surely meet great opposition and run 
  the risk of imprisonment or death.</p>
<p>I am a Sun Dancer. I took a vow for my people. I chose to seek the Creator's 
  will and to follow it to the best of my ability. I WILL NOT STAND DOWN FROM 
  THAT VOW. I will continue to speak, write and organize until Grandfather himself 
  quiets my life. If I can do this in prison, I have no doubt you can do much 
  better from where you stand. I encourage you to do your best, be kind to one 
  another, seek harmony and balance with all natural life, enjoy what freedom 
  you have left, and most of<br>
  all, never, never give up.</p>

<p><br>
  UP-DATE ON MARCH </p>
<p>As many of you know last year the City of Tacoma refused to issue us a march 
  permit because we did not have the funds they demanded to pay for police, $1,000 
  for every 300 marchers, and they wanted us to have a million dollar insurance 
  bond. The ACLU filed a suit against the City of Tacoma and because of that suit 
  the City of Tacoma changed the city ordinance so that political marches no longer 
  had to pay for their right to march in Tacoma. </p>
<p>We though we would have no problems from the City of Tacoma with this years 
  march. We filed the papers for a march permit two months before the march and 
  did everything that the ACLU lawyers, the City of Tacoma Attorney and the City 
  of Tacoma ordinances told us to do. On January 12, 2004, we were issued our 
  permit. Our march permit was for marching in one lane in the street from Portland 
  Ave Park to the Federal Courthouse. Rather than trying to stop our march through 
  placing fees on it that we could not pay, this year the City of Tacoma is trying 
  to stop us through bureaucratization. In other words they are placing many conditions 
  on our permit that are impossible to fulfill. I should point out that no other 
  march, including peace marches and labor marches, have had these type of conditions 
  placed on them. We can only conclude that because our march is in support of 
  Leonard Peltier and speaks to the misconduct of the U.S. government in its policies 
  in dealing Native people, and that our march includes Native people from throughout 
  our region, that the actions of the City of Tacoma that are meant to try to 
  stop our march are racist to the core. </p>
<p>Following are some of the conditions that they have placed on us: </p>
<p>1.We are told two weeks before the march (even though we filed for the permit 
  two months before the march) that we must submit to the fire department a &#147;site 
  plan&#148; 30 days before our march. That is not in the city ordinances. That 
  alone makes fulfilling the conditions of the permit impossible and thus invalidates 
  our permit. </p>
<p>2.One week before our march we have to notify all &#147;merchants and neighbors&#148; 
  along our route of our march. I can tell you for a fact that this is not a condition 
  of other events because every year they close down the street in front of my 
  house for a run and no one has ever notified me. </p>
<p>3.We must notify all those taking part in the march in writing &#147;all rules, 
  regulations and laws related to pedestrians&#148;. They tried to pull that one 
  on us last year. If we have a march in the street the rules of pedestrians do 
  not apply to us. </p>
<p>4.We must ensure that no traffic will be blocked or delayed. How can we ensure 
  that if we are marching in the street? Even if we marched on the sidewalk we 
  could not ensure that because we cross streets. </p>
<p>5.&#147;All intersections must remain open for traffic&#148;. How about side 
  streets where we have the right-of-way? How do you march through intersections 
  and at the same time keep them completely open to traffic? </p>
<p>6.Fire hydrants, sprinkler connections, building entrances, exit doors etc 
  must have an unobstructed path to them at all times. How then can we march past 
  them? </p>
<p>7.Temporary wiring (that of our sound system) must be approved by the Electrical 
  Inspection Division. If they want to come out and look at our sound system they 
  can. </p>
<p>Our group has given this problem back to the lawyers and there maybe another 
  law suit in the works. We have issued a statement to the City of Tacoma that 
  states, we will not shut down our march because of their attempt to suppress 
  us by bureaucratization, We will march on Feb. 7th and it is our constitutional 
  right to do so. </p>
<p>DO NOT BELIEVE THE MEDIA! Last year some of the mass media stated that our 
  march had been called off even though it had not been called off. There is no 
  way that we will call off our march and rally. If need be we will march on the 
  sidewalk which we don&#146;t need a permit to do. </p>
<p>HOW YOU CAN HELP </p>
<p>Send this message to every list, news web site and to your friends. <br>
  Use this attempt at suppressing our right to march as additional motivation 
  to mobilize your groups, organizations and friends to come out to the Feb. 7th 
  Tacoma Justice for Leonard Peltier March. This march is not only in support 
  of Leonard Peltier, but also in support of the right to march for Leonard. E-mail 
  the Tacoma Mayor, Deputy Mayor, City Clerk and City Council in support of our 
  right to march for Leonard Peltier in Tacoma and ask them to end their attempt 
  to suppress our march through bureaucratization. Use the information above in 
  your messages. Please send a copy to our group at: bayou@blarg.net. We have 
  put all the e-mail addresses together so that all you need to do is cut and

<p align="center">MOBILIZATION FOR LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, FREE LEONARD PELTIER NOW! 
</p>
<p><br>
  Leonard Peltier is an Anishinabe/Lakota American Indian Movement activist who 
  was frame-up and convicted after a firefight on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 
  1975. The firefight took place as part of an attempt to suppress traditional 
  Oglala Lakota people who resisted losing any of their land to multinational 
  corporations who sought to mine uranium. </p>
<p>Now is a critical time in the struggle for social justice and the case of Leonard 
  Peltier. In past appeals of Leonard&#146;s case, his defense disproved the government&#146;s 
  case to the point that the government&#146;s prosecutor stated that the government 
  has no evidence connecting Leonard to the deaths of the FBI agents and that 
  he only &#147;aided and abetted&#148;. Given the fact that the first two AIM 
  members to go on trial were found not guilty for reason of self-defense, because 
  it was shown in court that there had been many killings (over 63) of Lakota 
  people and AIM members in two and a half years before the firefight and the 
  FBI came up to the AIM encampment in the same way that other drive-by shootings 
  had taken place. That means Leonard has spent all these years in prison for 
  &#147;aiding and abetting&#148; an act of self-defense. </p>
<p>The latest ruling from the Tenth Circuit Court Appeals stated, &#147;Much of 
  the government&#146;s behavior at Pine Ridge Reservation and in its prosecution 
  of Mr. Peltier is to be condemned. The government withheld evidence (it is still 
  withholding evidence). It intimidated witnesses. These facts are not disputed.&#148; 
  Even though the court acknowledged government misconduct in Leonard&#146;s trial, 
  the court rejected Leonard&#146;s appeal based on that trial. </p>
<p>We of the Tacoma Leonard Peltier Support Group are putting out a call for a 
  general mobilization of all people who believe in social justice to come together 
  in Tacoma on Feb. 7th to begin a renewed struggle to gain justice for Leonard 
  Peltier. The government&#146;s actions against Leonard should be viewed by all 
  as direct actions against all people&#146;s rights to liberty and justice. Please 
  join us on Feb. 7th and please join the mobilization by actively helping to 
  bring people out for our march and rally. One way to help is to get this message 
  out to everyone you know and post it on every list and web site that you can.

<p>YOU CAN ALSO HELP WITH THE FOLLOWING: </p>
<p>Legal Observers. Someone to videotape our march, rally and after rally meal. 
  There are three reasons for this. First, in case there are any problems or to 
  show that there were no problems, this has to do with legal matters. Second, 
  videotape of our events has been used around the country by Leonard Peltier 
  supporters. And last, we have videotapes of a number of our events and we hope 
  to edit them into one good video for supporters to use. So if anyone can videotape 
  this event please do so and give a copy of it to Arthur J. Miller, c/o Tacoma 
  LPSG, P.O. Box 5464, Tacoma, WA 98415-0464. <br>
</p>
<p>Photographers. We need photographs for the same reasons as we need video, plus 
  we send some of the best photos to the LPDC and to Leonard. Same as video please 
  send photos to Arthur J. Miller. <br>
</p>
<p>Banners. We only have three banners left which are rather old. One banner has 
  been to all 61 of our marches and has been all over the country. So we need 
  some new Leonard Peltier support banners. It would be nice if we had one banner 
  with the eagleman on it and Free Leonard Peltier and Tacoma Leonard Peltier 
  Support Group.We need as many Leonard Peltier support signs as possible. </p>

<p>May I suggest some letters to Presidential candidate and Senate Subcommittee 
  on Terrorism, Technology &amp; Homeland Security member John Edwards? This subcommittee 
  has jurisdiction to release the remaining withheld FBI<br>
  documents in the case of Leonard Peltier. May I suggest you click on the following

<p>Sen. John Edwards January 27, 2004</p>
<p>You sir are a member of the subcommittee of Technology, Terrorism and Homeland 
  Security. This is a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee as I understand. 
  This subcommittee has the jurisdiction to hold hearings in releasing documents 
  in the case of Leonard Peltier and the reservation murders of over 60 people 
  in South Dakota from 1973 to 1976. The FBI is currently stalling in releasing 
  these documents from individual offices despite the fact that there is a law 
  stating that such documents are classified as historical documents and should 
  be released to the public. Rep Barney Frank had released some documents in the 
  case of Leonard Peltier, but there are still documents not yet released. Thats 
  where the subcommittee of Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security comes 
  in. What I am asking for is for you and your colleges in this subcommittee to 
  do the public service that you were elected and appointed for. Will you work 
  in releasing these documents as Rep Barney Frank had done? And will you correct 
  a 28 year injustice by freeing Leonard Peltier as Bill Clinton had not done? 
  Shame on him. The proscecution doesn't know who killed their agents, yet Leonard 
  Peltier remains behind bars.</p>

  Subject: Election year</p>
<p>Dear Harvey and Els,</p>
<p>For starters I am overwhelmed by the support that seems to have a global origin. 
  I never even thought that this Nobel Peace Prize `nomination would have the 
  impact that it has. Whatever the outcome, thank you for the encouragement Harvey 
  to go through with this! What we now need to do, I think, is to make it exceptionally 
  attractive for the Norwegian Nobel people to award the prize to Leonard Peltier. 
  These Norwegians before have not been too shy to be controversial, although 
  we would not think Leonard's nomination to be controversial at all, but well 
  deserved and when using the correct wording they may be swayed towards Leonard 
  Peltier.</p>
<p>2004 is a US Presidential election year. As you well know these elections always 
  take place in November but the Peace Prize announcement is always during mid-October. 
  This is a unique opportunity for the Nobel Committee and the Nobel Institute 
  to influence the agenda for something with such global repercussions as the 
  US Presidential elections. Leonard Peltier as the recipient would be a blow 
  to the US justice system, to every President brushing his case aside and to 
  every candidate -nomatter his/her party-membership- refusing to lend an ear 
  to the valid claims of his case during the campaign. The lobbying opportunities 
  during that small window of opportunity of some 3 weeks might be worth their 
  weight in gold.</p>
<p>What a humiliation if the Peace Prize laureate would be unable to collect his 
  prize because he is in jail ... not in South Africa, not in<br>
  Birma/Myanmar, not in the People's Republic of China but in a US prison.</p>
<p>In hopes that it will inspire more and other people to send their letters of 
  support to the Norwegian Nobel Institute, not in email or fax, but by snailmail 
  to :</p>

<p>Update from the Field Buffalo Supporters,<br>
  <br>
  The dust from the Stephens Creek trap has hardly settled. Our volunteers have 
  returned with disturbing video and stories. Images of buffalo bucking and fighting 
  in the trap as they are forced into head clamps, struggling to escape until 
  their noses are tugged up by rings, forcing them into submission, while Park 
  Service employees test them. These images of hundreds of buffalo forced through 
  this gruesome procedure haunt me. Thinking of the 198 buffalo held in captivity 
  at the Stephens Creek trap, scarred by the experience of this brutal testing 
  procedure, fills me with anger and despair. When will the madness stop? Some 
  278 wild Yellowstone buffalo have already been killed this season. And the spring 
  migrations are just beginning.<br>
  <br>
  The other day I followed buffalo tracks down the Madison River. It was a beautiful 
  sunny spring afternoon. Bald eagles, trumpeter swans, blue herons, osprey, geese 
  and ravens filled the sky. The snow is melting, uncovering grass and sagebrush. 
  The frozen lake is receding. Sets of tracks clearly pointed their way to Horse 
  Butte. As we approached we saw a bull buffalo, moving briskly, stopping to wallow 
  and jump, grazing, and moving along again. Further along was a mixed herd of 
  buffalo continuing their trek westward.<br>
  <br>
  By the time we caught up to them, they had already reached the Horse Butte trap 
  and were grazing behind the police tape that warns the public that a piece of 
  our national forest is closed to the public good. We watched nervously as the 
  buffalo grazed by the trap. I have seen this sort of brazen resistance from 
  wild buffalo before. Sometimes it seems that they choose to roam into the danger 
  zone as an example of their wild spirit. Unwilling to be domesticated, they 
  challenge their would be captors with their courage. These majestic buffalo 
  inspire me with their resistance.<br>
  <br>
  I was relieved when they moved on down the Butte. For now they are being left 
  alone. Department of Livestock (DOL) agents have hazed some buffalo leaving 
  Yellowstone National Park near the highway, but have not mounted a major hazing 
  or capture operation on Horse Butte. These few dozen Yellowstone buffalo graze 
  wild and free on our national forests on Horse Butte. More buffalo will follow. 
  Volunteers reported from a flyover this weekend that several hundred buffalo 
  are gathered inside the park at Cougar Knoll, less than 10 miles from the border. 
  It is only a matter of time before their calving instinct brings them to Horse 
  Butte. Their fate is unknown.<br>
  <br>
  Our season is about to get even busier. If you or someone you know wants to 
  come out and join us in the field, now is the time. We will be running more 
  patrols in the next months as hundreds of buffalo migrate to Horse Butte and 
  risk their lives in the shadow of the Horse Butte trap. Even if you can't come 
  join us in the field, there is much you can do to help the Yellowstone buffalo. 
  Your tax-deductible donations help keep volunteers in the field and sustain 
  our efforts to fight this senseless slaughter.<br>
</p>
<p>Please read more below and watch for updates in the coming weeks. Thank you 
  for your support of the last wild buffalo in America.<br>

  Reflections on the recent slaughter in Gardiner<br>
  <br>
  Have you ever experienced something so horrible that you never thought anything 
  could compare? Then, sad as it could be, those memories are rekindled by acts 
  just as disheartening. These feelings haunt my mind after returning home to 
  West Yellowstone yesterday and finally slowing down long enough to digest my 
  sorrow. Having witnessed the 1997 mass slaughter of 1083 buffalo first hand, 
  this year jaunted those nightmares.<br>
  <br>
  First I must take my hat off and thank with all of my heart, George. Your efforts 
  to save the buffalo through dedication and compassion keep me strong. You and 
  your wife Susan are family for life and I already miss you both. The last major 
  capture held over 300 buffalo in the traps for several days. Buffalo family 
  members that had escaped capture circled the trap, lured back by the way that 
  the Park Service had left there as bait. This went on for several days giving 
  the appearance of visitors' day at the county jail. Cramming over 300 buffalo 
  in these death traps produced many injuries and one buffalo died. The Park Service 
  has still not released the cause of death.<br>
  <br>
  It seems that the Park has problems even communicating between themselves. The 
  rangers, wranglers or park police are the ones that haze and capture the buffalo. 
  They don't consult, get advice, or in some cases, get along with the buffalo 
  biologists. The rangers say they have hazed groups of animals several times 
  but the radio collars tell the biologists a different story. The other day on 
  a conference call with the Park Service I brought up the question of why untested 
  buffalo are allowed on the national forest in Eagle Creek, but not in the Gallatin 
  National Forest near West Yellowstone. Wayne Brewster said the difference is 
  that there are no cows or private lands up in Eagle Creek. As we speak Bill 
  Hoppe's cows are giving birth, next to his <br>
  &gt;neighbors' houses and the over 100 buffalo that have wintered in the Eagle 
  Creek area. On the west side in the Gallatin National Forest, cows are only 
  here from June 15 through October 15. For the last two years, there have been 
  no cows on the national forest and they can not return until the Forest Service 
  completes an environmental impact statement. To date the Forest Service has 
  no plans to do the EIS.<br>
  <br>
  I have grown tired of the double talk. If the Park Service feels so bad about 
  being involved, then STAND UP and be counted. Voice your outrage and pull out 
  of the bison management plan. Show the world that you are able to protect our 
  national treasure, the buffalo and Yellowstone National Park. Expose Montana's 
  ability to justify anything for the cattle industry. Return the responsibility 
  and financial burden for the buffalo slaughter to Montana, the state demanding 
  zero tolerance for wild buffalo, not on the US taxpayer.<br>

  Last Words...Three letters to the editor on behalf of the buffalo were published 
  in the Bozeman Chronicle this week...<br>
  <br>
  March 19, 2004 Spend bison slaughter money on real solution The government is 
  taking our wildlife. Is it worth it and for what? These are two questions reasonable 
  people are asking about our government's bison slaughter program. We spend more 
  than $3 million annually, hazing, confining and slaughtering wild bison both 
  within and near Yellowstone National Park. Supposedly, we do this to protect 
  the livestock industry's brucellosis-free status. However, the government will 
  likely begin killing wild bison regardless of their disease status (Bozeman 
  Chronicle, March 16). In reality, few domestic cattle use the area and most 
  of them belong to the Church Universal and Triumphant (CUT).<br>
  <br>
  Supposedly the CUT moved to Montana for &quot;spiritual renewal&quot; and to 
  live in harmony with the environment. Unfortunately, the consequences of their 
  land use and management choices near Yellowstone National Park have led to everything 
  but renewal and harmony. As well, the Department of Livestock (DOL), the agency 
  responsible for regulating livestock in Montana, turns its back on reckless 
  livestock husbandry practices that unnecessarily threaten the entire industry. 
  If DOL doesn't care, why should<br>
  we?<br>
  <br>
  The Wyoming livestock industry lost its brucellosis-free status. Interestingly, 
  brucellosis was probably transferred to cattle from wild elk. Regardless, has 
  the sky fallen in Wyoming? No. Dr. Jim Logan, Wyoming's state veterinarian, 
  notes 100,000 to 300,000 livestock will be tested in Wyoming (Belgrade News, 
  Feb. 24). At $5 per test, a worst-case scenario leads to an annual cost of $1.5 
  million.<br>
  <br>
  Oh, by the way, taxpayers picked up the tab there. We could do the same here. 
  The cost of testing cattle in Wyoming is half the cost of our government-run 
  bison slaughter program, and cattle testing is much more humane. Let's spend 
  the $1.5 million we save each year on habitat, a real solution.<br>
  <br>
  Of course, wild bison have never transmitted brucellosis to cattle in the wild, 
  so the questions remain -- IS IT WORTH IT AND FOR WHAT? When the DOL, CUT and 
  our government turn their backs on reasonable solutions, one has to wonder.<br>

  March 23, 2004 Urge agencies to stop bison slaughter<br>
  <br>
  I want to thank Scott McMillion for his stories on the current Yellowstone bison 
  situation. People have to realize that the Montana Department of Livestock (DOL) 
  has no intention of tolerating bison on our public lands in Montana even when 
  no cattle are present for miles around. It is all about power and control. Karen 
  Cooper of DOL is quoted as saying, &quot;It really doesn't have anything to 
  do with the cattle there (on the CUT property). It has to do with the fact that 
  there is disease in the herd (of park bison).&quot; This is totally disingenuous! 
  Of course this situation has everything to do with livestock, which wrongly 
  take precedence over native wildlife too often on our public lands. It is cattle 
  that should be managed, not bison. Bison tolerate brucellosis. It is not a threat 
  to people. To wipe out this disease in wild herds is to condemn these herds. 
  Do we really want to eradicate this genetically unique herd? Do we want them 
  to be less wild? Do we want them sent to slaughter from our most famous national 
  park?<br>
  <br>
  I went to Yellowstone two days ago because I was distraught. From a mile away, 
  with good binoculars, I could see the huge corral complex, which is off of the 
  old Corwin Springs to Gardiner Road to the west. The public cannot get anywhere 
  close (because of safety issues and effect on the bison?). There are warning 
  signs everywhere. It was horrible to see. Here are park bison in corrals in 
  the park, which is supposed to be their refuge, tested, ear-taged, fed hay, 
  just like cattle, calves vaccinated with a drug not proven effective in bison. 
  I cried.<br>
  <br>
  I urge the concerned public to go see this travesty. Our tax dollars are funding 
  the slaughter of our native wildlife to protect the cattle industry. Let them 
  protect themselves. Vaccinate their cattle and graze them away from the bison 
  migratory routes north and west out of the park. I talked with park officials, 
  and they don't like the situation either, but there is little they can do because 
  of the current bison management plan.<br>
</p>
<p>The Park Service input into this plan did soften it. DOL would have liked to 
  go into the park to kill all the bison that tested positive (for antibodies, 
  not necessarily the disease), maybe half of the herd. The Park Service would 
  not allow that. There was compromise. These individual bison who exercise their 
  urge to move north (or west) are now sacrificed, when there are no cattle for 
  miles. Pressure DOL, pressure the Church Universal and Triumphant and the Park 
  Service. This is bureaucracy gone amok. Bison deserve a better fate.<br>

  March 25, 2004 Buffalo on public land should be managed as wildlife Yellowstone 
  National Park is trapping our wild buffalo, and with the complicity of the Montana 
  Department of Livestock herding them into cattle trucks for transport to slaughter. 
  With high fanfare of official uniforms, badges, sidearms and flashing red lights 
  on official cars, they are sending them down the highway to death, for no good 
  reason. Our native buffalo evolved over thousands of years to become fit for 
  Montana's land, water and climate. They must be allowed to move into public 
  wildlife winter ranges in the Yellowstone, Gallatin and Madison River basins. 
  Native genetically pure wild buffalo are more valuable than the few cows that 
  are causing their slaughter.<br>
  <br>
  Buffalo are being trucked out without even testing for brucellosis. Who gave 
  the right to Yellowstone Park and Montana Department of Livestock to slaughter 
  our buffalo? I am requesting that Yellowstone National Park, Gallatin National 
  Forest and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks remove themselves from this quagmire 
  and let Montana Department of Livestock and the Animal and Plant Health Service 
  roast in hell for their actions.<br>
  <br>
  Do this before the killing once again plunges us into national disgrace over 
  one of our national symbols. We can balance our buffalo numbers on public land 
  by managing them as wildlife, with discrete, fair chase, efficient, money-making 
  public hunts that will be a fair harvest open to all and participated in by 
  many. As biologist Jim Posewitz said, &quot;Montana still has the opportunity 
  to do it right. After that is accomplished, let the other states feel free to 
  follow.&quot;<br>

  Subject: A Primer on Leonard Peltier, COINTELPRO, AIM, and FBI Suppression of 
  Indigenous Activities</p>
<p>LEONARD PELTIER, COINTELPRO, AIM &amp; Peltier:</p>
<p>FBI Suppression of Indigenous Activists in the 1970s: A Primer</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is COINTELPRO?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Despite its carefully contrived image as the nation's premier crime fighting 
  agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has alway functioned primarily 
  as America's political police. This role includes not only the collection of 
  intelligence on the activities of political dissidents &amp; groups, but often 
  times counterintelligence operations to thwart those activities. </p>
<p> Although covert operations have been employed throughout FBI history, the 
  formal COunter INTELligence PROgram, or COINTELPRO, of the period from 1956 
  to 1971 was the first to be both broadly targeted &amp; centrally directed. 
  The stated goals of COINTELPRO were to expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, 
  or otherwise neutralize those persons or organizations that the FBI decided 
  were enemies of the State.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>COINTELPRO Techniques</p>
<p> </p>
<p> At its most extreme dimension, political dissidents have been eliminated outright 
  or sent to prison for the rest of their lives. Many more, however, were neutralized 
  by intimidation, harassment, discrediting, &amp; a whole assortment of authoritarian 
  &amp; illegal tactics. Neutralization, as explained on record by the FBI, didn't 
  necessarily pertain to the apprehension of parties in the commission of a crime, 
  the preparation of evidence against them, &amp; securing of a judicial conviction. 
  Rather, the FBI simply made activists incapable of engaging in political activity 
  by whatever means. </p>
<p> For those not assessed as being in themselves a security risk but engaged 
  in what the Bureau viewed to be politically objectionable activity, those techniques 
  consisted of disseminating derogatory information to the target's family, friends 
  &amp; associates, or visiting &amp; questioning them. False information was 
  planted in the press. The targets' efforts to speak in public were frustrated, 
  &amp; employers were contacted to try to get them fired. Anonymous letters were 
  sent by the FBI to targets' spouses, accusing them of infidelity. Other letters 
  contained death threats. These strategies are well-documented, for example, 
  in the case of Martin Luther King, Jr. Records also show that activists in the 
  1960s were repeatedly arrested on any excuse until they could no longer make 
  bail. </p>
<p> In addition, the FBI made use of informants, often quite violent &amp; emotionally 
  disturbed individuals, to present false testimony to the courts &amp; frame 
  COINTELPRO targets for crimes the FBI knew they did not commit. In some cases 
  the charges were quite serious, including murder.</p>
<p> Another option was snitch jacketing where the FBI made the target look like 
  a police informant or an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency. This served 
  the dual purposes of isolating &amp; alienating important leaders, as well as 
  increasing the general level of fear &amp; factionalism in the group.<br>
</p>
<p>Many counterintelligence techniques involved the use of paid informants. Informants 
  became agents provocateurs by raising controversial issues at meetings to take 
  advantage of ideological divisions; promoting enmity with other groups; or inciting 
  the group to violent acts, even to the point of providing them with weapons. 
  Over the years, FBI provocateurs repeatedly urged &amp; initiated violent acts, 
  including forceful disruptions of meetings &amp; demonstrations, attacks on 
  police, bombings, etc.</p>
<p> The full story of COINTELPRO may never be told. The Bureau's files were never 
  seized by Congress or the courts or sent to the National Archives. Some were 
  destroyed. In addition, many counter-intelligence operations were never committed 
  to writing as such, or involved open investigations making ex-operatives legally 
  prohibited from talking about them. Most operations remained secret until long 
  after the damage had been done. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The FBI has continued to use proven COINTELPRO tactics into the 21st century. 
  In fact, many such techniques are now overt, conducted under the guise of Homeland 
  Security &amp; even codified in key pieces of legislation such as the U.S. Patriot 
  Act, the government's response to the September 11, 2002, attack on the World 
  Trade Center twin towers in New York City.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is AIM?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The American Indian Movement (AIM), an Indigenous rights group committed to 
  uniting all Native Peoples in an effort to uplift their communities &amp; promote 
  cultural pride &amp; sovereignty, was founded in 1968 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<p> The FBI used all of the above COINTELPRO tactics against AIM, including the 
  wholesale jailing of the Movement's leadership. Virtually every known AIM leader 
  in the United States was incarcerated in either state or federal prisons since 
  (or even before) the organization's formal emergence in 1968, some repeatedly. 
  After the 1973 siege of Wounded Knee, for example, the FBI caused 542 separate 
  charges to be filed against those it identified as key AIM leaders. This resulted 
  in only 15 convictions, all on such petty or contrived offenses as interfering 
  with a federal officer in the performance of his duty. Organization members 
  often languished in jail for months as the cumulative bail required to free 
  them outstripped resource capabilities of AIM &amp; supporting groups.</p>
<p> In 1975, against the American Indian Movement in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, 
  the FBI COINTELPRO conducted a full-fledged counterinsurgency war - complete 
  with death squads, disappearances &amp; assassinations - not dissimilar to those 
  conducted in third world countries such as El Salvador &amp; Guatemala.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who is Leonard Peltier?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Leonard Peltier is a citizen of the Anishinabe &amp; Dakota/Lakota Nations 
  who has been unjustly imprisoned for nearly three decades. When the government 
  can select a person for criminal persecution because of their political activity, 
  when they can fabricate evidence against that person &amp; suppress evidence 
  proving that fabrication, &amp; prosecute a person &amp; put them in prison 
  for any amount of time, let alone for life, then you have a political prisoner. 
  Accordingly, Amnesty International considers Peltier a political prisoner who 
  should be immediately &amp; unconditionally released.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What led to Peltier's conviction?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> It began in the early 1970s on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (SD), when 
  tensions between then tribal chairman Dick Wilson &amp; the traditionalists 
  began to escalate. Wilson was pro-assimilation, meaning he believed Native Peoples 
  should discard their traditions to join mainstream American society. Traditionalists, 
  on the other hand, felt it important to maintain their culture &amp; land base. 
  Wilson favored those who were pro-assimilation by giving them jobs &amp; other 
  assistance while neglecting the needs of the traditionalists who often lived 
  in the worst poverty. The growing conflict prompted traditionalists to join 
  together with AIM to protect their way of life. In response, Wilson joined with 
  the FBI to destroy the Movement the agency perceived as a threat to the American 
  way of life. The result was disastrous.</p>
<p> In 1973, local traditionalists &amp; AIM occupied the Pine Ridge hamlet of 
  Wounded Knee to protest the many abuses they were suffering. (This was the same 
  site where, less than 100 years earlier, the horrific Wounded Knee massacre 
  was perpetrated against over 300 Lakotas, mostly women &amp; children.) Instead 
  of listening to the Natives' grievances, the government responded militarily, 
  firing over 250,000 rounds of ammunition into the area &amp; killing two occupants 
  whose deaths were never investigated. The occupation lasted 71 days &amp; ended 
  only after the government promised investigations into the complaints. The investigations 
  never materialized &amp; conditions on the reservation worsened. After Wounded 
  Knee, Wilson outlawed AIM activities on the reservation. Traditionalists were 
  not allowed to meet or attend traditional ceremonies. Wilson hired vigilantes 
  who called themselves Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONs) to enforce his 
  rules.</p>
<p> The three years following Wounded Knee are often referred to as the Pine Ridge 
  Reign of Terror because anyone associated with AIM was targeted for violence. 
  Their homes were burned &amp; their cars were run off the road. They were struck 
  by cars, shot in drive-by shootings, &amp; beaten. Between 1973 &amp; 1976, 
  over 60 traditionalists were murdered. Pine Ridge had the highest murder rate 
  in the United States. Scores of other people were assaulted. In almost every 
  case, witness accounts indicated GOON responsibility, but nothing was done to 
  stop the violence. On the contrary, the FBI supplied the GOONs with weaponry 
  &amp; intelligence on AIM &amp; looked the other way as the GOONs committed 
  crimes against members as well as supporters of AIM. </p>
<p> As the situation worsened, the traditionalists asked AIM to return to the 
  reservation to offer protection. Leonard Peltier was among those who answered 
  the call. He &amp; a dozen others set up camp on the Jumping Bull ranch at Pine 
  Ridge, the home of a number of traditional families.</p>
<p>On June 26, 1975, two FBI agents in unmarked cars pursued a red pickup truck 
  onto the Jumping Bull ranch. They were ostensibly looking for Jimmy Eagle, who 
  had gotten into a fistfight &amp; stolen a pair of cowboy boots. Gunshots rang 
  out. While mothers fled the area with their children, other residents started 
  to return fire. A shootout erupted between the FBI agents &amp; the residents. 
  Law enforcement immediately mobilized. Within a couple hours, over 150 FBI swat 
  team members, Bureau of Indian Affairs police, &amp; GOONs surrounded the ranch.</p>
<p> Peltier helped lead a small group of teenagers out of the area, barely escaping 
  through the hail of bullets. When the shootout ended, AIM member Joseph Killsright 
  Stuntz (below) lay dead, shot in the head by a sniper. His death has never been 
  investigated. The two FBI agents also lay dead - wounded in the gun battle, 
  then shot at point blank range.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Years later, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit, it was documented 
  that: * the FBI had been closely monitoring AIM activities on &amp; off the 
  reservation &amp; had even been preparing for paramilitary law enforcement operations 
  on Pine Ridge one month before the shootout. * the two agents had possessed 
  a map that highlighted the Jumping Bull Ranch &amp; labeled the family's storage 
  cellars as bunkers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to FBI documents, over 40 Native people participated in the shootout, 
  both AIM &amp; non-AIM. Yet only 4 persons were indicted for the deaths of the 
  agents: 3 AIM leaders - Dino Butler, Bob Robideau, &amp; Leonard Peltier - &amp; 
  Jimmy Eagle. Butler &amp; Robideau were the first to be arrested &amp; tried. 
  The jury found that Butler &amp; Robideau were justified in returning fire given 
  the atmosphere of terror that existed on Pine Ridge during that time. Further, 
  they were not tied to the point blank shootings. Butler &amp; Robideau were 
  found innocent on grounds of self-defense.</p>
<p> The FBI was outraged by the verdict. They dropped charges against Jimmy Eagle 
  so that, according to their own memos, . the full prosecutive weight of the 
  federal government could be directed against Leonard Peltier. Peltier, meanwhile, 
  had fled to Canada believing he would never receive a fair trial. On February 
  6, 1976, he was apprehended. The FBI presented the Canadian court with affidavits 
  from a woman named Myrtle Poor Bear who claimed she had been Peltier's girl 
  friend &amp; had<br>
  witnessed him shoot the agents. Peltier was extradited to the U.S.</p>
<p>However, Poor Bear had never met Peltier, nor had she been present at the time 
  of the shooting - a fact later confirmed by the U.S. Prosecutor. Despite Poor 
  Bear's subsequent declaration that she had given false statements under duress, 
  having been terrorized by FBI agents, Peltier's extradition was not reversed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How was Peltier's trial unfair?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Leonard Peltier was returned to the U.S. where his case was mysteriously transferred 
  from the judge who had presided over the trial of his co-defendants to a different 
  judge - one who made rulings that severely handicapped the defense. Also, the 
  FBI had carefully analyzed the Butler-Robideau case and, this time, they were 
  determined to secure a conviction. The cards were stacked against Peltier &amp; 
  a fair trial was out of reach.</p>
<p>* Myrtle Poor Bear &amp; other key witnesses were banned from testifying about 
  FBI misconduct. * Testimony about the Pine Ridge Reign of Terror was severely 
  restricted. * Important evidence, such as conflicting ballistics reports, was 
  ruled inadmissible * The red pickup truck that had been followed onto the ranch 
  was suddenly described as Peltier's red &amp; white van. (Agents who described 
  the vehicle as a red pickup truck during the Butler-Robideau trial could no 
  longer recollect their previous testimony.) The jury was sequestered &amp; surrounded 
  by U.S. Marshals at all times. leading them to believe that AIM was a threat 
  to their safety. * Three young Native witnesses were forced to falsely testify 
  against Peltier after being detained &amp; terrorized by FBI agents. </p>
<p> Still, the U.S. Prosecutor failed to produce a single witness who could identify 
  Peltier as the shooter. Instead, the government tied a bullet casing found near 
  the bodies to the alleged murder weapon, arguing that this gun had been the 
  only one of its kind used during the shootout &amp; that it had belonged to 
  Peltier. </p>
<p> The above FOIA suit uncovered FBI documents that showed that: * more than 
  one weapon of the type attributed to Peltier had been present at the scene. 
  * the FBI had intentionally concealed a ballistics report that showed the shell 
  casing could not have come from the alleged murder weapon. * the agents undoubtedly 
  followed a red pickup truck onto the land, not the red &amp; white van driven 
  by Peltier. * compelling evidence against several other suspects existed &amp; 
  was concealed. Unaware of these facts, the jury convicted Peltier. He was sentenced 
  to two consecutive life terms. Peltier is currently imprisoned at the U.S. penitentiary 
  at Leavenworth, Kansas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What has happened since the trial?</p>
<p> After many of the above abuses surfaced in the 1980s, the Peltier defense 
  team demanded a new trial. During subsequent oral arguments, the U.S. Prosecutor 
  admitted, . we can't prove who shot those agents. The appellate court found 
  that Peltier may have been acquitted had evidence not been improperly withheld 
  by the FBI. However, a new trial was denied on the grounds of a legal technicality. 
</p>
<p> In 1993, Peltier requested Executive Clemency from then President Clinton. 
  An intensive campaign was launched - supported by Native &amp; human rights 
  organizations, members of Congress, community &amp; church groups, labor organizations, 
  luminaries, &amp; celebrities. Even Judge Heaney, who authored the above court 
  decision, expressed firm support for Peltier's release. The Peltier case became 
  a national issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> On November 7, 2000, during a live radio interview, Clinton stated that he 
  would seriously consider Peltier's request for clemency &amp; make a decision 
  before leaving office on January 20, 2001. In response, the FBI launched a major 
  disinformation campaign in both the media &amp; among key government officials. 
  On December 15, over 500 FBI agents marched in front of the White House to oppose 
  clemency. On January 20, the list of clemencies granted by Clinton was released 
  to the media. Without explanation, Peltier's name had been excluded. </p>
<p> Mr. Peltier has served a significantly longer period of time thannormally 
  would be served before a grant of parole in similar cases. Various FBI agents, 
  together with the U.S. Prosecutor, are present at parolehearings to personally 
  oppose Mr. Peltier's release. The U.S. Parole Commission has made it clear that 
  parole will not even be considered until the year 2008 - when Peltier will have 
  served twice the normal time according to the Commission's own congressionally 
  mandated guidelines. No adequate reason has been given for such arbitrary &amp; 
  discriminatory treatment. Instead, the Parole Commission has stated the denial 
  of parole is based on Mr. Peltier's participation in the premeditated &amp; 
  cold blooded execution or the ambush of the two agents. Yet, there is no evidence 
  that Mr. Peltier ever fired the fatal shots. This has been admitted to by the 
  government attorneys themselves. At one parole hearing it was made clear that 
  Mr. Peltier will not receive parole until he recognizes his crime or, in short, 
  confesses to a crime he didn't commit.</p>
<p> Leonard Peltier has made remarkable contributions to humanitarian &amp; charitable 
  causes during his many years behind bars. He sponsors an annual Christmas drive 
  for clothes &amp; toys for the children of Pine Ridge, helps to establish Native 
  American Scholarship funds, assists programs for battered women &amp; substance 
  abuse recovery, collaborates to improve medical care on the reservations, &amp; 
  assists other prisoners in developing prison art programs. Peltier also has 
  adopted children in Guatemala &amp; El Salvador. As a result, he has received 
  recognition &amp; acclaim from many human rights groups, including the Human 
  Rights Commission of Spain &amp; the Ontario (Canada) Federation of Labour.</p>
<p> Mr. Peltier suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure &amp; a heart condition. 
  According to an affiliate of Physicians for Human Rights, he risks blindness, 
  kidney failure &amp; stroke in the future, given his inadequate diet, living 
  conditions, &amp; health care. Our concepts of justice &amp; good government 
  require that such tragic errors of the past be set right. We ask that you act 
  now to secure Mr. Leonard Peltier's freedom.</p>

  Dear Friends... Here's an advance peek of few pages from the new book ~HAVE 
  YOU THOUGHT of LEONARD PELTIER LATELY?~ which we've put together and will shortly 
  be printing. This extract revolves around my answer to a gal who asks why I, 
  a Jew, concern myself with the fate of a Native American political prisoner 
  in Leavenworth. I sent her these paragraphs...partly from the book's Foreword, 
  partly from the body of the text.</p>
<p>[FROM THE AUTHOR'S FOREWORD]</p>
<p>THIS BOOK ~Have You Thought of Leonard Peltier Lately? ~ wasn't written. It 
  was-and continues to be- lived. What you read and see in these pages-and in 
  our companion website www.haveyouthought.com -are the artifacts of an ongoing 
  struggle for one man's freedom and for all of our self-respect. The issue of 
  Leonard's freedom should be seen not simply in regard to his own personal physical 
  freedom, but as a key to freedom for tens of thousands of others in our American 
  Gulag, the innocent callously imprisoned along with the guilty, serving time 
  for crimes they never committed. I personally champion Leonard's cause not as 
  a Native American activist, which I'm not-though I empathize profoundly with 
  the cause of indigenous peoples everywhere-but as an American, as a Jew, and 
  as a human being, a 'Citizen of Planet Earth.'</p>
<p> We are all indigenous to somewhere.</p>
<p>I'm reminded of the words of an Aboriginal Australian Wisdomkeeper named Lilla 
  Watson: &quot;If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But 
  if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us 
  work together.&quot;</p>
<p>I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT that my own empathy with indigenous peoples and their sufferings 
  relates to the still searingly recent Holocaust upon my own people, the Jews 
  of Europe, a calamity that haunts every fiber of my being to this day-witness 
  the scores of books on Auschwitz and histories and testimonies of the Jewish 
  Holocaust on my bookshelves, and the dust-gathering boxes of notes and drafts 
  for a yet-to-be-finished Holocaust novel of my own. When the Nazi war on the 
  Jews ended in 1945, I was just ten years old, living carefree in Chicago-too 
  young to grasp even remotely what had happened to my own People on the killing 
  fields of Europe, much less to do anything about it. Had my grandparents not 
  emigrated to America in the early 1900's, I-or any Jewish child my age in Lithuania 
  or the Ukraine, where my maternal and paternal families came from-would likely 
  have been rounded up for the death camps in 1941-1942 or so. There's a famous 
  historic photograph of a young Jewish boy of just about my age at that time, 
  holding his arms in the air in frozen terror as a Nazi officer points a Luger 
  pistol directly at his head during a round-up of Jews in the Warsaw ghetto. 
  I often contemplate that image with an anguished mixture of sorrow, anger, guilt 
  and frustration.</p>
<p> That boy-my other Self, in a way-likely died in the death camps circa 1942. 
  I myself-blessed to be an American-lived through it all, quite unknowing of 
  my great good luck at the time, and today I continue unabashedly to live a full, 
  challenging life at age 68 more than six decades later. Yes, God Bless America.</p>
<p> So when-as much by accident as inclination, though both are involved-I find 
  myself, first as a journalist, later as an author, witnessing a Holocaust in 
  this same land of America-a Holocaust against American Indian Peoples that has 
  taken millions of lives over the past 500 years-and, what's more, a Holocaust 
  that in many ways is still going on, all but totally disregarded by American 
  society at large, then my Jewish outrage, my aboriginal outrage, my indigenous 
  outrage, my human outrage resonates powerfully against such injustice-and so 
  should all of ours. I become drawn to the victims, and, yes, to their Cause-to 
  which I here give a capital 'C'. That Cause, is quite simply, To survive as 
  a People. The Jews of Auschwitz would have understood that.</p>
<p> Lakota Elder Mat King, when he was explaining to me the concept of the 'Original 
  Instructions' given to Indian Peoples by Tunkashila, the Great Spirit, emphasized: 
  &quot;The first Instruction is to survive as a People! Nothing is more important 
  than that! You understand that and you understand a lot about us Indian People. 
  We intend to survive.and that means to survive as a People!&quot; Yes, my liberation 
  is bound up with theirs.and with Leonard's.</p>
<p> As his Lakota/Nakota/Dakota brethren of the Great Sioux Nation say on sacred 
  occasions: Mitakuye Oyasin-'We are all related'.'We are all One Family of Humankind.' 
  Yes, we are. If only we might all realize it.</p>

<p>SETTLEMENT REACHED IN PELTIER'S LAWSUIT AGAINST EDITOR PAUL DEMAIN</p>
<p>The terms of a settlement agreement were fulfilled today in a defamation lawsuit 
  filed over one year ago by Native American activist and political prisoner Leonard 
  Peltier against Paul DeMain, editor of News From Indian Country. According to 
  Peltier's attorney, Barry Bachrach, Mr. DeMain had avoided giving a deposition 
  for several months. Just before a deposition was finally to take place, on or 
  about April 9, 2004, the two parties began settlement negotiations. With nothing 
  further to negotiate, an agreement was reached on April 16th. However, over 
  one month later, DeMain had yet to fulfill the terms of the agreement. Therefore, 
  on May 24, 2004, a motion to enforce the settlement agreement was filed with 
  the Eighth U.S. District Court of Claims in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Subsequent 
  to that filing, Pursuant to the agreement, DeMain released the following statement 
  which incorporates language he had originally proposed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> &quot;.I agree with Leonard Peltier that there have been numerous instances 
    of questionable conduct by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies in connection 
    with prosecution of Native Americans in this country. I also agree that the 
    legal, social, and political environment prevailing on the Pine Ridge Reservation 
    during the 1970s could be legitimately compared to a war zone. In my opinion, 
    there has also been widespread misconduct in the judicial system historically 
    with respect to cases involving Native Americans.</p>
  <p> More particularly, I do not believe that Leonard Peltier received a fair 
    trial in connection with the murders of which he was convicted. Certainly 
    he is entitled to one. Nor do I believe, according to the evidence and testimony 
    I now have, that Mr. Peltier had any involvement in the death of Anna Mae 
    Aquash.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In exchange for this public statement, Peltier has dismissed with prejudice 
  his lawsuit against DeMain. &quot;Justice is possible for both Anna Mae and 
  Leonard Peltier, but justice won't be done in either case by people falsely 
  pointing fingers of blame. Leonard's only concern is for the truth, which is 
  why monetary damages are not a part of this settlement. </p>
<p>A member of the American Indian Movement (AIM), Peltier was charged for the 
  June 26, 1975, shooting deaths of two agents of the FBI on the Pine Ridge Indian 
  Reservation in South Dakota. Peltier, who still maintains his innocence, was 
  convicted of the killings in 1977 and sentenced to two consecutive life terms. 
  He is currently imprisoned at the United States penitentiary at Leavenworth, 
  Kansas. &quot;Statements were authored by DeMain that were false, defamatory, 
  and malicious. They were then circulated by DeMain's newspaper with reckless 
  disregard and with the knowledge that they were false,&quot; explained BarryBachrach, 
  Peltier's attorney. &quot;DeMain had stated, as a matter of fact, that Mr. Peltier 
  was guilty of shooting the two FBI agents when the government itself has repeatedly 
  admitted that it did not and cannot prove that Mr. Peltier shot the agents. 
  ,&quot; Bachrach added. &quot;DeMain also implied Peltier's involvement in the 
  Pine Ridge murder of fellow AIM member Anna Mae Pictou Aquash in 1976. We couldn't 
  let such statements stand.&quot; &quot;Justice is possible for both Anna Mae 
  and Leonard Peltier, but justice won't be done in either case by people falsely 
  pointing fingers of blame. Leonard's only concern is for the truth, which is 
  why monetary damages are not a part of this settlement.<br>
</p>
<p>Leonard Peltier's case has been the topic of several books - &quot;In the Spirit 
  of Crazy Horse&quot; by renowned writer Peter Matthiessen, for example - and 
  documentaries, most notably &quot;Incident at Oglala&quot; produced by Robert 
  Redford. Amnesty International, convinced that he did not receive a fair trial 
  and will not receive fair consideration for parole or executive clemency, has 
  called for Peltier's immediate and unconditional release. </p>
<p>Leonard Peltier, noted for his continuing activism and humanitarian works, 
  also was recently nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
