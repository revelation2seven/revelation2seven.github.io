<p align="center">THE PROPHET'S CONFERENCE</p>
<p align="center">(If only it was all so easy).</p>
<p>SATISH KUMAR, one of the more remarkable persons blessing our planet, will 
  be speaking at THE GREAT RETHINKING OXFORD: MAKING A DIFFERENCE, a singularly 
  important conference bringing leading visionaries together to help rethink and 
  reshape our collective future. This gathering will take place for its second 
  year at the rather infamous Oxford University Union Debating Chamber, this time 
  during the weekend of 10-12 SEPTEMBER.</p>
<p> This international gathering of leaders in environmental and social activism, 
  alternative and holistic health, indigenous shamanic studies and practices, 
  and domains of the spirit will assist in the design of delegate-led collaborative 
  follow-up action projects which the participants are encouraged to conceive 
  for joint implementation in their home communities after the conference.</p>

<p align="center">SATISH KUMAR AND HIS LIFE OF REVERENCE<br>
  By Jong-Chul Kim</p>
<p>HARTLAND, A SMALL village nestled in the south of England, has become an internationally 
  well-known mecca of the green movement. Resurgence, the famous bi-monthly magazine 
  devoted to ecology has been edited in the village for more than 30 years. It 
  also has a &quot;Small School,&quot; an exemplary model of what is called now 
  the alternative school. Besides, there is in Hartland a publishing house named 
  &quot;Green Books,&quot; which has been producing many important titles concerning 
  both philosophical and practical dimensions of the green movement.</p>
<p>A bit away from Hartland is Dartington House where Schumacher College, the 
  internationally acclaimed adults' institution, is located with a medieval historic 
  building as its centre. The college offers the 2-3 week program in which students 
  are supposed to participate in a communal life, and regularly perspicacious 
  intellectuals and activists are invited into the program as lecturers. Among 
  them are James Lovelock, independent scientist widely known for his theory of 
  Gaia, and Fritjof Capra, philosopher of &quot;new physics,&quot; and others 
  who are searching for a new intellectual, moral, spiritual foundation for an 
  alternative culture.</p>
<p>What is striking to me is the fact that all these things are being put into 
  practice mainly by the efforts of a man from India. His name is SATISH KUMAR. 
  He has never gotten a college diploma. He is neither a great scholar nor a charismatic 
  leader of any spiritual sect. In every sense he might be called an ordinary 
  man. In spite of that, he has excellently worked in supporting the global green 
  movement for more than 20 years. He has always been central to the various projects, 
  which give hope and consolation to many people in the world dreaming of a sane, 
  compassionate and sustainable culture beyond the despair of industrial civilization.</p>
<p>Besides, Satish Kumar seems to be at home doing such extraordinary things without 
  being in a hurry. He lives such a life denied to the majority of intellectuals 
  in the modern world: gardening, cooking, being in friendly association with 
  people in a small village, taking a long walk, and sometimes setting out on 
  a pilgrimage to remote countries.</p>
<p>It seems that his everyday social activities, such as editing the magazine, 
  being concerned with the small school and the publishing work, and acting as 
  program director of Schumacher College, are all meditative experiences for him. 
  Probably here lies a source of energy that makes him perform numerous things 
  indefatigably. It is clear that if everything you do in your daily life constitutes 
  the moment of experiencing &quot;nirvana beyond time&quot; just as in milking 
  a cow, each work must be a source of pleasure, far from burdensome duty.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to draw attention to another important thing, that 
  is, Kumar's unique style in writing. Whenever I read his essays and lectures 
  as well as his autobiography, I am amazed at the fact that there are hardly 
  rough and rigid expressions in his speech and writing, and that there are no 
  emotional signs of rancor, enmity or resentment. It seems to me that for him, 
  language is not for criticizing and attacking, but for respecting and serving 
  all creatures in the world.</p>
<p>Even when, in Kumar's writings, occasions arise to criticize or deny something, 
  they are enacted in humorous spirit without any malice. When Kumar talks about 
  the world's political leaders today irresponsibly driving the world into catastrophe, 
  he expresses his wish that they have more time to sleep, in the footstep of 
  an old Islamic sage who, according to a legendary story, in answering to the 
  then king's wish to have a good counsel how to govern the country, asked his 
  king to have more sleep. It is no doubt that the longer the leaders sleep, the 
  less the world will be damaged. When he says so, however, Kumar does not say 
  in a cynical or malicious tone. He is simply revealing his genuine wish that 
  today's political leaders too should be spiritually reborn and become peaceful 
  in their mind.</p>
<p>WHEN PONDERING OVER IT, we can easily arrive at a conclusion that only a peaceful 
  mind is generous enough to be open to him/herself and others. This is not merely 
  true of human relations. The chief reason why the ecosystems-the natural basis 
  of our existence--are increasingly damaged is that our inner life is in trouble 
  and never free. Consequently, we are now all running headlong without knowing 
  our destination. In so doing, we are now going out of breath, risking our life 
  itself.</p>
<p>What is revealed in Satish Kumar's daily life is a healthy and respectable 
  pattern of life, as rarely seen elsewhere. His life seems to be one of the best 
  exemplars in the modern world suggesting what we need most to heal ourselves 
  and to save the natural world from collapsing.</p>
<p>Kumar has practiced life without money from his youth. It was in his twenties 
  that he realized the spiritual significance of &quot;walking.&quot; As early 
  as when he was only 9 years old, he became a member of traveling Jains who practice 
  most radically the doctrine of ahimsa (&quot;Do no harm on living things.&quot;) 
  in separation from the mundane world, following the tradition of his family. 
  About a decade later, he returned to the &quot;world&quot; at the age of 18 
  to follow Gandhi. And, after Gandhi was dead, he joined the social movement 
  led by Vinoba Bhave, the eminent disciple of Gandhi. Vinoba Bhave, one of the 
  most respectable teachers in India at those days, was devoting himself to the 
  land-gifting-movement, persuading rich landowners to give parts of their land 
  to poor landless peasants for nothing. The idea of the land gifting, seemingly 
  an unrealistic dream, was put to practice by Bhave and his followers. They walked 
  across the whole Indian subcontinent for this purpose, and consequently about 
  4 million acres of land were actually given to landless people.</p>
<p>Probably inspired by his predecessors, Satish Kumar initiated &quot;pilgrimage 
  for peace,&quot; walking across continents with one of his friends late in the 
  1960's when the nuclear threat reached its culmination. He was said to be strongly 
  impressed and touched by the news of Bertrand Russell, the grey-haired old philosopher 
  taking the lead in anti-nuclear peace movement. Kumar felt ashamed that he, 
  young man, remained an idle onlooker when the old philosopher was striving for 
  peace. Thereupon, he decided to travel 8000 miles from India through Russia 
  and Europe to America, walking through snowstorms, deserts, mountains, and rivers.</p>
<p>Informed of the young men's decision to walk for peace, Vinoba Bhave extolled 
  them with vigorous and passionate words. At the time of farewell, he offered 
  to them a gift: two weapons of non-violence. One is to travel penniless to the 
  last; the other is to practice vegetarianism anywhere.</p>
<p>Those two weapons based on the philosophy of non-violence turned out to be 
  very effective from the beginning of travel. As the news of two Indian young 
  men making a pilgrimage for peace on foot spread out of itself from mouths to 
  mouths, villages to villages, cities to cities, lands to lands, local residents 
  came to their stop-offs to welcome them. Even when they crossed over the borderland 
  to Pakistan, then in a sharpening conflict with India, Pakistan people were 
  waiting for them to arrive in their concern about food and sleeping place. All 
  these things were made possible because they were traveling on foot without 
  a single penny.</p>
<p>This story about Kumar's walking confirms a fundamental truth in human relationships. 
  That is, people do not usually feel sympathetic with those rich in power or 
  money, and naturally not concerned about them. It is when we witness the adversary 
  situations of the poor and weaker that our compassion is stirred up to help 
  them.</p>
<p>One of the puzzling mysteries of humanity is that once you offer a gift to 
  others, you can feel yourself as if you are a generous and peaceful person, 
  and you can become instantly very happy. Kumar's teacher must have known of 
  this mysterious truth. Thus, the two Indian young men's &quot;walking for peace&quot; 
  without money helped make expanded the space of peace and generosity in the 
  minds of people who provided them with food and sleeping places.</p>
<p>Moreover, whenever at each meal the young men talked about vegetarianism, many 
  people could easily understand the meaning of vegetarianism. For them, the vegetarian 
  diet is no longer a weird habit of cranks, but a noble act of expressing the 
  reverence for life in the world. Suppose somebody is moralizing on the need 
  of the vegetarian diet in high-pitched tone. The sermon would undoubtedly make 
  the listeners sick and tired. But imagine those two young men in respect to 
  people and the foods offered by them are talking about the significance of vegetarianism. 
  It would not be hard to conjecture that their opinion could be easily accepted 
  by the people who had already become ready to listen to their story. In this 
  way, the sympathy and solidarity are increasing among people, and consequently 
  the way for peace is prepared.</p>
<p>IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT, apart from the teacher's ability to foresee 
  what would happen, all these achievements were obviously made possible, first 
  and foremost, by Kumar's own decision to make a walking pilgrimage across continents. 
  Walking is one of the most fundamental foundations on which we set up really 
  peaceful relations between human beings, and between humanity and the natural 
  world. It may be possible that we can drive a car or take airplane to go far 
  away to discuss peace, social justice, and the need to protect ecosystems. But 
  it is clearly impossible to realize genuine peace in the world and at the same 
  time to be permanently dependent on the &quot;modern&quot; transportation systems 
  inherently violent to all the living things. It is certain that there is no 
  peace, social justice, healthy ecosystems without our deep reverence for life, 
  and our reverence for life can be only expressed by our voluntary choice to 
  live a frugal life.</p>
<p>If we are to get closer to the freedom and inner happiness, walking should 
  be a first step. Walking is &quot;an obedient listening&quot; to a Being larger 
  than ourselves, far from the culture of hubris endlessly promoting our selfhood.</p>
