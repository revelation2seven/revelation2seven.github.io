<blockquote> 
  <p><b>APOCALYPTIC ESOTERICISM AND MERKABAH MYSTICISM</b></p>
  <p><b>Chronologically speaking, it is in apocalyptic literature that we find 
    the first appearance of ideas of a specifically mystical character, reserved 
    for the elect. Scholars do not agree on whether the origins of this literature 
    are to found among the Pharisees and their disciples or among the Essenes...It 
    is known from Josephus that the Essenes possessed literature which was both 
    magical and angelogical in content. His silence concerning their apocalyptic 
    ideas can be understood as his desire to conceal this aspect of contemporary 
    Judaism from his gentile readers. The discovery of the literary remains of 
    the Qumran sect shows that such ideas found a haven among them. They possessed 
    the original BOOK OF ENOCH, both in Hebrew and Aramaic...Traditions resembling 
    those embedded in the Book of Enoch found their way into rabbinic Judaism 
    at the time of the &quot;tannaim&quot; and &quot;amoraim&quot; (from the latter 
    part of the first century to the fifth century and later), and it is impossible 
    to determine precisely the breeding ground of this type of tradition until 
    the problems presented by the discovery of the Qumran writings have been solved...</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The teachings were brought over to the Pharisaic, or Lunar 
  side of the Tree of Life by the Essenes in the first century. They came over 
  in the name of the original Jochannan ben Zakkai (John the son of Zachariah) 
  by John's disciple, the first Simeon bar Jochi (Simon Peter, the disciple or 
  son of Jochannan). The names and the teachings were received by the Pharisees 
  (according to History's great plan), and subsequently found their way into the 
  later writings and kabbalistic speculations of rabbinic Judaism. It was the 
  <i>tanna</i> Elisha ben Abuyah (whom the world knows as the apostle Paul), who 
  brought in the Central European doctrine of <i>Christ Hesus and Him Crucified</i>. 
  Thus it was said of him that <i>he saw the Metatron and cut the shoots, </i>giving 
  rise to the Christian mysteries which in time seemed inimical in the eyes of 
  some to the Judaism out of which they were born. It was later recorded that 
  Elisha, or <i>Acher</i> as as he was called, became a heretic and a dualist, 
  because he said &quot;Instead of One perhaps there are Two.&quot; (Please see

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Scholem continued)...</font><b>The 
    Book of Enoch was followed by apocalyptic writings up to the time of the tannaim, 
    and, in different ways even later. Esoteric knowledge in these books touched 
    not only upon the revelation of the end of time and its awesome terrors, but 
    also upon the structure of the hidden world and its inhabitants: heaven, the 
    Garden of Eden, and Gehinnom, angels and evil spirits, and the fate of the 
    souls in this hidden world. Above this are revelations concerning the Throne 
    of Glory and its Occupant, which should apparently be identified with &quot;WONDERFUL 
    SECRETS OF GOD&quot; mentioned by the Dead Sea Scrolls. Here a link can be 
    established between this literature and the much later traditions concerning 
    the &quot;ma'seh bereshit&quot; and the &quot;ma'seh merkabah.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>The mysteries of the Throne constitute here a particularly exalted subject 
    which to a large extent set the patterns for the early form of Jewish mysticism. 
    It did not aspire to an understanding of the true nature of God, but to a 
    perception of the phenomenon of the Throne on its Chariot as it is described 
    in the first chapter of Ezekiel, traditionally entitled &quot;ma'seh merkabah.&quot; 
    The mysteries of the world of the Throne, together with those of the Divine 
    Glory which is revealed there, are the parallels in Jewish esoteric tradition 
    to the revelations on the realm of the divine in Gnosticism. The 14th chapter 
    of the Book of Enoch, which contains the earliest example of this kind of 
    literary description, , was the source of a long visionary tradition of describing 
    the world of the Throne and the visionary ascent to it, which we find portrayed 
    in the books of the merkabah mystics. In addition to interpretations, visions, 
    and speculations based on the &quot;ma'seh merkabah&quot;, other esoteric 
    traditions began to crystallize round THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS, which 
    was called&quot;ma'seh bereshit.&quot; These two terms were subsequently used 
    to describe those subjects dealing with these topics. </b></p>
  <p><b>Both Mishna and Talmud (Hag.2:1 and the corresponding Gemara in both the 
    Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud) show that, in the first century of the common 
    era, esoteric traditions existed within these areas, and severe limitations 
    were placed on public discussion of such subjects: &quot;The story of Creation 
    should not be expounded before two persons, nor the chapter on the Chariot 
    before one person, unless he is a sage and already has an independent understanding 
    of the matter.&quot; Evidence concerning the involvement of Johannan b. Zakkai 
    and his disciples in this sort of exposition proves that this esotericism 
    could grow in the very center of a developing rabbinic Judaism, and that consequently 
    this Judaism had a particular esoteric aspect from its very beginning. On 
    the other hand, it is possible that the rise of Gnostic speculations, which 
    were not accepted by the rabbis, made many of them tread very warily and adopt 
    a polemic attitude. Such an attitude is expressed in the continuation of the 
    Mishna quoted above&quot; &quot;Whoever ponders on Four things, it were better 
    for him if he had not come into the world: what is above, what is below, what 
    was before time, and what will be hereafter.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>Merkabah terminology is found in a hymn-fragment in the Dead Sea Scrolls, 
    where the angels praise &quot;the image of the Throne of the Chariot...From 
    the very beginning these traditions were surrounded by an aura of particular 
    sanctity. Talmudic aggadah connects exposition of the Merkabah with THE DESCENT 
    OF FIRE FROM ABOVE which surrounds the expositor....Other and more daring 
    expressions are used to describe the ecstatic and emotional character of these 
    experiences. Distinct from the exposition of the Merkabah...was the ecstatic 
    contemplation of the Merkabah experienced AS AN ASCENT TO THE HEAVENS, namely 
    &quot;DESCENT TO THE MERKABAH,&quot; through entering &quot;pards&quot; <a href="Paradise.htm">(paradise)</a>. 
    This was not a matter for exposition and interpretation but of vision and 
    personal experience. This transition, which once again connects the revelations 
    of the Merkabah with the apocalyptic tradition, is mentioned in the Talmud 
    alongside the exegetic traditions. (Hag 14b). It concerns the Four sages who 
    &quot;entered pards.&quot; Their fate demonstrates that here we are dealing 
    with spiritual experiences which were achieved by contemplation and ecstasy. 
    Simeon b. Azzai &quot;looked and died&quot;; Ben Zoma &quot;looked and was 
    smitten&quot; (mentally); Elisha b. Avuyah, called Aher (&quot;other&quot;), 
    forsook rabbinic Judaism and &quot;cut the shoots,&quot; apparently becoming 
    a dualistic Gnostic; R. Akiva alone &quot;entered in peace and left in peace,&quot; 
    or in another reading, &quot;ascended in peace and descended in peace.&quot; 
    (Rabbi Akiva ascended in peace and descended in peace, because he didn't look, 
    he didn't inquire, and therefore didn't see any more than it was given to 
    him to see). So R. Akiva, a central figure in the world of rabbinic Judaism, 
    is also the legitimate representative of a mysticism within its boundaries...</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;Mention of the Essene hopes of a New Age of glory leads us naturally 
    to some comments on the special theological views of the Essenes that informed 
    their understanding of history and gave to their community its peculiar institutions. 
    The Essenes belong in the center of that movement (known as) apocalypticism. 
    The late visionaries of the Old Testament, notably the author of Daniel, as 
    well as the later Baptist and Christian communities, discovered themselves 
    to be living in the last days of the Old Age, or rather in the days when the 
    Old Age was passing away and the Kingdom of God was dawning. According to 
    apocalypticism, the upsurge of evil powers in the world reflected the last 
    defiant outbreak of cosmic Satanic powers. The gifts of the Holy Spirit manifest 
    in the community of the faithful, adumbrated the age of the Spirit to follow 
    the final war in which the Spirit of Truth and his heavenly armies would put 
    an end to the rule of the powers of Darkness. The constitution of the Essene 
    community was a crystallized apocalyptic vision. Each institution and practise 
    of the community was a preparation for or, by anticipation, a realization 
    of, life in the New Age of God's rule. ON THE ONE HAND, THEIR COMMUNAL LIFE 
    WAS A REENACTMENT OF THE EVENTS OF THE END TIMES, both the final days of the 
    Old Age AND the era of Armageddon. (An understanding that is reflected everywhere 
    in the Gospel narratives). On the other hand, their community, being heirs 
    of the kingdom, participated already in the gifts and glories that were the 
    first fruits of the Age to come. For the apocalypticists of Qumran the key 
    to these future mysteries was At Hand. One had only to read biblical prophecies 
    with the understanding given the inspired interpreter (that is, one who reads 
    with the power of the Holy Spirit) because the secrets of events to come in 
    the last days were foretold by God through the mouth of the holy prophets&#133;</b></p>
  <p><b>In apocalyptic exegesis, three principles should be kept in mind. Prophecy 
    openly or cryptically refers to the last days. Second, the so-called last 
    days are in fact (in types and figures) the present, the days of the sect's 
    life. And finally, the history of ancient Israel's redemption, her offices 
    and institutions, are prototypes of the events and figures of the New Israel. 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>On this basis, the Essene camp in the wilderness found its prototype in 
    the Mosaic camp of Numbers (Numbers 2 to 4; 9:15-10:28). The Essenes retired 
    to Qumran to 'prepare the way of the Lord' in the wilderness. As God established 
    His ancient covenant in the desert, so the Essenes entered into a New Covenant 
    on their return to the desert. As Israel in the desert was mustered into army 
    ranks in preparation for the Holy War of Conquest, so the Essenes marshaled 
    their community in battle array and wrote liturgies of the Holy Warfare of 
    Armageddon.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Understanding

    Origin of the Conception. </b></p>
  <p><b>The Heavenly Throne; hence &quot;Ma'aseh Merkabah,&quot; the lore concerning 
    the heavenly Throne-Chariot, with especial reference to Ezek. i. and x. The 
    conception of Yhwh riding upon cherubim, or fiery cloud-birds, upon the heavens 
    or the clouds, is certainly genuinely Hebrew (see Ps. xviii. 11 [A. V. 10]; 
    Deut. xxxiii. 26; Ps. lxviii. 5 [A. V. 4]; Isa. xix. 1); hence His &quot;war-chariot&quot; 
    (Hab. iii. 8 and Isa. lxvi. 15, Hebr.) and the name &quot;chariot&quot; for 
    the ark with the cherubim (I Chron. xxviii. 18). Just as the Assyrian sunchariot 
    with its horses is employed in the legend of the ride of Elijah to heaven 
    (II Kings ii. 11; comp. Enoch lxx. 2, lxxii. 5, lxxiii. 2), so did the prophet 
    Ezekiel in his vision, probably suggested by Babylonian sculpture, see Yhwh 
    riding on the Throne-Chariot when leaving the doomed Temple at Jerusalem (see 
    M&uuml;ller, &quot;Ezechielstudien,&quot; 1895, pp. 8-11; Bertholet, &quot;Das 
    Buch Hezekiel,&quot; 1897, p. 12). To a later age Ezekiel's picture became 
    a sacred mystery known by the term &quot;Merkabah&quot; as early as the time 
    of Ben Sira (Ecclus. xlix. 8). The ancient Mishnah lays down the rule: &quot;The 
    Ma'aseh Merkabah should not be taught to any one except he be wise and able 
    to deduce knowledge through wisdom ('gnosis') of his own&quot; (?ag. ii. 1). 
    Job beheld the throne of God, and his daughters sang the doxology of the Ma'aseh 
    Merkabah (according to the Testament of Job, ed. Kohler, vii. 39, xi. 25; 
    see Kohut Memorial Volume, pp. 282, 288). Quite characteristic is the story 
    given in Tosef., ?ag. ii. 1; ?ag. 14b; Yer. ?ag. ii. 77a:(p?e?&micro;at????; 
    see Jo&euml;l, &quot;Blicke in die Religionsgeschichte,&quot; 1880, pp. 133-135). 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;R. Eleazar ben 'Arak was riding on a mule behind R. JOHANAN B. ZAKKAI, 
    when he asked for the privilege of being initiated into the secrets of the 
    Merkabah. The great master demanded proof of his initiation into the gnosis, 
    and when Eleazar began to tell what he had learned thereof, R. Johanan immediately 
    descended from the mule and sat upon the rock. 'Why, O master, dost thou descend 
    from the mule?' asked the disciple. 'Can I remain mounted upon the mule when 
    the telling of the secrets of the Merkabah causes the Shekinah to dwell with 
    us and the angels to accompany us?' was the answer. Eleazar continued, and, 
    behold, fire descended from heaven and lit up the trees of the field, causing 
    them to sing anthems, and an angel cried out, 'Truly these are the secrets 
    of the Merkabah.' Whereupon R. Johanan kissed Eleazar upon the forehead, saying, 
    'Blessed be thou, O father Abraham, that hast a descendant like Eleazar b. 
    'Arak!' Subsequently two other disciples of R. Johanan b. Zakkai walking together 
    said to each other: 'Let us also talk together about the Ma'aseh Merkabah'; 
    and no sooner did R. Joshua begin speaking than a rainbow-like appearance 
    [Ezek. i. 28] was seen upon the thick clouds which covered the sky, and angels 
    came to listen as men do to hear wedding-music. On hearing the things related 
    by R. Jose, R. Johanan b. Zakkai blessed his disciples and said: 'Blessed 
    the eyes that beheld these things! Indeed I saw myself in a dream together 
    with you, seated like the select ones [comp. Ex. xxiv. 11] upon Mount Sinai; 
    and I heard a heavenly voice saying: &quot;Enter the banquet-hall and take 
    your seats with your disciples and disciples' disciples, among the elect, 
    the highest ('third') class&quot;'&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Symbolic Significance.</b></p>
  <p><b>Obviously this is a description of an ecstatic state in which the pictures 
    that the mind forms are beheld as realities (comp. Tosef., Meg. iv. 28 and 
    Meg. 24&#151;&quot;Blind ones saw them&quot;). The study of the Merkabah was 
    theosophy; to the initiated the ?ayyot and the Ofannim around the Heavenly 
    Throne became beings that lived and moved before their eyes (see Jo&euml;l, 
    l.c. p. 152). It was in fact considered perilous to penetrate into these mysteries. 
    &quot;A youth who studied the '?ashmal' [Ezek. i. 27, Hebr.] was consumed 
    by the fire which sprang forth from it&quot; (?ag. 13a; comp. Shab. 80a). 
    Only the older men dared to be initiated into those mysteries. &quot;I am 
    not old enough,&quot; said R. Eleazar when R. Johanan b. Nappa?a wished to 
    instruct him in them. They were to be imparted in suggestions (&quot;initial 
    sentences,&quot; &quot;rashe pera?im&quot;) rather than in complete chapters 
    (?ag. 13a). &quot;The bird that flew over the head of Jonathan b. Uzziel as 
    he studied them was consumed by the fire surrounding him&quot; (Suk. 28a; 
    comp. Meg. 3a). &quot;Ben 'Azzai was seated meditating on the Torah, when, 
    behold, a flame encircled him; the people told R. A?iba, and he went to Ben 
    'Azzai, saying, 'Art thou studying the mysteries of the Merkabah?'&quot; (Cant. 
    R. i. 10; Lev. R. xvi.). &quot;IN THE FUTURE EZEKIEL (the son of man) WILL 
    COME AGAIN AND UNLOCK FOR ISRAEL THE CHAMBERS OF THE MERKABAH&quot; (Cant. 
    R. i. 4).</b></p>
  <p><b>Glimpses of the mysteries of the Merkabah may be discerned in such rabbinical 
    sayings as the following: &quot;The angel Sandalfon towers above the rest 
    of the angels the length of a five hundred years' journey; his feet touch 
    the earth while his head reaches the holy ?ayyot. He stands behind the Throne-Chariot 
    binding wreaths for his Master&quot; (?ag. 13b). To R. Ishmael b. Elisha is 
    ascribed the saying that when offering the incense in the Temple as high priest 
    he beheld the angel Akatriel (&quot;the wreath-binding one&quot;; Sandalfon?) 
    seated on the Throne and asked him for a blessing (Ber. 7a; comp. Bacher, 
    &quot;Ag. Tan.&quot; i. 267). One of these great archangels is said to equal 
    in size a third part of the world (Ex. R. iii.). Concerning the lion, the 
    ox, the eagle, and the man as the four faces of the ?ayyot, see ?ag. 13b; 
    on account of these four, which carry God's Throne-Chariot, the latter is 
    called also &quot;Tetramoulon&quot;=&quot;Quadriga&quot; (Ex. R. iii. 3; comp. 
    Jellinek, &quot;B. H.&quot; iii. 92-95).</b></p>
  <p><b>In the Enoch Literature.</b></p>
  <p><b>The Merkabah mysteries, which remained the exclusive property of the initiated 
    ones, the &quot;?enu'im&quot; or &quot;?ashsha'im&quot; (see Essenes), have 
    been preserved chiefly in the Enoch literature of the pre-Christian centuries, 
    and in the &quot;Hekalot&quot; of the geonic time, known also as the &quot;Merkabah&quot;

    the &quot;payye?an-?edushshah&quot; literature and has found its way also 
    into other ancient apocrypha, such as the Testament of Abraham, the Ascensio 
    Isai&aelig;, etc. Besides the descriptions of the seven heavens with their 
    hosts of angels, and the various storehouses of the world, and of the divine 
    throne above the highest heaven, the most remarkable feature is that the mysteries 
    rest on the belief in the reality of the things seen in an ecstatic state 
    brought about by ablutions, fasts, fervent invocations, incantations, and 
    by other means. This is called &quot;the Vision of the Merkabah&quot; (&quot;?efiyat 
    ha-Merkabah&quot;), and those under this strange hallucination, who imagine 
    themselves entering the Heavenly Chariot and floating through the air, are 
    called &quot;Yorede Merkabah&quot; (&quot;those that go down into the ship-like 
    chariot&quot;; Jellinek, &quot;B. H.&quot; iii. 90, 94 et seq.). In this chariot 
    they are supposed to ascend to the heavens, where in the dazzling light surrounding 
    them they behold the innermost secrets of all persons and things, otherwise 
    impenetrable and invisible.</b></p>
  <p><b>Particularly significant is the warrior-nature of the angels surrounding 
    the Throne-Chariot; flames dart forth from their eyes; they ride upon fiery 
    horses (comp. Zech. vi. 1-8) and are armed with weapons of fire (Jellinek, 
    l.c.). In order to be allowed to pass these terrible beings the Merkabahrider 
    must provide himself with amulets or seals containing mysterious names (&quot;Hekalot,&quot; 
    l.c.xvii.-xxii., xxx.), and in order to be able to step before the Throne 
    he must recite certain prayers until God Himself addresses him, if he be worthy. 
    The &quot;Hekalot&quot; mention especially either R. A?iba or R. Ishmael, 
    and their associates of the Bar Kokba time, as types of the &quot;Yorede Merkabah.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>The central figure and chief actor in the theophany, however, is the &quot;Prince 
    of the Face,&quot; Metatron, the one next to the Throne, whose name, or whose 
    seventy names, are like God's, and who is none else than Enoch translated 
    to heaven and transformed into the highest angel. He is the one who imparted 
    to man all the knowledge of heaven and of the past and the future (see especially 
    Jellinek, l.c. v. 170-176), exactly as Enoch did in the Ethiopic and Slavonic 
    Books of Enoch.</b></p>

  <p><b>Origin of the Conception.</b></p>
  <p><b>Concerning the origin of the Merkabah-ride, Jellinek (&quot;B. H.&quot; 
    iii. p. xxii.) expressed the opinion that Persian Sufism gave rise to its 
    peculiar notions, and Bloch (&quot;Monatsschrift,&quot; 1893, pp. 18-25, 69-74, 
    257-266, 305-311) endeavored to trace them all back to Arabic mysticism. But 
    recent researches concerning the Mithra worship and the Mithra liturgy have 
    cast altogether new light on the whole Merkabah lore. Mithra, the heavenly 
    charioteer, with his Quadriga, a chariot drawn by four horses, who was worshiped 
    in ancient Persia as the god of light and regarded in early Roman times as 
    the prime mover of the world, formed of the four elements (Dio Chrysostomus, 
    &quot;Oratio,&quot; xxxvi.; see Cumont, &quot;Die Mysterien des Mithra,&quot; 
    1903, pp. 87-88; Windischmann, &quot;Zoroastrische Studien,&quot; 1863, pp. 
    309-312), was invoked under mysterious rites as the mediator between the inaccessible 
    and unknowable Deity, in the ethereal regions of light, and man on earth (Cumont, 
    l.c. pp. 95, 122). These rites bear such a striking resemblance to those by 
    means of which the Merkabah-riders approached the Deity that there can scarcely 
    be any doubt as to the Mithraic origin of the latter (see Dieterich, &quot;Eine 
    Mithrasliturgie,&quot; 1903, pp. 7-15). The only difference between them is 
    that while the Mithra-worshipers, at least those of Roman times, had the coming 
    forth of Mithra as the highest god their aim, the Merkabah-riders have the 
    seeing of the Lord on high as their goal, Metatron-Mithra, the archangel, 
    being the divine charioteer who ushers them into the presence of God. Otherwise 
    there is the same hallucination at work which makes the ecstatic imagine that 
    he is lifted up from the earth to heaven to see the sun, stars, and winds 
    come forth from their places; to behold the sun (or sun-god) and the entire 
    celestial household, the seven rulers of the celestial poles, or the archangels; 
    and finally to gaze at the luminous youthful Mithra in all his beauty&#151;the 
    youthful Me?a?ron of the Jewish mystics (see Cumont, l.c. pp. 117, 151, et 
    al.).</b></p>
  <p><b>Such spiritualistic experiences through mystic rites had their origin 
    in Egypt rather than in Persia. Jamblichus (&quot;De Mysteriis,&quot; iii. 
    4, 5) describes the optic and acoustic illusions under which the Egyptian 
    mystic labored as if they were realities, and at the same time he states that 
    in the ecstatic state brought about by magic songs and proper environment 
    the soul is encompassed by a chariot of light and ether on which it beholds 
    the heavenly things in the light reflected from above (iii. 14; see Von Harless, 
    &quot;Das Buch von der Aegyptischen Mysterien,&quot; pp. 53-54, 65-66). Neoplatonic 
    ideas, accordingly, aided in rendering the Mithra worship the center of the 
    mystic belief in which the world of antiquity sought relief during the period 
    when the gods of classical antiquity were losing their authority and divinity; 
    and Jewish wisdom, following the tendency of the age, embodied it, under the 
    name of Enoch Me?a?ron, as secret lore in its system (see Me?a?ron).</b></p>
  <p><b>Philo took the idea of the Merkabah with its charioteer Metatron AND APPLIED 
    IT TO HIS LOGOS (&quot;De Somniis,&quot; i. 25; &quot;Quis Rerum Divinarum 
    Heres Sit,&quot; &sect;&sect; 42, 48; &quot;De Profugis,&quot; &sect; 19; 
    &quot;De Confusione Linguarum,&quot; &sect; 28; &quot;De Monarchia,&quot; 
    i. 1; comp. Plato, &quot;Ph&aelig;drus,&quot; ii. 46). Maimonides (&quot;Moreh 
    Nebukim,&quot; iii. 1-7), in his antagonism to mysticism, went so far as to 
    dissolve the whole Merkabah theophany of Ezekiel into mere physics, notwithstanding 
    the rabbinical warning against disclosing these mysteries (see Pes. 119a). 
    All the stronger, therefore, grew the zeal of the mystics, as is evidenced 
    in the renewed form of the Cabala, which lent to the Merkabah lore and all 
    the ecstatic visions and mystic operations connected therewith new life and 
    vigor; of this the Book of Raziel and the later Cabala are ample proof. See 
    Ma'aseh Bereshit.K.</b></p>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE BOOKS OF ENOCH</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Books of Enoch - Introduction</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most prolific descriptions of 
  the Chariot appear in the Books of Enoch. Enochian literature takes its name 
  from Enoch, son of Yared. Enoch was &quot;a righteous man in his generation&quot; 
  and &quot;walked with Elohim.&quot; It is believed that in ancient times there 
  may have been as many as 100,000 volumes of Enochian literature, nearly all 
  of whose last remains were lost in the fiery destruction of the Great Library 
  of Alexandria. This literature was virtually unknown from the fourth (when banned 
  by Hilary, Jerome, and Augustus...Augustine?) until the late nineteenth century 
  CE, when three manuscripts deemed as authentic Enochian material were discovered. 
  Two of the manuscripts, I Enoch and III Enoch, were in Ethiopian translation: 
  these were found in what was once Abyssinia, the domain of King Solomon's infamous 
  lover, the Queen of Sheba. The third manuscript, II Enoch, known as the &quot;Book 
  of the Secrets of Enoch&quot;, was preserved in two Slavonic versions: these 
  were found in Russia and Serbia. I Enoch and II Enoch were translated by R.H. 
  Charles. H. Odeburg translated III Enoch (&quot;Hebrew Book of Enoch&quot;). 
  The Books of Enoch that are mentioned here should not be confused with the &quot;Canons 
  of Enoch,&quot; which were discovered and translated into European languages 
  in the early nineteenth century. These latter books, which influenced Romantic 
  artists and poets such as Thomas Moore, William Blake, and Lord Byron, are from 
  a different tradition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The authorship and dates of origin 
  of the remaining Enochian books are obscure. The three manuscripts cited, replete 
  with errors of addition, corruption, and omission, may well be the remnants 
  of volumes given to Sheba by King Solomon </font>(This affair is an apocryphal 
  story)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> and subsequently handed down 
  through generations. At the very least, biblical scholars agree that the Books 
  of Enoch are the most important Apocrypha and Pseudoepigrapha pre-dating the 
  Christian era. It has been well established that all New Testament authors were 
  more or less influenced by them. The translations of the three Books of Enoch 
  had been long out of print by the time the Work of the Chariot republished them 
  in the early 1970's.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The texts address a wide range of 
  topics: there are numerous messianic references, extensive angeologies and demonologies, 
  elaborate descriptions of the various heavens and hells, lists of Divine Names, 
  lists of names of Metatron, and allusions to mystical states associated with 
  ascending the Tree. The most prominent Chariot sections describe the ascension 
  and transformation of Enoch ben Yared into Metatron, known as &quot;The Youth&quot; 
  (Nar) to whom the Lord YHVH revealed the deepest secrets, and whom the Lord 
  YHVH made the &quot;operational manager&quot; of this universe. Metatron, chief 
  of the angels, is referred to in the Tanakh (notably in Proverbs 22.6 and Job 
  32.6), as well as the Zohar (I.223b). III Enoch, the &quot;Hebrew Book of Enoch,&quot; 
  contains a long discourse on the ascension of the Celestial Chariot by Rabbi 
  Ishmael, the last High Priest before the destruction of the first Temple of 
  Jerusalem. The ascension of Rabbi Ishmael drew vigorous protests from some of 
  the high angels, who objected to the admission of his relatively impure human 
  spirit to the supernal World of Emanation (Atziluth). When high angels get too 
  close to the supernal Sefiroth in the World of Emanation, their wings burn: 
  perhaps they were envious? The ascension by Rabbi Ishmael of the Celestial Chariot 
  is a narrative allegory for the mystical ascent of the Central Column of the 
  Tree. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And from thence I went to another 
  place... And he showed me a mountain range of fire that burnt day and night.<br>
  And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent mountains, all differing from 
  the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and beautiful, magnificent 
  as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior. Three towards the east, 
  one founded on the other, and three towards the south, one upon the other, and 
  deep ravines no one of which joined with any other. AND THE SEVENTH MOUNTAIN 
  WAS IN THE MIDST OF THESE, AND IT EXCELLED THEM IN HEIGHT, RESEMBLING THE SEAT 
  OF A THRONE</font></p>

  was any amongst them nor were others like it. It had a fragrance beyond all 
  fragrance, and its leaves and wood wither not forever. And its fruit is beautiful 
  and its fruit resembles the dates of palm. Then I said: &quot;HOW BEAUTIFUL 
  IS THIS TREE, and fragrant, and its leaves are fair, and its blooms very delightful 
  in appearance.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then answered Michael 
  one of the holy and honored angels who was with me, and was their leader. And 
  he said to me: &quot;Enoch, why dost thou ask me regarding the fragrance of 
  the tree, and why dost thou wish to learn the truth?&quot; Then I answered to 
  him saying: &quot;I WISH TO KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING, BUT ESPECIALLY THIS TREE.&quot; 
  And he answered saying: &quot;This high mountain that thou hast seen, whose 
  summit is like the Throne of God, is His Throne, where the Holy Great One, the 
  Lord of Glory, the Eternal King will sit, when He shall come down to visit the 
  earth with goodness. AND AS FOR THIS FRAGRANT TREE, NO MORTAL IS PERMITTED TO 
  TOUCH IT TILL THE GREAT JUDGMENT, when He shall take vengeance on all, and bring 
  (everything) to its consummation forever. It shall then be given to the righteous 
  and holy. Its fruits shall be for food to the elect; IT SHALL BE TRANSPLANTED

  to me and greeted me with His voice, and said unto me: &quot;This is the Son

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;IN THE TENTH HEAVEN, THE ARCHANGEL 
  MICHAEL LED ENOCH BEFORE THE FACE OF THE LORD.&quot;<br>
  On the tenth heaven, Araboth, I saw the appearance of the Lord YHVH's Face, 
  like iron made to glow in fire, and brought out, emitting sparks, and it burns. 
  Thus I saw the Lord YHVH's Face, but the Lord YHVH's Face is ineffable, marvelous 
  and very awful, and very, very terrible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And who am I to tell of the Lord 
  YHVH's unspeakable being, and of His very wonderful Face? And I cannot tell 
  the quantity of His many instructions, and various voices; the Lord YHVH's throne 
  very great and not made with hands; nor the quantity of those standing round 
  Him, troops of Kerubim, and Serafim, nor their incessant singing, nor His immutable 
  beauty. And who shall tell of the ineffable greatness of His glory?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I fell prone, and could see the 
  Lord YHVH as NOT (Lo). And I bowed down to the Lord YHVH, and the Lord YHVH 
  spoke unto Michael: &quot;Take Enoch, and take him out of his earthly garments, 
  and anoint him with sweet oil, and clothe him in the garments of My glory.&quot; 
  And Michael took me out from my (earthly) garments, and anointed me with sweet 
  oil; and the appearance of that oil is better than great light, and his ointment 
  is like the sweet dew, and its smell like myrrh, and shines like the rays of 
  the sun.</font></p>

  YHVH told him. And I looked at myself, and I was like one of His glorious ones.

  me and said, &quot;Have courage Enoch, fear not, arise and stand before My AL-Face

  the door of the Seventh Hall, I stood still in prayer before the Holy One, blessed 
  be He, and lifting up my eyes on high (i.e. toward the Divine Majesty), I said:<br>
  3. &quot;Lord of the Universe, I pray thee, that the merit OF AARON, son of 
  Amram, the LOVER OF PEACE AND PURSUER OF PEACE, who received the crown of priesthood 
  from The Glory on the mount of Sinai, be valid for me in this hour, so that 
  Qafsiel, the prince, and the angels with him may not get power over me nor throw 
  me down from the heavens.&quot;<br>
  4. Forthwith the Holy One, blessed be He, sent me to Metatron, His servant, 
  the angel, the Prince of the Presence; and he, spreading his wings, with great 
  joy came to meet me so as to save me from their hand.<br>
  5. And he took by his hand in their sight, saying to me: &quot;Enter in peace 
  before the high and exalted King and behold the vision of the Chariot.&quot;<br>
  6. Then I entered the Seventh Hall, and he led me to the camp(s) of Shekhinah 
  and placed me before the Holy One, blessed be He, to behold the Chariot. <br>
  7. As soon as the princes of the Chariot and the flaming Serafim perceived me, 
  they fixed their eyes upon me. Instantly trembling and shuddering seized me 
  and I fell down and was benumbed by the radiant image of their eyes and the 
  splendid appearance of their faces; until the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked 
  them saying:<br>
  8. &quot;My servants, my Serafim, my Kerubim, and my Ofanim! Cover ye your eyes 
  before Ishmael, my son, my friend, my beloved one and my glory, that he tremble 
  not nor shudder!&quot;<br>
  9. Forthwith Metatron, the Prince of the Presence, came and restored my spirit 
  and put me U[PON MY FEET.<br>
  10. After that (moment) there was not in me strength enough to say a song before 
  the Throne of Glory of the Glorious King, the mightiest of all kings, the most 
  excellent of all princes, until after the hour had passed.<br>
  11. After one hour (had passed) the Holy One, blessed be He, opened to me the 
  gates of the Shekhinah, the gates of Peace, the gates of Wisdom, the gates of 
  Strength, the gates of Power, the gates of Speech, the gates of Song, the gates 
  of Qedusha, and the gates of Chant.<br>
  12. And he enlightened my eyes and my heart by words of psalm, song, praise, 
  exaltation, thanksgiving, extolment, glorification, hymn, and eulogy. And as 
  I opened my mouth, uttering a song before the Holy One, blessed be He, the Holy 
  Chayot beneath and above the Throne of Glory answered and said: &quot;Holy&quot; 
  and &quot;Blessed be the glory of the Lord YHVH from His Place!&quot; (i.e. 
  chanted the &quot;Qedusha&quot;).</font></p>

  &quot; Why art thou called by the Name of Thy Creator, by seventy Names? Thou 
  art greater than all the princes, higher than all the angels, beloved more than 
  all the servants, honored above all the mighty ones in kingship, greatness, 
  and glory. Why do they call thee 'Youth' in the high heavens?&quot;<br>
  2. He answered me and said to me: &quot;Because I am Enoch, the son of Yared.&quot;<br>
  3. &quot;For when the generations of the Flood sinned and were confounded in 
  their deeds, saying unto God (Job 21.14): &quot;Depart from us, for we desire 
  not the knowledge of Thy ways.&quot; Then the Holy One, blessed be He, removed 
  me from their midst to be a witness against them in the high heavens to all 
  the inhabitants of the world, that they may not say: &quot;The Merciful One 
  is cruel'.&quot;<br>
  4. Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, lifted me up in their lifetime before 
  their eyes to be a witness against them to the future world. And the Holy One, 
  blessed be He, assigned me as a prince and a ruler among the ministering angels.<br>
  5. In that hour three of the ministering angels, Uzza, Azza, and Azzael came 
  forth and brought charges against me in the high heavens, saying before the 
  Holy One, blessed be He: &quot;Said not the Ancient Ones (First Ones) rightly 
  before Thee: Do not create man!&quot;<br>
  The Holy One, blessed be He, answered and said unto them (Isaiah 46.4): &quot;I 
  have made and I will bear, yea, I will carry and will deliver.&quot;<br>
  6. As soon as they saw me, they said before Him: &quot;Lord of the Universe! 
  What is this one that he should ascend to the height of heights? Is he not one 
  from among the sons of (the sons of) those who perished in the days of the Flood? 
  What doeth he in the Firmament (raqia)?&quot; <br>
  7. Again the Holy One, blessed be He, answered and said to them: &quot;What 
  are ye, that ye enter and speak in My Presence? I delight in this one more than 
  in all of you, and hence he shall be a prince and a ruler over you in the high 
  heavens.&quot;<br>
  8. Forthwith all stood up and went out to meet me, prostrated themselves before 
  me and said: &quot;Happy art thou and happy is thy father for thy Creator doth 
  favor thee.&quot;<br>
  9. And because I am small and a youth among them in days, months, and years, 
  therefore they call me &quot;Youth&quot; (Na'ar).</font></p>

  5. &quot;And every command that he utters to you in My Name do ye observe and

  contain considerable addenda whose language points to the Hasmonean period, 
  circa 130 BCE, and later. The additional material was left out of the redaction 
  the WC used as the basis for its translation. Based upon astronomical information 
  in the book itself, the WC translator attributes authorship of the Book of Formation 
  to Master Abraham in the nineteenth century BCE. An adjunctive note to the WC 
  translation points out that the Procession of the Equinoxes acts as an unforgeable 
  clock, allowing us to determine that the correspondence of the constellations 
  given in the sixth chapter to the twelve Hebrew months (with no variations in 
  the six texts considered) occurred during the time of Abraham, circa 4000 years 
  ago. Allowing for an optimal variation of plus or minus 800 years ago, it is 
  still not anywhere within the range of medieval times. A check on the data logs 
  of the old Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Greeks indicated that no one had astronomical 
  knowledge of the Procession (until about 1700 CE).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Book of Formation is the first 
  mystical manual on, and possibly the source text for, the original Hebrew alphabet. 
  Its chapters explain the significance of the twenty-two letters, and ascribe 
  various attributions to them. It is second only to the Sefer HaShmoth (Book 
  of the Names) as the most prolific source of distinct forms of the Tree of Life. 
  The first chapter of the book is the earliest known textual source for the six-pointed 
  symbol known as the Star of David.&quot; The Six-Pointed Star has come to be 
  seen as a flat, two-dimensional symbol of two interlocking triangles. The Book 
  of Formation, however, presents the Star as a three-dimensional, six-pointed 
  form of the Tree of Life comprised of two interfacing pyramids. The Book of 
  Formation provides one of the two vastly different sets of names commonly found 
  in the Qabalah for the spheres (called Sefiroth) on the Tree (the other set 
  comes from the Sefer HaZohar, the Book of Splendor). The names for the Sefiroth 
  in the Book of Formation are based on elements (Spirit of Living Elohim, Air, 
  Fire, Water), on four &quot;Celestial Heads of Messiah,&quot; and on the six 
  directions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like the three innermost core texts 
  of the Book of Splendor, the Book of Formation stands out within primary qabalistic 
  literature for the depth, terseness, and obscurity of its language, and for 
  its wealth of mystical allusions. For a Mystical Qabalist, the book's power 
  and value are valid independent of academic considerations regarding its origins. 
  The full range of ideas and allusions presented in the Book of Formation will 
  be discussed in the course of this book.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hooks and their pillars shall 
  be made of silver. (Torah Shmoth 27:17)<br>
  Said Rabbi Yitzaq: I presume that the hooks of the pillars symbolize all those 
  who are attached to the supernal unifying pillars, And that all those who are 
  below depend on them.<br>
  What is the significance of the word Vavim? Six within six, all united and nourished 
  by the Circle which is set over them. And we have learned in the Sifra Detzniyutha 
  this dictum: &quot;the supernal Vav and the inferior Vav ,&quot; All comprehended 
  in ONE meaning and ONE Name, Having one and the same significance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, what is the Sifra Detzniyutha?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Said Rabbi Shimeon: Five chapters 
  which are comprised in a Great Hall and fill the whole Earth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Said Rabbi Yehudah: If they are so 
  comprehensive, they are better than all!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Said Rabbi Shimeon: Verily, it is 
  so for him who enters and comes out; And it is NOT for him who enters NOT and 
  comes out. This is comparable to a person whose dwelling was among the mountains, 
  and he (she) knew no townsfolk. He used to sow wheat and ate the wheat grains 
  as they are. One day he entered the town. They offered him good bread. Said 
  that person, &quot;What is this for?&quot; They said, &quot;It is bread to eat.&quot; 
  He ate and it was singularly pleasant to his taste. He said, &quot;And of what 
  is this made?&quot; They said, &quot;Of wheat grains.&quot; Then they offered 
  him cakes kneaded in oil. He tasted of them. He said, &quot;And these, of what 
  are they made?&quot; They said, &quot;Of wheat grains.&quot; Then they offered 
  him pastry prepared for royalty, kneaded with honey and oil. He tasted them 
  and said, &quot;And these, of what are they made?&quot; They said, &quot;Of 
  wheat grains.&quot; He said, &quot;Surely I am the master of all of these, for 
  I eat the essence of all of these, which is wheat.&quot; And because of this 
  disposition he knew NOT the delicacies of the world, and they were lost to him. 
  It is likewise for him who seizes the general principle of wisdom, and knows 
  NOT all the pleasing delicacies that derive from the general principle.</font></p>

  Chapter One</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We learned: The Book of THAT Which 
  is Concealed is the book of the balancing in weight. Until NOT existed as weight, 
  NOT existed as seeing Face to Face; And the Primordial Kings died as their crowns 
  were NOT found,<br>
  And the Earth was nullified, Until the Head (Rosh) desired by all desires formed 
  and communicated the garments of splendor. That weight arises from the place 
  which is NOT Him. Those who exist as NOT are weighed in YH. In His body exists 
  the weight. NOT unites and NOT begins. In YH have they ascended, and in YH do 
  they ascend; Who NOT are, and are, and will be.</font></p>

  of all splendors. And the Earth, That is, the second one, is NOT in the computation; 
  This was already said. For it emerged from the one that was cursed, As it is 
  written, From the ground which YHVH cursed. (Torah B'reshith 5:29) ...was unformed 
  and empty and darkness AL (lit. Upon) -Face of the Deep, and the Spirit of Elohim 
  hovers AL-Face of the Waters. (Torah B'reshith 1:2) Thirteen depend from the 
  thirteen of the splendor of splendors. Six thousand years depend on the first

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The seventh above them is that ONE

  therein, especially man.</font></p>
<p>(When trying to imagine the Beard of Macroscopis, see the earth itself as a 
  concentration of spiritual energy, an emanation of Divine Thought. As Pure Thought 
  precedes material form, so God's thoughts toward man preceded both the earth 
  and man. As the Creator descended, from the Higher spheres to the Lower, from

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;These are the chakras (or Emanations) of the Tree of Life (Seven descending, 
    Ten in all), and, along with the other systems of tantric thought, they are 
    related to the Seven primary levels of human consciousness. They are channels 
    into and out of this realm, and connect the central points of interaction 
    that exist between the individual soul, the outside world, and the presence 
    of God who inhabits all. The soul's task, once it has entered into the mystery 
    of Life, is to explore the darkness, that is to go down into the empire of 
    its own existence, and to engage the lower thought forms (the enemy) and to 
    overcome them wherever they are found. The soul must spend its entire lifetime 
    bringing the faculties of the body and mind into subjection, and in the process 
    illuminating or opening up the chakras to the light of higher reality. When 
    the lowest chakra is subdued--brought under subjection, illuminated--the whole 
    body is full of light, and the mystical union between the Mind of God, and 
    the mind of the individual soul is completed. (Or rather can be completed 
    with the proper alignment of concepts and the right revelations.) The soul's 
    descent into the lowest parts of its own existence is directly analogous in 
    the interior world to the Holy Nation's descent on the historical plane to 
    the lowest, most Western parts of the earth, as it is written: ...that they 
    might be called Trees of Righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He 
    and She might be glorified... (Isaiah 61:3). It is to fulfill the words, 'as 
    above so below', 'On earth as it is in heaven.'&quot;</p>

  Necessarily the Ancient One is required.<br>
  The serpent came upon the female<br>
  And a nest of impurity was formed within her,<br>
  Establishing a dwelling for evil.<br>
  Thus it is written:<br>
  And she conceived, and she gave birth to Qain, (Torah B'reshith 4:1) <br>
  The nest of the dwelling of the evil spirits, storms and demons,<br>
  And blows to Qain withinYH.</p>
<p>He formed in that Adam,<br>
  By twos,<br>
  By the general principle and the particular,<br>
  Which are contained in the particular and the general,<br>
  Legs and arms,<br>
  Right and left.<br>
  It divides at its sides.</p>
<p>Male and female were established -YHV.<br>
  Yod male, Heh female.<br>
  Vav as it is written<br>
  Male and female created He them, and blessed them, (Torah B'reshith 1:28) and 
  called their name Adam.<br>
  The form and person of Adam was seated upon the throne, <br>
  as it is written:<br>
  And upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of Adam<br>
  upon it from above. (Ezekiel 1:26)</p>
<p>ChapterCChapterChapterhapter Four<br>
  Sifra Detzniyutha<br>
  Chapter Four</p>
<p>The Ancient One is hidden and concealed.<br>
  The Small Face is manifested and NOT manifested,<br>
  The manifested is written in the letters.<br>
  The NOT on its level is hidden in the letters,<br>
  And HE, the NOT, is settled inYH,<br>
  The upper ones and the lower ones.</p>
<p>And Elohim said the Earth will bring forth living-being according to its kind, 
  cattle and every creeping thing. (Torah B'reshith 1:24)<br>
  This is that which is written<br>
  Adam and cattle You help, Lord YHVH. (Psalm 36:7)<br>
  ONE (Echad) is found in the principle of the other.<br>
  Cattle in the principle of Adam.<br>
  Adam who brings an offering to the Lord from the cattle. (Torah Vayiqra 1:2) 
  <br>
  Because animals are included in the general principle of Adam.</p>
<p>When Adam of Below descended in the supernal form,<br>
  There were found two spirits,<br>
  From two sides, for Adam includes both right and left,<br>
  Of the right, the Neshamah, <br>
  Of the left, the Nefesh Chayah. <br>
  When Adam sinned, the left side did expand.<br>
  And those that are the form of NOT were expanded,<br>
  When these became attached, the one in the other,<br>
  They give birth like unto that living-being that<br>
  gives birth unto many at one time.</p>
<p>Twenty-two letters that are concealed,<br>
  Twenty-two letters that are manifest. <br>
  A concealed Yod, a manifest Yod.<br>
  The concealed and the manifest are balanced in weight,<br>
  Over the weighing of the Yod came forth male and female V'D.<br>
  In this place Vav male , Dalet is female.<br>
  Therefore this D'V is two, <br>
  D'V male and female.<br>
  D'V two pillars, two.<br>
  Yod is by itself, male.<br>
  Heh female.<br>
  Heh at first was Dalet, but after it was impregnated in Yod,<br>
  It brought forth the Vav.<br>
  (Thus, as in the Heh there is D'V, and in the Yod is H'H, hence YHV.)<br>
  Thus the YV'D is seen in its general appearance of YHV.<br>
  Once the YV'D has emitted that which is male and female,<br>
  She is then settled, <br>
  And He covers the Mother.</p>
<p>And the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of Adam. (Torah B'reshith 6:2)<br>
  This is that which is written<br>
  Two men, spies, secretly saying. ((Joshua 2:1)<br>
  What is &quot;daughters of Adam&quot;?<br>
  As it is written<br>
  Then came two women, harlots, unto the king. (I Kings 3)<br>
  On their account it is written<br>
  For they saw the wisdom of Elohim is in him. <br>
  Then came, (I Kings 3)<br>
  And NOT in the beginning.</p>
<p>In the wreath of the union of the fountains,<br>
  There were two embracers from above in V'V,<br>
  These descended from above, and occupied the earth.<br>
  They lost the good part, which was in H'V,<br>
  The wreath of compassion,<br>
  And were wreathed with a cluster of grapes. </p>
<p>And the Lord YHVH said to Mosheh: Why do you cry to Me? (Torah Shmoth 14:15)<br>
  Explicitly stating to Me.<br>
  Speak unto the children of Israel, that they move forward. (Torah Shmoth 14:15)<br>
  Explicitly stating that they move forward.<br>
  It depended on Fate. <br>
  For He wished to honor the beard.<br>
  And what is right in His eyes you will do,<br>
  And you will hearken unto His commandments,<br>
  And you will keep all His statutes, (Torah Shmoth 15:26)<br>
  Up to here,<br>
  For I am the Lord YHVH, your Healer. (Torah Shmoth 15:26)<br>

  As it is written: And the Beauty and the Victory.. (I Chronicles 29:11). <br>
  Into One united.</p>
<p>The Earth (Torah B'reshith 1:1)<br>
  As it is written<br>
  How mighty is your Name in all the Earth, (Psalms 8:2)<br>
  The whole Earth is full of your Glory. (Isaiah 6:3)</p>
<p>IT was a firmament in the midst of the waters. (Torah B'reshith 1:6) <br>
  In order to distinguish between the Holy and the Holy of Holies.<br>
  The Ancient One unto the Small One expands and adheres,<br>
  If NOT adheres<br>
  The mouth speaks great things. (Daniel 7:8)<br>
  IT engages itself<br>
  And wreathes itself with the small crowns,<br>
  With the five kinds of water, <br>
  And thus it is written<br>
  And He shall put from above Living Water. (Torah Doverim 19:17)<br>
  He is the Living Elohim (Elohim Chayim) and the King forever. (Jeremiah 10:10)<br>
  I shall go before the Face of the Lord in the lands of life. (Psalms 116:9)<br>
  And shall be the body of Adonai bound up... (I Samuel 25:29)<br>
  And the Tree of Life in the midst of the Garden. (Torah B'reshith 2:9) <br>
  Y'H YV'D H'A AHY'Y<br>
  Between the waters and the waters. (Torah B'reshith 1:6)<br>
  Waters perfect and waters of NOT, perfect;<br>
  Compassion perfect and compassion of NOT, perfect. </p>
<p>And said the Lord : My Spirit will contend NOT with Adam of Forever,<br>
  seeing that He (Hu) is flesh. (Torah B'reshith 6:3)<br>
  And said the Lord <br>
  When vested in the Small One,<br>
  From here He spoke in the Name of the Speaker,<br>
  For the Ancient Concealed One had said<br>
  My Spirit will contend NOT with Adam of Above.<br>
  For by that Spirit that blows from the two holes of the hollow pillars,<br>
  He causes a flow unto the lower ones,<br>
  And that is why it is written<br>
  And his days shall be a hundred and twenty years. (Torah B'reshith 6:3)</p>
<p>Y'VD is perfect and NOT is perfect.<br>
  Yod y on its own is one hundred.<br>
  And if two letters are put, twice reckoned<br>
  And his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.<br>
  Yod, on its own, when manifest in the Small One, extends into 10,000 years.<br>
  Thus it is written<br>
  And You have placed upon me Your Hand. (Psalms 139:5)</p>
<p>The giants were in the earth. (Torah B'reshith 6:4)<br>
  This is that which is written:<br>
  And from there IT was parted and became four heads. (Torah B'reshith 2:10) <br>
  From the place whence the garden was parted, it is called<br>
  The giants,<br>
  As it is written: And from there IT was parted. <br>
  They were in the earth in those days. (Torah B'reshith 6:4)<br>
  But NOT afterwards.<br>
  When Yehoshua came.<br>
  And the Sons of Elohim were hidden, (Joshua 2:4)<br>
  When Solomon came,<br>
  And the daughters of Adam were contained. (Ecclesiastes 2:8)<br>
  Thus it is written: And the delights of<br>
  Reading Tonlot (not reading Tonlym).<br>
  The sons of Adam<br>
  That were cast out,<br>
  From these were other spirits of NOT,<br>
  Contained in the supernal wisdom,<br>
  Thus it is written: And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon. (I Kings 5:26)<br>
  And it is written: And He was wise unto all of Adam... (I Kings 5:26)<br>
  From IT-was-named, that he was benefited,<br>
  NOT is contained in Adam.<br>
  And the Lord YHVH gave wisdom <br>
  The Heh above.<br>
  And he was wise<br>
  From that he became wise below.</p>
<p>They are the mighty ones that are of Eternity... (Torah B'reshith 6:4)<br>
  The Eternity of Above.</p>
<p>The men of the Name...(Torah B'reshith 6:4)<br>
  They who conduct themselves in the Name.<br>
  What is the Name?<br>
  The Holy Name,<br>
  They who conduct themselves inYH,<br>
  THAT NOT is the Holy Ones below,<br>
  And NOT-conduct themselves only in the Name.</p>
<p>The men of the Name... of perfection,<br>
  And NOT is the men of the Lord ,<br>
  Their NOT is concealed and is being concealed.<br>
  But IT is a diminutive while NOT being a diminutive.</p>
<p>The men of the Name... of perfection,<br>
  Come out from the principle of Adam.<br>
  As it is written:<br>
  Adam being in splendor, in NOT abides. (Psalms 49:13)<br>
  Adam being in splendor, in the splendor of the King.<br>
  In NOT abides, in the NOT-Spirit.</p>
<p>There are thirteen kings of war in seven. <br>
  Seven kings in earth appear as victors in war. <br>
  There are nine that ascend on the levels, <br>
  Who run according to their wish,<br>
  And there is none to prevent them.<br>
  Five kings exist in terror. <br>
  In the presence of four - NOT, they can stand. <br>
  Four kings come out before four, <br>
  They hang on them like grapes in a cluster,<br>
  Bound up in them are seven runners that give testimony,<br>
  And NOT do they remain in their places.</p>
<p>The Tree that mitigates is placed within. <br>
  Birds attach themselves and nest on its branches. <br>
  Below it shelters that Chayah (Living Being) that rules over this Tree,<br>
  Which has two paths to walk,<br>
  It is surrounded by seven pillars, <br>
  With the four Chayot (Living Beings) that are moved in the four directions,<br>
  The serpent turns swiftly with three hundred and seventy leaps,<br>
  Leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills, (Song of Songs 2:8)<br>
  As it is written:<br>
  Leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills. <br>
  Its tail is in its mouth, in its teeth.<br>
  He is pierced through on two sides,<br>
  When it moves, the body is transformed into three directions. </p>
<p>It is written:<br>
  And Chanokh walked with Elohim. (Torah B'reshith 5:24)<br>
  And it is written:<br>
  Give instruction to the Youth (Nar), the Face AL, His way.(Proverbs 22:6) <br>
  To the Youth, that is well known.<br>
  With Elohim and NOT with the Lord .<br>
  And He was NOT.<br>
  In the name This (Zeh). <br>
  For Elohim had taken him. (Torah B'reshith 5:24)<br>
  To be called by His Name.</p>
<p>There are three houses of judgments which are four,<br>
  Four houses of judgments that are above, four below,<br>
  Thus it is written:<br>
  You shall do NOT-evil in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, and in measure. (Torah 
  Vayiqra 19:35)<br>
  There is a judgment that is severe, and a judgment that is NOT-severe.<br>
  A judgment that is balanced, and a judgment that is NOT-balanced.<br>
  A judgment that is soft.<br>
  (A judgment) toward Over-the-Face, <br>
  NOT-THIS and NOT-THAT. </p>
<p>And IT was that the Adam of the great began in the AL-Face<br>
  of the ground. (Torah B'reshith 6:1)<br>
  The Adam of the great...<br>
  This is that which is written:<br>
  For also...<br>
  Adam of Above.<br>
  And it is written:<br>
  AL-Face of the ground. </p>
<p>And Mosheh knew THAT-NOT, the skin of his face shone. (Torah Shmoth 34:29) 
  <br>
  This is that which is written:<br>
  Garments of skin... (Torah B'reshith 3:21)<br>
  Horn... <br>
  As it is written:<br>
  And Samuel took the horn of oil. (I Samuel 16:13)<br>
  For there is no anointing except with the horn.<br>
  And in Your Name our horn is exalted. (Psalms 89:18)<br>
  The Name have I revealed upon the skin of David. (Psalms 132:17)<br>
  That is the tenth of the King.<br>
  And IT comes from that Jubilee which is the Mother,<br>
  As it is written:<br>
  For IT shall be when the horn of the Jubilee is sounded. (Joshua 6:5)<br>
  The horn is wreathed with the Jubilee, the tenth in the Mother. <br>
  The horn, IT takes the horn and the Spirit to restore the Spirit inYH.<br>
  And this horn is of the Jubilee, Heh.<br>
  And the Jubilee is Heh.<br>
  And the Heh is the blower of the Spirit unto all.<br>
  And all return to their place,<br>
  Thus it is written:<br>
  AHH YHVH Elohim. (Jeremiah 1:6)<br>
  When Heh appears unto Heh , <br>
  YHVH Elohim,<br>
  The perfect Name from NOT<br>
  And it is written<br>
  The Lord YHVH alone shall be exalted in the Day of THAT. (Isaiah 2:11)</p>
<p>Up to here is the hidden and adorned Concealment of the King,<br>
  This is the Book of THAT Which is Concealed,<br>
  Happy is he that (enters and) comes out, and knows ITs paths and ways.</p>
<p>Sifra Detzniyutha<br>
  APPENDIX I </p>
<p>In Chapter Three, after the verse: <br>
  And Elohim said the waters will swarm with movement of living being. (Torah 
  B'reshith 1:20)<br>
  There is an extensive addition from the sixteenth century CE, 5300's Jewish 
  Era:</p>
<p>(Another interpretation)<br>
  the waters will swarm with movement<br>
  translated <br>
  with movement<br>
  Meaning to say when his lips move with words of prayer,<br>
  in merit and clarity of mind,</p>
<p>For when man wishes to order his prayer to his Master,<br>
  And his lips move in such a way from below upwards--<br>
  To raise the honor of his Master to the place of irrigation of the deep well<br>
  that flows and comes out.<br>
  Then it will flow to draw forth from above downwards,<br>
  From that irrigation of the river-bed to every level and level,<br>
  (down) to the last level,<br>
  In order to elicit a freewill offering from above downwards.<br>
  Afterwards he needs to bind a knot in all,<br>
  The bond of the intention of the faith,<br>
  And all his requests shall come about--<br>
  Whether they be communal requests or individual requests.</p>
<p>The prayer that man should request of his Master is arranged in nine ways:<br>
  1) there is according to the alphabet; and,<br>
  2) there is by way of mentioning the attributes of the Holy One, <br>
  blessed be He e.g. compassionate, gracious, etc;<br>
  3) there is according to the precious Names of the Holy One, blessed be He, 
  like:<br>
  Ehyeh (I will be), YH, YHV, , El, Elohim, Tzuhvaoth (Host), Shadhai (Almighty), 
  Adonai (My Master);<br>
  4) there is according to the ten Sefiroth, like:<br>
  Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, Netzah, Tifareth, Gevurah, Gedulah, Binah, Hochmah, Keter;<br>
  5) there is by mentioning the righteous ones, like the Patriarchs, and the Prophets, 
  <br>
  and the Kings;<br>
  6) there is the form of songs and praises (for which there is a true tradition), 
  and higher than these;<br>
  7) there is he who knows to prepare adornments unto his Master, in a becoming 
  fashion;<br>
  8) there is (the prayer) with the knowledge how to ascend from below upwards;<br>
  9) there is the he who knows to elicit the abundance from above downwards.</p>
<p>And for all these nine ways is required great intention.<br>
  For without that, about such there is a verse, as it is written:<br>
  And they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed. (I Samuel 2:30)<br>
  And in the intention of Amen (is) that it compounds two Names: YHVH and ADONAI.<br>
  The one conceals its goodness and its blessing in a treasure that is called 
  &quot;Hall.&quot;<br>
  This is indicated in the verse:<br>
  And the Lord YHVH is in His holy Hall, keep silence before Him. (Habakuk 2:20) 
  <br>
  Our sages, of blessed memory, alluded to this (when stating that) <br>
  all the good of a man is in his house, as it is said:<br>
  In all my house he is faithful. (Torah Doverim 12:7)<br>
  And it is translated: In all that is with Me. (Psalms 24:7)<br>
  And when (man) has intention in every one of the nine ways as behooves,<br>
  He is the human being that honors the Master, the Holy Name.<br>
  And of him it is written:<br>
  For they that honor Me I will honor, and they that despise me<br>
  shall be lightly esteemed. (I Samuel 2:30) <br>
  I will honor. (I Samuel 2:30) <br>
  In this world, to fulfill and to bring about all his needs,<br>
  And all the nations of the earth will see that the name of Elohim<br>
  is called upon him, and will fear him.<br>
  And in the world to come he will merit to stand in the division of the pious,<br>
  even though he did not study sufficiently.<br>
  For he merited to mind the knowledge of his Master<br>
  and had the proper intention thereto.</p>
<p>What is:<br>
  And they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed? (I Samuel 2:30)<br>
  It refers to him that does not know to unify the Holy Name<br>
  And to bind the knot of the faith<br>
  And to draw forth to that place that is in need,<br>
  And to honor the Name of his Master.<br>
  The more so with regard to he who has no intention,<br>
  Amen.</p>
<p>Thus, whoever moves his lips with purity of heart,<br>
  In the waters that purify,<br>
  What is written of him?<br>
  And Elohim said: Let Us make Adam. (Torah B'reshith 1:7)<br>
  Meaning to say (Let Us make) because of man,<br>
  (He) who knows to unify the image and the likeness as behooves,<br>
  And they will have dominion over the fish of the sea. (Torah B'reshith 1:26) 
</p>
<p>APPENDIX II</p>
<p>There is another addition at the very end of the Sifra Detzniyutha:<br>
  When the one Heh is turned towards the other Heh , and Yod is taken away, then 
  comes vengeance into the universe; and except for that Adam who is called [by 
  the Name], the universe would NOT exist; but all things would be destroyed. 
  Hence it is written:<br>
  And the Lord alone shall be exalted in the Day of THAT. (Isaiah 2:11)</p>

<p>GREATER HOLY ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>from the<br>
  Book of Splendor (Sefer HaZohar)<br>
  Mantuan Codex: In the Wilderness (Torah B'midbar) III: 127a-144b</p>
<p><br>
  The following translation is the Work of the Chariot edition of the Lesser Holy 
  Assembly published in 1970.Verses from the Torah are written in Bold Italic. 
  Verses from the Prophets and Writings and are written in Bold.</p>
<p>Chapter One</p>
<p>1. Tradition: Rabbi Shimeon spoke unto his companions, and said: &quot;How 
  long shall we abide in the condition of one column by itself, when it is written 
  (Psalms 119.126): It is time for You Lord YHVH to lay to your hand, for they 
  have made void your Torah.&quot;</p>
<p>2. &quot;The days are few, and the creditor is urgent; the herald cries aloud 
  daily, and the reapers of the land are few; and those who are about the end 
  of the vineyard attend not, and have not known where may be the lawful place.&quot;</p>
<p>3. &quot;Assemble yourselves, O my companions, in an open space, equipped with 
  armor and spears; be ye ready in your preparations, in council, in wisdom, in 
  understanding, in science, in care, with hands and feet! Appoint as King over 
  you, Him in whose power is life and death, so that the words of truth may be 
  received: things unto which the supernal holy ones attend, and rejoice to hear 
  and to know them.&quot;</p>
<p>4. Rabbi Shimeon sat down and wept; then he said: &quot;Woe! If I shall reveal 
  it! Woe if I shall not reveal it!&quot;</p>
<p>5. His companions who were there were silent.</p>
<p>6. Rabbi Abba arose and said unto him: &quot;With the favor of the Lord, also 
  it is written (Psalms 25.14): The secret of the Lord YHVH is with them that 
  fear Him. And well do these companions fear that Holy and Blessed One. His house, 
  some of them have only entered, and some of them have departed also.&quot;</p>
<p>7. Moreover, it is said the companions who were with Rabbi Shimeon were numbered, 
  and they were found to consist of Rabbi Eleazer, his son; and Rabbi Abba, and 
  Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Yosi, son of Jacob, and Rabbi Yitza'aq, and Rabbi Chisqiah, 
  son of Rav, and Rabbi Chaiya, and Rabbi Yosi, and Rabbi Yisa. (see Figure)</p>
<p>8. They gave their hands unto Rabbi Shimeon, and raised their fingers on high, 
  and entered into a field under the trees and sat down.</p>
<p>9. Rabbi Shimeon arose and offered a prayer. He sat in the midst of them, and 
  said: &quot;Let whosoever will, place his hand in my bosom.&quot; They placed 
  their hands there and he took them.</p>
<p>10. When he began, he said (Torah Doverim 27.15): &quot;Cursed is the man that 
  makes any graven or molten image, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and 
  puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say Amen.&quot;</p>
<p>11. Rabbi Shimeon began and said: &quot;Time for You, O Lord YHVH to lay Your 
  hand. Why is it time for Lord YHVH to lay to His hand? Because they have made 
  void your Torah. What is this, they have made void Your Torah? The higher Torah, 
  which is itself made void, if it be NOT (Vast Face) carried out according to 
  the Perfections (Tikkunim, i.e. Sefiroth). This has been said concerning the 
  Ancient of Days (Arikh Anpin, Vast Face).&quot;</p>
<p>12. &quot;For it is written (Torah Doverim 33.29): Blessed are you, O Israel; 
  who is like unto you? Also it is written (Torah Shmoth 15.11): Who is like unto 
  You among the gods, O Lord YHVH?&quot;</p>
<p>13. He called Rabbi Eleazer, his son, and commanded him to sit down before 
  him, and Rabbi Abba on the other side, and said: &quot;We are the form of all 
  things, the three columns of the Sefiroth; thus far are the Tikkunim established.&quot; 
</p>
<p>14. They kept silence, and they heard a voice; and their knees knocked one 
  against the other with fear. What was that voice? The voice of the Higher Assembly, 
  which had assembled above.</p>
<p>15. Rabbi Shimeon rejoiced and said (Habakuk 3.1): &quot;O Lord YHVH! I have 
  heard Your speech, and was afraid!&quot; He has said: 'It is therefore rightly 
  done, seeing that fear has followed; but for us the matter rather depends on 
  love.' Like as it is written (Torah Shmoth 6.5): &quot;And you shall delight 
  in the Lord YHVH your Elohim.&quot; Also it is written (Malachi 1.2): &quot;I 
  have loved you.&quot;</p>
<p>16. Rabbi Shimeon said further (Proverbs 9.13): &quot;He who walks, going up 
  and down, reveals the secret; but the faithful in spirit conceals the word.&quot;</p>
<p>17. &quot;He who walks going up and down. This saying merits question, because 
  it says,<br>
  'Going up and down.' Wherefore then 'walks'? The man is already said to be going 
  up and down; what is this word 'walk'?&quot;</p>
<p>18. &quot;For truly it is true concerning that man who is not stable in his 
  spirit nor truthful, that the word which he has heard is moved hither and thither, 
  like a straw in the water, until it comes forth from him.&quot;</p>
<p>19. &quot;For what reason? Because his spirit is not a firm spirit.&quot;</p>
<p>20. &quot;But concerning him who is firm in spirit it is written: But the faithful 
  conceals the word. 'Faithful in spirit' denotes firmness of spirit; like it 
  is said (Isaiah 22.23): And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place. Matter 
  depends on Spirit.&quot; </p>
<p>21. &quot;And it is written (Ecclesiastes 5.6): Suffer not your mouth to cause 
  thy flesh to sin.&quot;</p>
<p>22. &quot;For neither does the world remain firm, except through secrets. And 
  in worldly affairs there be so great a need for secrets, how much more in the 
  things of the most secret of secrets, and in the meditation of the Ancient of 
  Days, which matters are not even revealed unto the highest angels.&quot;</p>
<p>23. Rabbi Shimeon said, moreover: &quot;I will not say it unto the heavens, 
  that they may hear; I will not declare it unto the earth, that it may hear; 
  for certainly we are the pillars of the Universe.&quot;</p>
<p>24. It is said that in the Secrets of Secrets, when Rabbi Shimeon opened his 
  mouth, the whole space was shaken, and his companions were also shaken.</p>
<p>Chapter Two </p>
<p>25. HE manifested the Secret, and commencing, said (Torah B'reshith 36.29): 
  &quot;And those are the kings (i.e. the Sefiroth) which reigned in the land 
  of Edom before that a king could rule over the children of Israel.&quot; </p>
<p>26. Blessed are ye, O just men! Because unto you is manifested the Secret (Sod) 
  of the Secret of the Torah, which has not been manifested unto the holy superior 
  ones.</p>
<p>27. Who can follow out this matter? And who is worthy to do so? For it is the 
  testimony of the truth of truths. Therefore let our prayers be undertaken with 
  devotion, lest it be imputed as a sin, that I am making this matter manifest.</p>
<p>28. And perchance my companions may speak unto me, because some objection may 
  arise against these words. For truly this work is not such a one as may be easily 
  written down, so that by it may appear how many kings there were before the 
  children of Israel came; how therefore does this matter agree? And for this 
  reason my companions have moved the question.</p>
<p>29. Therefore, the Secret of Secrets is what man can neither know nor comprehend, 
  nor can they apply their rules of science to it.</p>
<p>30. It is said that before the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the Concealed of 
  the Concealed Ones, instituted the formations of the King (Ze'ir Anafin, Small 
  Face) and the diadems; beginning and end existed as NOT (Lo).</p>
<p>31. Therefore he carved out and instituted proportions in Himself, and spread 
  out before Him a certain veil; and therein carved out and distributed the kings 
  and their forms by a certain proportion; but they subsisted as NOT (Lo), into 
  quiet.</p>
<p>32. That is the same thing that is said (Torah B'reshith 36.29): &quot;And 
  these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom,&quot; before that there 
  reigned a king over the children of Israel. The first king in respect of the 
  children of Israel is 'The First' [Sefirah Knowledge/The First].</p>
<p>33. And all those things which were carved out, but subsisted as NOT, are called 
  by their names, neither yet did they subsist, until he forsook them, and hid 
  Himself before them.</p>
<p>Chapter Three</p>
<p>34. And after a certain time was that veil entirely disunited in formless separation, 
  and recomposed according to the Perfections (Tikkunim, also Sefiroth).</p>
<p>35. And this is the tradition: The Absolute desired within Himself to create 
  the essence of light (n. letters of the alphabet), hidden for two thousand years, 
  and produced Him (Small Face). And He (Small Face) answered unto Him (Vast Face): 
  &quot;He (Vast Face) who wishes to dispose and to constitute other things, let 
  Him (Small Face) first be disposed according to the Perfections.&quot;</p>
<p>36. This is the tradition described in the &quot;Concealed Book of the King,&quot; 
  that the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the Concealed of the Concealed Ones, has 
  been constituted and prepared as in various members.</p>
<p>37. Like as if it were said, &quot;He is found, and He is NOT (Lo) found;&quot; 
  for He cannot be clearly comprehended, but He has as it were been formed; neither 
  yet is He to be known by any, since He is the Ancient of the Ancient Ones (Vast 
  Face).</p>
<p>38. But in His Perfections is He first established, as also He is the Eternal 
  of the Eternal Ones, the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the Concealed of the Concealed 
  Ones; and in His letters is He knowable and NOT knowable.</p>
<p>39. White are His garments, and His appearance is the likeness of a Face vast 
  and terrible.</p>
<p>40. Upon the throne of flaming light is He seated, so that He may direct its 
  flashes.</p>
<p>41. Into forty thousand superior worlds the brightness of the skull of His 
  Head is extended, and from the light of this brightnessthe just shall receive 
  four hundred worlds in the world to come.</p>
<p>42. This is that which is written (Torah B'reshith 23.16): &quot;Four hundred 
  shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.&quot;</p>
<p>43. Within His skull exist daily thirteen thousand myriads of worlds, which 
  draw their existence from Him, and by Him are upheld.</p>
<p>Chapter Four</p>
<p>44. And from that skull distills a dew upon Him which is external, and fills 
  His Head daily.</p>
<p>45. And from that dew which flows down from His Head, that which is external, 
  the dead are raised up in the world to come.</p>
<p>46. Concerning which it is written (Song of Songs 5.2): &quot;My head is filled 
  with dew.&quot; It is not written: &quot;It is full with dew,&quot; but Nimla 
  (almn), &quot;It is filled.&quot;</p>
<p>47. And it is written (Isaiah 26.19): &quot;The dew of the lights is Your dew.&quot; 
  Of the lights-- that is, from the brightness of the Ancient One.</p>
<p>48. And by that dew are nourished the holy supernal ones. </p>
<p>49. And this is that manna which is prepared for the just in the world to come.</p>
<p>50. And that dew distills upon the ground of the holy apple trees. This is 
  that which is written (Torah Shmoth 16.14): &quot;And when the dew was gone 
  up, behold upon the face of the desert a small round thing.&quot;</p>
<p>51. And the appearance of this dew is white, like unto the color of the crystal 
  stone, whose appearance has all colors in it. This is that which is written 
  (Torah Vayiqra 2.7): &quot;And its varieties as the varieties of crystal.&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter Five</p>
<p>52. The whiteness of this skull shines in thirteen carved out sides: in four 
  sides from one portion; in four sides from the part of His Face; and in four 
  sides from another part of the periphery; and in one above the skull, as if 
  this last might be called the supernal side.</p>
<p>53. And thence is the Vastness of His Face extended into three hundred and 
  seventy myriads of worlds; and hence &quot;Vast Face&quot; is His Name.</p>
<p>54. And He Himself, the most Ancient of the Ancient Ones, is called &quot;Vast 
  Face&quot;; and He who is more external is called &quot;Small Face&quot;, in 
  opposition to the Ancient Eternal Holy One, the Holy of Holy Ones.</p>
<p>55. And when Small Face looks back upon Him (Vast Face), all the inferiors 
  are restored in order, and His Face is extended, and is made more vast at that 
  time, but not for all time is it vast like unto the countenance of the More 
  Ancient One.</p>
<p>56. And from that skull issues a certain white shining emanation, toward the 
  skull of Small Face, for the purpose of fashioning His head; and thence towards 
  the other inferior skulls, which are innumerable.</p>
<p>57. And all the skulls reflect this shining whiteness towards the Ancient of 
  Days, when they are numbered out of their undifferentiated condition. And by 
  reason of this there exists herein an opening towards the skull below, when 
  they proceed to numeration. </p>
<p>Chapter Six</p>
<p>58. In the hollow of the skull is the aerial membrane of the supreme hidden 
  wisdom, which is nowhere revealed; and it is NOT (Lo) found and it is NOT opened.</p>
<p>59. And that membrane enshrouds the brain of the hidden wisdom, and therefore 
  is that wisdom covered, because it is NOT (Lo) opened through that membrane.</p>
<p>60. And that brain, which is itself the hidden wisdom, is silent and remains 
  tranquil in its place, like good wine upon its lees.</p>
<p>61. And this is that which they say: &quot;Hidden is the science of the Ancient 
  One, and His brain is calm and concealed.&quot;</p>
<p>62. And that membrane has an outlet toward Small Face, and on that account 
  is His brain extended, and goes forth by thirty-two paths. </p>
<p>63. This is the same thing that is written (Torah B'reshith 2.7): &quot;And 
  a river went forth out of Eden.&quot; But for what reason? Because the membrane 
  is opened, and does it completely enshroud the brain.</p>
<p>64. Nevertheless, the membrane is opened from below. And this is that which 
  we have said: Among the signatures of the letters is Tav-Yod-Vav; nevertheless 
  He impressed it as a sign of the Ancient of Days, from Whom depends the perfection 
  of knowledge, because He is perfect on every side, and hidden, and tranquil, 
  and silent, like good wine upon its lees.</p>
<p>Chapter Seven</p>
<p>65. This is the tradition: From the skull of His Head hang down a thousand 
  thousand myriads; seven thousand and five hundred curling hairs, white and pure, 
  like as wool when it is pure; which have not been mingled confusedly together, 
  less inordinate disorder should be shown in His confirmation; but all are in 
  order, so that no one lock may go beyond another lock, nor one hair before another.</p>
<p>66. And in single curls are four hundred and ten locks of hair, according to 
  the number of the word Qadosh (Holy). </p>
<p>67. But these hairs, all and singular, radiate into four hundred and ten worlds.</p>
<p>68. But these worlds alone are hidden and concealed, and no man knows them, 
  save Himself.</p>
<p>69. And He radiates in seven hundred and twenty directions.</p>
<p>70. And in all the hairs is a fountain, which issues from the hidden brain 
  behind the wall of the skull.</p>
<p>71. And it shines and goes forth through that hair unto the hair of Small Face 
  and from it is His brain formed, and thence that brain goes forth into thirty 
  and two paths.</p>
<p>72. And each curl radiates and hangs down arranged in beautiful form, and adorned 
  with ornament, and they enshroud the skull.</p>
<p>73. But the curls of the hair are disposed on each side of the skull.</p>
<p>74. Also we have said: Each hair is said to be the breaking of the hidden fountains, 
  issuing from the concealed brain.</p>
<p>75. Also this is the tradition: From the hair of a man it is known what he 
  is, whether rigorous or merciful, when he passes over forty years; thus also 
  when he is perfect in hair, in beard, and in eyebrows of his eyes.</p>
<p>76. The curls of His hair hang down in order, and pure like unto wool, even 
  unto His shoulders. Say we unto His shoulders? Nevertheless, even unto the rise 
  of His shoulders, so that His neck may not be seen, because of that which is 
  written (Jeremiah 2.27): &quot;Because they have turned away from Me the neck 
  and NOT the face.&quot;</p>
<p>77. And the hair is less close to the ears, lest it should cover them; because 
  it is written (Psalms 130.2), &quot;As Your ears are open.&quot;</p>
<p>78. From hence His hair stretches out behind His ears. The whole is in equilibrium; 
  one hair does not go beyond another hair, they are in perfect disposition, and 
  beautiful arrangement, and orderly condition.</p>
<p>79. It is the delight and joy of the just, who are in Small Face, to desire 
  and to behold and to conform unto those Perfections (Sefiroth) which are in 
  the Ancient One, the Most Concealed of all.</p>
<p>80. Thirteen curls of hair exist on the one side and on the other of the skull; 
  they are about His face, and through them commences the division of the hair.</p>
<p>81. There is no left in that Ancient Concealed One, but all is right.</p>
<p>82. He appears, and He appears NOT (Lo); He is concealed, and He is NOT (Lo) 
  concealed; and that is in His Perfections much more so than in Himself.</p>
<p>83. And concerning this the children of Israel wished to inquire in their heart, 
  like as it is written (Torah Shmoth 17.7): &quot;Is the Lord YHVH in the midst 
  of us, or the Negatively Existent One?&quot; Where they distinguished between 
  Small Face, who is called &quot;YHVH&quot;, and between Vast Face, who is called 
  &quot;Nothing&quot; (Ayn), the Negatively Existent.</p>
<p>84. But why, then, were they punished? Because they did it not in love, but 
  in temptation; like as it is written: &quot;Because they tempted their Lord 
  YHVH saying: Is it the Lord YHVH in the midst of us, or is it the Negatively 
  Existent One?&quot;</p>
<p>85. In the parting of the hair proceeds a certain path, which shines into two 
  hundred and seventy worlds. And from that path again shines another path wherein 
  the just of the world to come shall shine.</p>
<p>86. That is what is written (Proverbs 4.18): &quot;And the path of the just 
  shall shine as the light, going forth, and shining more and more unto the perfect 
  day.&quot;</p>
<p>87. And out of that is the path divided into six hundred and thirteen paths, 
  which are distributed in Small Face.</p>
<p>88. As it is written concerning Him (Psalms 25.6): &quot;All the paths of the 
  Lord YHVH are mercy and truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter Eight</p>
<p>89. The forehead of His skull is the will of wills, whereunto is opposed the 
  will of Small Face, as it is written (Torah Shmoth 28.38): &quot;And it shall 
  be upon His forehead always for will ...&quot;</p>
<p>90. And that forehead is called &quot;Will&quot; (Ratzon), because it is the 
  ruler of the whole head and of the skull, which is covered by four hundred and 
  twenty worlds.</p>
<p>91. And when it is uncovered, the prayers of the Israelites ascend.</p>
<p>92. &quot;When is it uncovered/&quot; Rabbi Shimeon was silent. He asked again 
  a second time, &quot;When?&quot; Rabbi Shimeon said unto Rabbi Eleazar, his 
  son, &quot;When is it uncovered?</p>
<p>93. He answered unto him: &quot;In the time of the offering of the evening 
  prayer on the Sabbath.&quot;</p>
<p>94. He said unto him: &quot;For what reason?&quot; He answered unto him: &quot;Because 
  at that time the lower judgment threatens through Small Face; but that forehead 
  is uncovered which is called 'Will,' and then wrath is removed, and the prayer 
  ascends.&quot; </p>
<p>95. &quot;This is that which is written (Psalms 89.14): And I have prayed unto 
  You, O Lord YHVH in the time of the Will of Elohim.&quot;</p>
<p>96. &quot;And the time of will by the Ancient of Days (Vast Face) is here to 
  be understood, and of the unveiling of the forehead; and because it is thus 
  disposed at the offering of the evening prayer on the Sabbath.&quot;</p>
<p>97. Rabbi Shimeon spake unto Rabbi Eleazar, his son, and said: &quot;Blessed 
  be you, O my son! By the Ancient of Days; for you have found in that time in 
  which you have need of the will of His forehead.&quot;</p>
<p>98. Come and behold! In these inferiors, when the forehead is uncovered, there 
  is found fixed shamelessness.</p>
<p>99. This is the same which is written (Jeremiah 3.3): &quot;Yet you have the 
  forehead of a shameless woman, you refuse to be ashamed.&quot;</p>
<p>100. But when this forehead (Vast Face) is uncovered, inclination and will 
  are found in perfect form, and all wrath is quieted and subdues before Him.</p>
<p>101. From that forehead shine forth four hundred habitations of judgments, 
  when it is uncovered during that period of will, and all things are at peace 
  before it.</p>
<p>102. This is the same which is written (Daniel 7.10): &quot;The judgment was 
  set...&quot; -- that is, subsides in its place, and the judgment is not exercised.</p>
<p>103. And this is the tradition: There is no hair found on that part, because 
  it is opened and not covered.</p>
<p>104. It is covered, I say, and the executors of judgment behold this, and are 
  pacified and (judgment) is not exercised.</p>
<p>105. This is the tradition: This forehead has been extended into two hundred 
  and seventy thousand lights of the luminaries of the superior Eden.</p>
<p>106. This is the tradition: There exists an Eden which shines in Eden. The 
  superior Eden, which is NOT (Lo) uncovered, and is hidden in concealment, and 
  is NOT (Lo) distributed into the paths, like as it has been said.</p>
<p>107. The inferior Eden is distributed into its paths, into thirty-two directions 
  of Its paths.</p>
<p>108. And although this Eden is distributed into Its paths, yet is it NOT (Lo) 
  known unto any, save unto Small Face.</p>
<p>109. But no man has known the superior Eden, nor its paths, except Vast Face 
  Himself.</p>
<p>110. Like as it is written (Job 28.23): &quot;Elohim understands the way thereof, 
  and He knows the place thereof.&quot;</p>
<p>111. &quot;Elohim understands the way thereof,&quot; this is the inferior Eden, 
  known unto Small Face. &quot;And He knows the place thereof,&quot; this is the 
  superior Eden, which the Ancient of Days has known, the most abstruse of all.</p>
<p>Chapter Nine</p>
<p>112. The eyes of the White Head (Vast Face) are diverse from all other eyes. 
  Above the eye is no eyelid, neither is there an eyebrow over it.</p>
<p>113. Wherefore? Because it is written (Psalms 111.4): &quot;Behold, He that 
  keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep&quot;--that is, the superior Eden 
  .</p>
<p>114. Also it is written (Jeremiah 32.19): &quot;Whose eyes are open.&quot;</p>
<p>115. And this is the tradition: Seeing that all is operated through mercies, 
  He has not covering unto His eye, nor eyebrow above His eye. How little, then, 
  does the White Head require such?</p>
<p>116. Rabbi Shimeon spoke unto Rabbi Abba, and said: &quot;To what is this like?&quot; 
  He answered unto him: &quot;To the whales and fishes of the sea, which have 
  no coverings for their eyes, nor eyebrows above their eyes; who sleep not, and 
  require not a protection for the eye.&quot;</p>
<p>117. &quot;How much less does the Ancient of the Ancient of the Ancient Ones 
  require a protection, seeing that far above His creatures He watches over all 
  things, and all things are nourished by Him, and He Himself sleeps not.&quot;</p>
<p>118. &quot;This is that which is written (Psalms 121.4): Behold! He that keeps 
  Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep-- that is, the superior Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>119. &quot;It is written (Psalms 33.18): Behold the eye of the Lord YHVH is 
  upon them that realize Him; and it is written (Zechariah 4.10): They are the 
  eyes of the Lord YHVH, running to and fro throughout the whole earth.&quot;</p>
<p>120. &quot;There is no contradiction (between these sayings); one is concerning 
  Small Face and the other concerning Vast Face.&quot; </p>
<p>121. &quot;And further, although there be two eyes, yet they are converted 
  into one eye.&quot;</p>
<p>122. &quot;This is pure in its whiteness, and so white that it includes all 
  whiteness.&quot;</p>
<p>123. &quot;The first whiteness shines, and ascends and descends for the purpose 
  of combining with that which is linked (with it) in connection.&quot;</p>
<p>124. &quot;This is the tradition: That whiteness darts forth its rays, and 
  ignites three lights, which are called &quot;Glory&quot; (Hod), &quot;Majesty&quot; 
  (Hadar), and &quot;Joy&quot; (Chedved); and they radiate in gladness and perfection.&quot;</p>
<p>125. &quot;The second whiteness shines and ascends and descends, and darts 
  forth its rays, and ignites three other lights, which are called &quot;Eternity&quot; 
  (Netzach), &quot;Lovingkindness&quot; (Chesed), and &quot;Beauty&quot; (Tifareth), 
  and they radiate in perfection and gladness.&quot;</p>
<p>126. &quot;The third whiteness radiates and shines, and descends and ascends, 
  and goes forth from the part enclosing the brain, and darts forth its rays toward 
  the seventh middle light.&quot;</p>
<p>127. &quot;And it forms a path to the inferior brain, which forms a path to 
  the inferiors, and all the inferior lights are thereby ignited.&quot;</p>
<p>128. Rabbi Shimeon said; &quot;You have spoken well, and the Ancient of Days 
  will open this eye upon you in the time of your need.</p>
<p>129. Another tradition runs thus: Whiteness in whiteness, and whiteness that 
  includes all other whiteness.</p>
<p>130. The first whiteness shines and ascends and descends in three lights on 
  the left-hand side, and they radiate and are bathed in that whiteness, like 
  as when a man bathes in good unguents and odors, in better condition than he 
  at first possessed.</p>
<p>131. The second whiteness descends and ascends and shines in three lights on 
  the right-hand side, and they radiate and are bathed in that whiteness, like 
  as when a man bathes his body in good unguents and odors, in better condition 
  than he at first possessed.</p>
<p>132. The third whiteness shines and ascends and descends, and goes forth as 
  the light of the inner whiteness of the brain, and sends forth its rays when 
  necessary unto the black hair, and unto the head, and unto the brain of the 
  head (Small Face). </p>
<p>133. And it irradiates the three crowns that remain, when it is needful, so 
  that it may be uncovered if that be pleasing unto the Most Ancient One hidden 
  from all (Vast Face).</p>
<p>134. And this is the tradition: This eye is never closed; and there are two, 
  and they are converted into one. </p>
<p>135. All is right; there is no left there. He sleeps not and slumbers not, 
  and He requires no protection. He is not such a One as has need to defend Himself, 
  for He defends all things, and He Himself waited upon all things, and in the 
  sight of His eye are all things established.</p>
<p>136. This is the tradition: Were that eye closed for even one moment, no thing 
  could subsist.</p>
<p>137. Therefore, it is called the open eye, the holy eye, the excellent eye, 
  the eye of Providence, the eye which sleeps not neither slumbers, the eye which 
  is the guardian of all things, the eye which is the subsistence of all things.</p>
<p>138. And concerning it is it written (Proverbs 22.9), &quot;The bountiful eye;&quot; 
  you shall not read &quot;the blessed eye,&quot; but &quot;it blesses&quot; for 
  it is called &quot;the bountiful eye,&quot; and by it are all things blessed.</p>
<p>139. And this is the tradition: There is no light in the inferior eye, so that 
  it can be bathed in redness and blackness; except when it is beheld by that 
  white brilliance of the superior eye which is called &quot;the bountiful eye.&quot;</p>
<p>140. And to no man is it known when this superior holy eye may shine and may 
  bathe the inferior; and when the just and the supernal blessed ones are about 
  to be beheld in that wisdom.</p>
<p>141. This is that which is written (Isaiah 3.8): &quot;For they shall see eye 
  to eye.&quot; When? When the Lord YHVH shall bring again Zion. Also, it is written 
  (Torah B'midbar14.14): &quot;That You Lord YHVH are seen eye to eye.&quot; </p>
<p>142. And unless the bountiful superior eye was to look down upon and bathe 
  the inferior eye, the universe could not exist even a single moment.</p>
<p>143, This is the tradition in the &quot;Book of Concealed Mystery:&quot; Providence 
  arises from the inferior eye when the highest splendor shines down upon it, 
  and that highest splendor goes forth into the inferior; for from it are all 
  things illuminated.</p>
<p>144. This is that which is written (Torah B'midbar 14.14): &quot;That You Lord 
  YHVH are seen eye to eye.&quot; Also it is written (Psalms 33.18): &quot;Behold 
  the eye of the Lord YHVH is upon them that fear Him.&quot; And it is written 
  (Zechariah 4.10): &quot;The eyes of the Lord YHVH running to and fro throughout 
  the whole earth.&quot;</p>
<p>145. &quot;The eye of the Lord YHVH is upon them that fear Him,&quot; if they 
  be upright. This is the superior eye. On the contrary, when it is said, &quot;The 
  eyes of the Lord YHVH run to and fro,&quot; this is the eye that is below.</p>
<p>146. This is the tradition: On what account was Joseph worthy, so that the 
  evil eye had no dominion over him? Because that he was worthy of being upheld 
  by the superior benign eye.</p>
<p>147. This is that which is written (Torah B'reshith 49.22): &quot;Joseph is 
  the son of a fruitful bough;&quot; the son of a fruitful bough above Ayin. Why 
  &quot;the son of a fruitful bough above Ayin? As though to imply, &quot;because 
  of that eye which beheld him.&quot;</p>
<p>148. Also it is written (Proverbs 22.9): &quot;The bountiful eye shall be blessed.&quot; 
  Why? Because it gives its bread unto the poor. </p>
<p>149. Why is it said in the singular number? Come and see. In the eyes which 
  are inferior are a right eye and a left eye, and they are of two diverse colors.</p>
<p>150. But in this instance there is no left eye, and they both ascend in one 
  path, and all are right. And on that account is one eye mentioned, and not two.</p>
<p>151. And this is the tradition: This eye, which is the eye of witnessing, is 
  ever open, ever smiling, and ever glad.</p>
<p>152. Such are not the inferiors, who in themselves have redness, and blackness, 
  and whiteness--three colors; and are not always open, for there are eyelids 
  as a protection over these eyes. </p>
<p>153. And concerning the matter it is written (Psalms 44.23): &quot;Awake, O 
  Lord YHVH, why do You sleep?&quot; And (II Kings 19.16): &quot;Open Your eyes, 
  O Lord YHVH.&quot;</p>
<p>154. When they are opened, for some are they opened for good, and on some they 
  are opened for evil.</p>
<p>155. Woe unto him upon whom it is opened, so that the eye is mingled with redness, 
  and unto whom the redness appears, spreading across that eye. Who can escape 
  from it?</p>
<p>156. But the Ancient of Days is blessed, presiding over that eye the white 
  brilliance of whiteness, seeing that also it is of such whiteness that it endures 
  all whiteness.</p>
<p>157. Blessed also is his portion whom that brilliance of all whiteness irradiates.</p>
<p>158. And concerning this certainly it is written (Proverbs 22.9): &quot;The 
  good eye is to be blessed.&quot; And it is written (Isaiah 2.5): &quot;Be you 
  present, O house of Jacob, and let us walk in the light of the Lord YHVH!&quot;</p>
<p>159. This is the tradition: Save in all these instances, the Name of the Ancient 
  One is concealed from all, and is NOT (Lo) mentioned in the Torah, save in one 
  place, where Small Face swore unto Abraham.</p>
<p>160. Like as it is written (Torah B'reshith 22.16): &quot;By Myself have I 
  sworn, said the Lord YHVH.&quot; (Understand) that this is concerning Small 
  Face. </p>
<p>161. Like as it is written (Torah B'reshith 48.20): &quot;In You shall Israel 
  bless. That is, the superior Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>162. Also it is written (Isaiah 49.3): &quot;Israel in whom I will be glorified.&quot; 
  In these passages the Ancient of Days is called &quot;Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>163. But we have also stated that the Ancient of Days is called by His Name, 
  yet both this (statement) and the other are correct.</p>
<p>164. This is the tradition: It is written (Daniel 7.9): &quot;I beheld until 
  the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit.&quot;</p>
<p>165. &quot;The thrones were cast down.&quot; What is this? He spoke unto Rabbi 
  Yehuda, and said: &quot;Stand in your place and explain these thrones.&quot;</p>
<p>166. Rabbi Yehuda answered: &quot;It is written (Daniel 7.9): His throne is 
  of a fiery flame; and upon that throne sat the Ancient of Days.&quot;</p>
<p>167. &quot;For what reason? Because thus is the tradition: If the Ancient of 
  Days were not seated upon that throne, the universe could no longer exist before 
  that throne.&quot;</p>
<p>168. &quot;When the Ancient of Days sits upon that throne, it is subject unto 
  Him. For He who sits upon it rules over it.&quot;</p>
<p>169. &quot;But at that time when He departs from that throne, and sits upon 
  another throne, the first throne is overturned, lest any should rule over it 
  save the Ancient One, who alone can sit upon it.&quot;</p>
<p>170. Rabbi Shimeon spoke unto Rabbi Yehuda, and said: &quot;May your way be 
  ordained for you, and may it be pointed out (unto you) by the Ancient of Days!&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter Ten</p>
<p>171. And come behold. Lo! It is written (Isaiah 41.4): &quot;I, YHVH, am First 
  and Last, I am He (Hu).&quot;<br>
  . <br>
  172. All things are Him, and He is hidden on every side. So also is His nose.</p>
<p>173. From the nose is the face known.</p>
<p>174. And come --see! What is the (difference) between the Ancient One and Small 
  Face? Over these nostrils He rules; one of which is life, and the other is the 
  life of life.</p>
<p>175. This nose is as a mighty gallery, whence His spirit rushes forth upon 
  Small Face, and they call it &quot;The Giver.&quot; </p>
<p>176. And it is thus: The Spirit descends; and again the Spirit from hence proceeds 
  through those nostrils.</p>
<p>177. ONE (Echad) is the Spirit; He goes forth unto Small Face, so that He may 
  be aroused in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>178. And ONE is He, the Spirit of Life, through whom in process of time the 
  sons of David hope to know Wisdom.</p>
<p>179. And from that gallery arises the Spirit, and proceeds from the concealed 
  brain, and at length rests upon King Messiah.</p>
<p>180. Like as it is written (Isaiah 11.2): &quot;And the Spirit of the Lord 
  YHVH shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit 
  of Counsel and Strength, the Spirit of Knowledge, and of the Fear of the Lord 
  YHVH.&quot;</p>
<p>181. Apparently four spirits are here. But we have already said that the Spirit 
  is ONE; why, then, are three? Arise, Rabbi Yosi, in your place.</p>
<p>182. Rabbi Yosi arose and said: &quot;In the days of King Messiah, one shall 
  not say unto the other, 'Teach me wisdom'.&quot;</p>
<p>183. &quot;Because it is thus written (Jeremiah 31.34): A man shall no more 
  teach his neighbor...because all shall know Me, from the least of them even 
  unto the greatest of them.&quot;</p>
<p>184. &quot;And in that time shall the Ancient of Days arouse His Spirit which 
  proceeds from His brain, the most concealed of all.&quot;</p>
<p>185. &quot;And when that comes forth all the inferior spirits are aroused with 
  Him.&quot;</p>
<p>186. &quot;And who are they? They are the holy crowns of Small Face.</p>
<p>187. &quot;And there are six other spirits which are given. They are those 
  of whom it is written: The Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of 
  Counsel and Strength, and the Spirit of Knowledge and of the Fear of the Lord 
  YHVH.&quot;</p>
<p>188. &quot;For thus is the tradition: It is written (I Kings 2.12): And Solomon 
  sat upon the throne of David. Also it is written (I Kings 10.19): The throne 
  had six steps.&quot;</p>
<p>189. &quot;And King Messiah will be seated on those seven. These are those 
  six, and the Spirit of the Ancient of Days, Who is above them, is the seventh.&quot;</p>
<p>190. &quot;Like it is said: There are three spirits that comprehend three others.&quot;</p>
<p>191. Rabbi Shimeon said unto him; &quot;Your spirit shall rest in the world 
  to come.&quot;</p>
<p>192. Come -- behold! It is written (Ezekiel 37.9): &quot;Thus says the Lord 
  YHVH, 'Come from the four winds (Sefiroth), O Spirit!&quot; But what have the 
  four winds of the world to do with this?</p>
<p>193. Nevertheless, the four winds are aroused--those three, namely, and the 
  Spirit of the Concealed Ancient One, whence there are four.</p>
<p>194. And thus is the matter: because when that one is produced, three others 
  are produced with it who in themselves comprehend three others.</p>
<p>195. But it is the will of the Holy and Blessed One to produce the One Spirit, 
  Who in Himself includes all others.</p>
<p>196. Because it is written (Ezekiel 37.9): &quot;From the four spirits, come, 
  O Spirit! It is not written thus: &quot;Ye four spirits, come!&quot; but &quot;From 
  the four spirits, come!&quot;</p>
<p>197. And in the days of King Messiah there shall be no need that one should 
  teach another; for that One Spirit (Ruach Echad) Who in Himself includes all 
  spirits, knows all Wisdom and Understanding, Counsel and Might, and is the Spirit 
  of Knowledge and Fear of the Lord YHVH; because He is the Spirit comprehending 
  all spirits.</p>
<p>198. Therefore is it written, &quot;From the four spirits;&quot; which are 
  those four comprehended in the seven steps of which we have just spoken.</p>
<p>199, And this is the tradition: All things are comprehended in this Spirit 
  of the Ancient of Ancient Ones, Who proceeds from the concealed brain, into 
  the gallery of the nostrils.</p>
<p>200. And come--see! Wherein is the difference between the nose (of Vast Face) 
  and the nose (of Small Face).</p>
<p>201. The nose of the Ancient of Days is life in every part. Concerning the 
  nose of Small Face it is written (Psalms 18.8): &quot;There went up smoke out 
  of His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth devoured.&quot;</p>
<p>202. There goes up a smoke through His nostrils, and out of that smoke is a 
  fire kindled.</p>
<p>203. When that smoke goes up, what afterwards follows? Coals are kindled by 
  it. What is the meaning of this &quot;By it?&quot; By that smoke, out of that 
  nose, out of that fire.</p>
<p>204. This is the tradition: When Rav Hammenuna the elder wished to offer up 
  his prayer, he said, &quot;I pray unto the Lord of the Nostrils, unto the Lord 
  of the Nostrils I do pray.&quot;</p>
<p>205. And this is that which is written (Isaiah 48.9): &quot;In my praise (My 
  nose) will I withdraw My nostrils from you.&quot; In which place the sentence 
  is concerning the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>206. This is the tradition: The size of this nose is so vast that three hundred 
  and seventy-five worlds are supported by it, which all adhere unto Small Face.</p>
<p>207. This is the praise of the confirmation of the nose.</p>
<p>208. And this, and all forms of the Ancient of Days, are seen, and are NOT 
  (Lo) seen; they are seen by the lords of lords--by pious men-- and they are 
  NOT (Lo) seen by any others.</p>

<p>9. Work of the Chariot Translations</p>
<p>Idra Zuta Qadusha</p>
<p>LESSER HOLY ASSEMBLY<br>
  From the Book of Splendor (Sefer HaZohar)</p>
<p>The following translation is the Work of the Chariot edition of the Lesser 
  Holy Assembly published in 1970.Verses from the Torah are written in Bold Italic. 
  Verses from the Prophets and Writings and are written in Bold. </p>
<p><br>
  TRADITION: On the day that Rabbi Shimeon was destined to leave this world, he 
  was putting his affairs in order, when the companions entered his house. Present 
  with him was Rabbi Eleazar his son, and Rabbi Abba, and the rest of the companions. 
  The house was full.</p>
<p>2. Rabbi Shimeon raised his eyes and saw that the house was full. </p>
<p>3. Rabbi Shimeon wept and said, &quot;On another occasion when I was sick, 
  Rabbi Fineyas son of Yayar was present with me and remained until I had chosen 
  my place, and life had been restored to me until now. When I was restored, fire 
  surrounded me, which hitherto has never ceased, and no man entered unto me without 
  permission, but now I see that it has stopped and the house is full.&quot; </p>
<p>4. While they were sitting, Rabbi Shimeon opened his eyes and saw what he saw, 
  and fire went around the house. They all went out except for Rabbi Eleazar his 
  son and Rabbi Abba. The rest of the company stayed outside.</p>
<p>5. Rabbi Shimeon said to Rabbi Eleazar his son, &quot;Go out and see if Rabbi 
  Yitza'aq is here, for I am his guarantor; tell him that he should arrange my 
  affairs, and that he should sit by my side, he whose portion is worthy. </p>
<p>6. Rabbi Shimeon arose and sat and laughed and rejoiced; he said, &quot;Where 
  are the Companions?&quot;</p>
<p>7. Rabbi Eleazar arose and brought them in, and they sat down in his presence, 
  Rabbi Shimeon lifted his hands and prayed and was rejoicing, and he said: &quot;Let 
  those Companions who were in the former Assembly meet here.&quot; </p>
<p>8. The others went out, and Rabbi Eleazar his son, and Rabbi Abba and Rabbi 
  Yehudah and Rabbi Yosi, son of Ya'aqov and Rabbi Chiya remained.</p>
<p>9. Meanwhile Rabbi Yitza'aq entered, Rabbi Shimeon said to him, &quot;How pleasant 
  is your portion, how much joy shall be added to you this day.&quot; Rabbi Abba 
  was sitting behind his shoulders, and Rabbi Eleazar facing him.</p>
<p>10. Rabbi Shimeon said, &quot;Now indeed is a time of favor, and I have to 
  ascend without shame to the world to come.&quot;</p>
<p>11. &quot;And behold holy matters of NOT (Lo) which previously have been revealed, 
  I desire to reveal before the Divine Presence of NOT; lest they should say that 
  I have kept back anything, and that I left the world deficient. For even until 
  now these things have been concealed in my heart, so that having entered into 
  these very matters I may be with them in the world to come. But this is my arrangement 
  of you: Rabbi Abba shall write, and Rabbi Eleazar my son, study, and the rest 
  of the Companions in silence meditate in their hearts; Rabbi Abba arose from 
  behind his shoulders and Rabbi Eleazar his son sat in front of him; he said. 
  &quot;Arise my son, for another shall sit in that place;&quot; Rabbi Eleazar 
  arose. Rabbi Shimeon wrapped himself and sat down; he opened and said (Psalms 
  115): &quot;The dead shall NOT-praise YH. And all who will go down in silence.&quot; 
  &quot;The dead will NOT-praise YH,&quot; here it is certain who is called &quot;dead,&quot; 
  for the Holy One, blessed be He, is called &quot;Living&quot; (Chayyim), and 
  He is commemorated among those who are called living, and NOT among the people 
  who are called dead.</p>
<p>12. And it is written in the latter part of this verse, &quot;And all who will 
  go down into silence,&quot; and all those who descend to silence remain in Gehinnom.</p>
<p>13. There is another reason pertaining to those who are called &quot;living,&quot; 
  for the Holy One, blessed be He, desires their glory.</p>
<p>14. Rabbi Shimeon said, &quot;How different it now is from when we were in 
  the former Assembly.&quot;</p>
<p>15. For there was present the Holy One, blessed be He, with His Chariot (Merkabah).</p>
<p>16. But now the Holy One, blessed be He, is here, and He comes with those righteous 
  ones who are in the Garden of Eden (Gan Aden), which did not happen at the former 
  Assembly.</p>
<p>17. And the Holy One, blessed be He, cares for the honor of the righteous more 
  than for His own honor, as it is written in the case of Jeroboam, who offered 
  incense and worshipped idols. And the Holy One, blessed be He, was long-suffering 
  with him; but because he extended his hand against Ido the prophet, his hand 
  became withered; for it is written (I Kings 13.4): &quot;And his hand became 
  withered.&quot;</p>
<p>18. Here it is not written that it was because he worshipped idols, but because 
  he extended his hand against Ido the prophet.</p>
<p>19. And now the Holy One, blessed be He, wants our honor, and they all come 
  with Him.</p>
<p>20. He said, indeed, Rab Hamnuna the elder is here and around him are seventy 
  righteous ones represented in his circle, each one with the splendor of the 
  brightness of the Holy Ancient One, Mystery of all Mysteries.</p>
<p>21. And he comes to hear with joy these things which I will say.</p>
<p>22. And when he had sat down...</p>
<p>23. He said, &quot;Behold Rabbi Fineyas, son of Yayer is here, make ready his 
  place; the companions who were there trembled greatly, and they arose and sat 
  down in the lower part of the house.</p>
<p>24. And Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba remained with Rabbi Shimeon.</p>
<p>25. In the former Assembly I found that the whole company spoke, as I did.</p>
<p>26. Now I alone will speak.</p>
<p>27. And they will all listen to my words both those in heaven and on earth.</p>
<p>28. Worthy is my portion today.</p>
<p>29. Rabbi Shimeon opened and said (Song of Songs7): &quot;I am my Beloved's, 
  and His desire will arise.&quot; </p>
<p>30. All the days that I was perfumed in this world, I was perfumed with One 
  perfume,<br>
  namely the Holy One, blessed be He, and therefore, now &quot;His desire will 
  arise.&quot;</p>
<p>31. For He Himself and His whole holy company come, so that with joy they may 
  hear the secret words, and the praise of Him, the Most Holy Ancient One.</p>
<p>32. Mystery of all mysteries.</p>
<p>33. Separate and set apart from all, and NOT separate.</p>
<p>34. For everything is joined in YH,<br>
  And He (Hu) is joined within all,<br>
  He is all,<br>
  The Ancient One of all Ancient Ones,<br>
  Mystery of all mysteries,<br>
  Conformed and NOT conformed. </p>
<p>35. He is formed in all that endures, and NOT conformed in all that is NOT 
  manifest.</p>
<p>36. When He is conformed, He produces nine lights, which shine forth from Him, 
  from His conformations, and those lights shine from Him and are lit from Him 
  and they proceed and are spread out in all directions.</p>
<p>37. As a lamp from which Light is spread out in all directions. </p>
<p>38. And as those rays which spread out, when they are approached to know them, 
  are NOT found, except for the lamp alone; so is He, the Holy Ancient One, the 
  highest lamp, mystery of all mysteries.</p>
<p>39. And He is NOT found, except for those rays that are extended, those that 
  are revealed, and those that are revealed and hidden.</p>
<p>40. And they are called the Holy Name, and therefore are all things One (Echad). 
  And what our companions said in the former books, that these are degrees that 
  had been created and the Holy Ancient One was revealed in every single one of 
  them, because these are the confirmations of the Holy Ancient One.</p>
<p>41. Now is not the time for these things for I have said them in the Holy Assembly. 
</p>
<p>42. And I have seen What (Mah) of NOT, which I knew until now, and I have hidden 
  the matters of my heart.</p>
<p>43. And now I alone will describe these things before the Holy King, and all 
  those worthy of truth who have come to hear these things.</p>
<p>44. Skull of the White Head has beginning and end in NOT, the sphere whose 
  parts are extended and illumined and from which the just shall inherit four 
  hundred special worlds in the world to come. </p>
<p>45. From this sphere with parts, which is the White Skull (Vast Face), dew 
  drops every day onto Small Face to the place which is called &quot;Heaven,&quot; 
  and where the dead are waiting ready to be revived in the time to come, as it 
  is written (Torah B'reshith 4.28): &quot;Therefore Elohim will give you of the 
  dew of Heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>46. And His Head (Rosh) is filled with that dew, and from Small Face it drops 
  to the field of apples, and all the field of apples shines from that dew.</p>
<p>47. He, the Most Holy Ancient One, is hidden and concealed.</p>
<p>48. And the supernal wisdom is found in that Skull,<br>
  Found and found as NOT;<br>
  In Him, the Ancient One, Nothing, is revealed except the Head alone,<br>
  Because it is the Head of all Heads.</p>
<p>49. The supernal wisdom, which is the Head within Yod y, is hidden therein, 
  and is called the supernal brain,</p>
<p>50. The hidden brain,</p>
<p>51. The tranquil and calm brain,</p>
<p>52. Of which None knows except hy, the Son Himself.</p>
<p>53. Three Heads have been formed within the other.</p>
<p>54. And One is above the other.</p>
<p>55. The Head (Rosh) of One is the hidden wisdom which is covered and opened 
  up in NOT, and this wisdom is mysterious, the Head of all Heads of the other 
  wisdoms.</p>
<p>56. The Head of Above, Holy Ancient One, mystery of all mysteries.</p>
<p>57. Head of all Heads, <br>
  The Head which is of NOT,<br>
  Known as NOT.<br>
  What is knowable in the Head is NOT connected with wisdom<br>
  And NOT connected with understanding.</p>
<p>58. And concerning this, read (Balaq 1.81): &quot;Flee to your place.&quot;</p>
<p>59 (Ezekiel 1): &quot;And the Chayot ran and returned,&quot;</p>
<p>60. And for this reason the Holy Ancient One is called NOT.</p>
<p>61. THAT (Asher) in hy depends on NOT.</p>
<p>62. And all those hairs,</p>
<p>63. And all those threads go out from the hidden brain, and they are all disposed 
  in the weight. </p>
<p>64. And NOT is seen as the back [of Small Face], ALL HE (Kol Hu). </p>
<p>65. Because this Holy Ancient One is within One form!</p>
<p><br>
  66. Everything is in joy, and He does not change His mercy forever, in thirteen 
  measures of mercy is He found. </p>
<p>67. And He, the Ancient One, includes them and rules over all.</p>
<p>68. One, which shines in the midst of the hairs going forth from the skull, 
  is that path by whose light the righteous are led into the world to come, as 
  it is written (Proverbs 4): &quot;And the path of the righteous is as a shining 
  light...&quot;</p>
<p>69. And concerning this it is written (Isaiah 58): &quot;You will delight yourself 
  in the Lord YHVH.&quot;</p>
<p>70. And from this path all the other paths that depend on the Small Countenance 
  are illumined.</p>
<p>71. This Ancient One is elder of elders.</p>
<p>72. (He is the&#133;) highest Crown of above with which are adorned in YH all 
  adornments and crowns.</p>
<p>73. And from Him are all the lights illuminated, and they shine; but He, He 
  is the Supreme Light, which is hidden and known as NOT.</p>
<p>74. (And all other lights are kindled by Him and shine.)</p>
<p>75. This Ancient One is found in three heads and they are included in one Head.</p>
<p>76. And He Himself is the supreme Head, highest of the highest.</p>
<p>77. And because the Holy Ancient One is formed in three, so also, all the other 
  lights that shine from Him are formed into three.</p>
<p>78. Further, the Ancient One is engraved in two.</p>
<p>79. This is the division of the Ancient One into two.</p>
<p>80. The Crown (Keter) is the highest of the high ones, Head of all Heads.</p>
<p>81. And HE Himself is that Superior Head, which is known as NOT.</p>
<p>82. So are all the other lights hidden in the two.</p>
<p>83. Further, the Holy Ancient One is formed and hidden in One, <br>
  And He is One,<br>
  And all are That One (Asher Echad),<br>
  Thus all the other lights are sanctified, are restricted, and are glorified 
  in One,<br>
  And they are One.</p>
<p>84. The forehead which is uncovered in the Holy Ancient One,<br>
  Is called &quot;Grace (Ratzon, also Will).&quot;<br>
  For that Supernal Head,<br>
  Concealed in the higher which is known as NOT,<br>
  An ornamented, comely, perfumed prince<br>
  Which is contained in the forehead.</p>
<p>85. And because the Grace of all Graces is perfected in the forehead and revealed 
  in that direction, this forehead is called &quot;Grace.&quot;</p>
<p>86. And this Grace is revealed.</p>
<p>87. The Grace of Graces is found in all worlds, and all the prayers of the 
  inferiors are accepted, and the countenance of Small Face is illuminated.</p>
<p>88. And everything is found to be mercy and all judgments are concealed, and 
  upset on the Sabbath at the time of the afternoon prayers, which is the time 
  when all judgments are awakened. And this forehead is revealed, and all judgments 
  are upset and mercy is manifested in all the worlds.</p>
<p>89. And because of this the Sabbath exists without heavenly or earthly judgments, 
  and even the fire of Gehinnom is stilled in its place, and the guilty have repose.</p>
<p>90. And to this is added a soul of joy on the Sabbath, and men should rejoice 
  in the three Sabbath meals for all faith and the sum of faith is therein manifested.</p>
<p>91. And men should prepare a dish and eat...</p>
<p>92. Three meals of faith, and rejoice in them.</p>
<p>93. Rabbi Shimeon said, &quot;I call as witnesses on my behalf all those here 
  assembled, that I have never missed those three meals, and through them, I have 
  never had to fast on the Sabbath, nor even on weekdays. How much less so on 
  the Sabbath, for he who has the privilege of them, has the privilege of the 
  completeness of faithfulness?</p>
<p>94. One is the meal of the Great Mother,</p>
<p>95. One is the meal of the Holy King,</p>
<p>96. And one is the meal of the Holy Ancient One, mystery of all mysteries. 
  And in that world, they will have the privilege of them.</p>
<p>97. When this Grace is revealed, all judgments are upset in their sequence.<br>
  The perfection of the Holy Ancient One is made in One Perfection,<br>
  The sum of all Perfections,<br>
  Which is the upper secret wisdom, <br>
  The sum of all the others,<br>
  And this is called the 'secret upper Eden.' <br>
  And it is the brain of the Holy Ancient One,<br>
  And this brain spreads out in all directions,<br>
  And from it another Eden spreads out,<br>
  And from this Eden, It is shaped.<br>
  And that secret head, which is in the head of the Ancient One, is known as NOT.<br>
  When one manner, which is perfected to shine, spreads out, <br>
  It touches this brain.<br>
  And It is formed and made to shine with several lights,<br>
  And It goes out and engraves like this ornament which is in the Forehead.<br>
  And a light, which is called 'Grace' is engraved in It,<br>
  And this Grace is spread out to the Earth in the beard <br>
  As far as That Place which rests in the beard.<br>
  And It is called 'supernal loving kindness,' <br>
  And this is the preserving kindness.<br>
  And when this Grace is uncovered,<br>
  All the Lords of Judgment behold It, and are turned aside.</p>
<p>98. The eyes of the Head of the Holy Ancient One are two in one, equal, which 
  are ever watchful,</p>
<p>99. And do not sleep, as it is written (Psalms 121): &quot;The Guardian of 
  Israel shall not sleep and not slumber,&quot; meaning Israel the Holy; and for 
  this reason He has no eyelashes, and no eyelids on the eyes.</p>
<p>100. That Brain is formed and shines with three supernal white brilliances.</p>
<p>101. With one white brilliance are the eyes of Small Face bathed, as it is 
  written <br>
  (Song of Songs 5): &quot;swimming in milk,&quot; which is that primordial white 
  brilliance, and the other lights are bathed in and shine from the other white 
  brilliances.</p>
<p>102. The brain is called &quot;the fountain of blessing;&quot; the fountain, 
  because all blessings are found therein.<br>
  103. And this brain is lit with three white brilliances of the eye.</p>
<p>104. On the eye depends the blessing of YH, as it is written (Proverbs 22): 
  &quot;Goodly of eye, he shall be blessed,&quot; for the white brilliance of 
  the eye depends on the brain.</p>
<p>105. When this eye looks upon Small Face (worlds),</p>
<p>106. (a.v. &quot;all the Face shines with joy&quot;) they all shine with joy.</p>
<p>107. (With) this eye He restrains the Right Hand; by YH there is no Left Hand.</p>
<p>108. The eyes of below are right and left, two with two colors.</p>
<p>109. We have taught in the Book of THAT Which is Concealed, that there is &quot;Yod 
  above, Yod below.&quot;</p>
<p>110. &quot;Heh above, Heh below.&quot;</p>
<p>111. &quot;Vav above, Vav below.&quot;</p>
<p>112. All these ones of above depend on the Ancient One.</p>
<p>113. The ones of below are in Small Face.</p>
<p>114. They are dependent on NOT, and these are actually in It.</p>
<p>115. And they depend on the Holy Ancient One.</p>
<p>116. For the Name of the Ancient One is concealed from all, and is found as 
  NOT, except in those letters which depend on the Ancient One, so that they should 
  exist on Earth.</p>
<p>117. And if it were not so, they would NOT exist.</p>
<p>118. And for this reason, the Name of the Holy One is the Secret (dvc, Sod) 
  and That, which is the Secret in relation to it, is revealed. For the Holy Ancient 
  One is the Secret of All.</p>
<p>119. And That (Hu) is revealed, and from That is Small Face, and all these 
  blessings of the secret eye are revealed, and those secret letters that are 
  dependent are revealed.</p>
<p>120. The nose, from the nose of This (Zeh), from the nostril to the chest on 
  which the breath of life is blown to Small Face.</p>
<p>121. And from that opening of the nose, from those openings of the nostrils 
  depends the [superior] Heh h, in order to establish the other inferior Heh.</p>
<p>122. And this breath proceeds from the Hidden Brain and She is called the Spirit 
  of Life, and through that Spirit will all men understand wisdom in the time 
  of King Messiah.</p>
<p>123. As it is written (Isaiah 11): &quot;And the Spirit of the Lord YHVH shall 
  rest upon Him, a Spirit of wisdom and understanding...&quot;</p>
<p>124. This nose is life and perfect joy in every part,</p>
<p>125. The repose of Spirit,</p>
<p>126. And Health.</p>
<p>127. Concerning the nose of Small Face (as we have learned by tradition),<br>
  it is written (Psalms 18.9): &quot;Smoke came out of His nostrils...&quot;</p>
<p>128. But it is written (Isaiah 48.9): &quot;And for my praise, will I refrain 
  from you.&quot;</p>
<p>129. And in the Book of Aggadah of Rabbi Yiba the Elder:<br>
  &quot;The Heh is established in the mouth,<br>
  And here NOT is fulfilled so,<br>
  And NOT brings the combination (as we need it),<br>
  It ascends in One,<br>
  These judgments depend on the Heh,<br>
  And judgments depend on the nose,<br>
  As it is written: &quot;There went up a smoke out of His nostrils...&quot;</p>
<p>130. And if you object, saying, behold, it is written (Psalms 18:9): &quot;and 
  consuming fire came out of His mouth...&quot;</p>
<p>131. The root of anger depends on the Nose.<br>
  All the conformations of the Holy Ancient One are perfected <br>
  By the quiet mysterious brain.<br>
  And all the conformations of Small Face are formed<br>
  Through the inferior wisdom.<br>
  As it is written (Psalms 104.24): &quot;All these have You made in wisdom.&quot;<br>
  And the Heh is the sum of all things.</p>
<p>132. What is the difference between the [inferior] Heh and [the superior] Heh 
  ? By this [inferior] Heh judgment is awakened, and by that [superior] Heh mercy 
  within mercy. <br>

  Book of (the Angelic Secrets of) Raziel the Great One</p>
<p><br>
  1. RABBI YISMAEL SAID: &quot;Metatron the Great Lord said to me: I bear this 
  testimony on behalf of the Lord YHVH, Elohim of Israel, the Living and Enduring 
  El, our Lord and Master:<br>
  - That His height, from His Seat of Glory and up (is) 118 ten thousands<br>
  parasangs (rebaboth),<br>
  - From His Seat of Glory down (is) 118 ten thousands parasangs (rebaboth),<br>
  - His total height 236 ten thousand thousands parasangs. <br>
  - From His Right Arm to His Left Arm (is) 77 ten thousand (parasangs).<br>
  - From His Right Eye to (His) Left Eye (is) 30 ten thousands (parasangs). <br>
  - The Skull on His Head (is) three and one third ten thousand (parasangs). <br>
  - The Crowns on His Head (amount to) 60 ten thousands (parasangs) equaling the 
  60 ten thousands of the tribes of Israel. <br>
  Therefore is He called the Great, the Mighty and the Awesome El : KLYTYH YDYDVT 
  EL CHY KLTA 'AVVTA HMQVQ TQTF HQTF HQTM QTF B'ABVR MSVS<br>
  &quot;Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>2. It is said that he who knows this mystery is assured of his portion in the 
  world to come (is assured to be a son (daughter) of the world to come), and 
  will be saved from the punishment of Gehinnom (Hell), and from all kind of punishments 
  and evil decrees about to befall the world, and will be saved from all kind 
  of witchcraft, for He saves us, protects us, redeems us, and rescues me __________ 
  from all evil things, from all harsh decrees, and from all kinds of punishments 
  for the sake of His Great Name.</p>
<p>3. (A long hymn follows in alphabetical order, the alphabet being repeated 
  several times, the hymn concludes with the verse:)<br>
  &quot;Lord of Hosts, happy is the man that trusts in You.&quot; (Psalms 84:13)</p>
<p>4. RABBI YISHMAEL SAID: &quot;I have seen the King of Kings sitting on a high 
  and exalted throne. His hosts stand before Him on His right and on His left, 
  with the Lord of the Presence (Sar Hapanim) whose name is Metatron: RVH, PYSQVNY&quot;H, 
  PSQY&quot;N, ATM&quot;VN, HYGR&quot;VN, SYGR&quot;VN, SRT&quot;VN, SNYGR&quot;VN, 
  MYQ&quot;VN, HSKV&quot;M, STY&quot;M, HSK&quot;M, HQYR&quot;YN, N&quot;A, DVQYR&quot;YN, 
  ZYN&quot;A, RB&quot;A, NNTV&quot;S, ZNTV&quot;F, HKYQ&quot;M.</p>
<p>5. RABBI YISHMAEL SAID: &quot;What is the measure of the Holy One, Blessed 
  be He, who is hidden from all creatures? The soles of His feet fill the whole 
  world, as it is said (Isaiah 66:1): &quot;The heaven is my throne, and the earth 
  is my foot-stool.&quot; <br>
  The height of each sole is three ten thousand thousands of parasangs.<br>
  The sole of His right foot is called PRSYMYA, ATRQTT and His left sole (is called) 
  AGTMN.<br>
  From the sole of His feet to His ankles (the height is) one thousand ten thousands 
  and five hundred parasangs, and the same for His left (ankle).<br>
  The name of the right ankle (is) TZNMTNYH, TSSQM, and the name of His left ankle 
  is ASTMN.<br>
  From His ankles to His knees the height (is) nineteen thousand ten thousands 
  and four parasangs, both right and left.<br>
  The name of His left leg (is) QNGGY, MHRYH, TSSQVM, and of the right (leg) (is) 
  MMGA, VZVYA.<br>
  The height from His knees to His thighs (is) twelve thousand ten thousands and 
  fourteen hundred parasangs, both right and left. His name: MMGA, VZVYA. <br>
  The right thigh is called SSPVST, PRSB, and the left (thigh) is called TFGT, 
  HZYZA.<br>
  From His thighs to His neck (the height is) twenty-four thousand ten thousands 
  of parasangs.<br>
  The name of His loin of loins (is) MVTNYHV, ATSGH, YDYDYH.<br>
  On His Heart are inscribed seventy names: <br>
  (list of Hebrew Names not available in HTML)<br>
  &quot;Baruch Shem Kavod Malkuto L'Olam Va'ed.&quot; <br>
  (Blessed be the Name of the glory of His kingdom forever.)<br>
  His neck: Thirteen thousand ten thousands and eight hundred parasangs (is) the 
  height of His neck, its name: SNNYHV, VBHTYQN.<br>
  The roundness of His head (circumference) (is) three hundred thousand ten thousands 
  and thirty-three and one third parasangs, which the mouth cannot express and 
  the ear cannot hear, its name: ATR, HVDRYH, ATSYH, ATTYH.<br>
  His beard (is) eleven thousand five hundred (one ten thousand and one thousand 
  and five hundred) parasangs, its name: HDRRQ, SMYA.<br>
  The appearance of the countenance as the appearance of the cheeks, (as well 
  as the appearance of the cheeks) is like unto the likeness of the Ruach [i.e. 
  Ruach HaQodesh] and in the form of the Divine Soul ( Neshamah) (which) no creature 
  is able to mention or describe.<br>
  His Astral Shell (geviyah) like chrysolite (tarsis).<br>
  His splendor (ziv) glitters awesomely from out of the midst of the darkness 
  (Psalms 18:12 and 2 Samuel 22:12).<br>
  Clouds and thick darkness (anan v'arafel) surround Him (Psalms 97:2).<br>
  All Lords of the Presence (Sare He'anim) stand before Him as ordained (k'tikun).<br>
  (For the nose and the tongue) we do not have a measure, only names are revealed 
  to us. The name of the nose: LGBTYYA, and also ABRGG, TTPYYH.<br>
  His tongue (reaches) from one end of the World to the other, for it is said 
  (Psalms 147:19): &quot;He declares His Word unto Jacob, His statutes and His 
  ordinances unto Israel.&quot; He who knows not (how) to conclude this verse 
  is in error for it is said: &quot;He declares&quot; its (the tongue) name ASSGYYHV, 
  VAYYA.<br>
  His forehead is called MSSGYYHV, YNAYYA, NGM. <br>
  On His forehead is inscribed: <br>
  (Hebrew font not available in HTML)<br>
  YYHV HY HV YH <br>
  HH HY VYHV YH YHV<br>
  YVH HA HH YA YHVH<br>
  VYH HH YH HV HA<br>
  AH VVH AY HV HYH<br>
  HY YYY HH YYHYY VYH<br>
  The black of His eye (is) 11,500 parasangs, similarly His left eye.<br>
  The right (eye) is named: AZRYYH, ATTYTVS.<br>
  The Lord (of the eye?) is called RHBEL (RHBYEL or RHBEL).<br>
  The left (eye) is called MTT, GRVFMTzYA, and the sparks that issue (emanate) 
  from them (from it) give light to all creatures.<br>
  The white of His right eye (measures) twenty-two ten thousand and two parasangs, 
  similarly (that of) His left (eye), and is named: BZQVHA.<br>
  From His right shoulder to His left shoulder (is) sixteen thousand ten thousands 
  parasangs,<br>
  The right shoulder is named: MTTGRYAA, 'ANGN.<br>
  The left (shoulder) is called TTMHYNTA, it also has another name SLMH YNNYEL 
  (alternate reading: and it has one name, meaning that the two shoulders have 
  one name in common).<br>
  From His right arm to His left arm (is) twelve thousand ten thousands parasangs.<br>
  His arm (are) double [The meaning is, perhaps, that the two arms together are 
  double the size mentioned before, namely twenty-four thousand ten thousands 
  parasangs].<br>
  The name of the right arm (is) GBRHZZYA, AKBVY, <br>
  and of the left (arm) MTTGHTzTzYVH.<br>
  The (size of) the fingers of His hands: each finger (is) fifteen thousand ten 
  thousands parasangs, both of the right and of the left.<br>
  (The name of the fingers or of each finger) of the right (hand): TTMTzMTz, GGMVT, 
  GGSMS, and of the left (hand) TTz, MF, TTMT, AGGMZ, AGGMT, SVSNYM (the last 
  name is Shoshanim, roses). This way, you count beginning with the thumb.<br>
  The palms of His hands (are) four thousand ten thousands parasangs, both the 
  right and the left (hands).<br>
  The right (hand) is named: HZZYA, ATGRYYA, and the left (hand) is named: ASHVZYH.<br>
  The fingers (toes) of His feet (are) ten thousand ten thousands parasangs, each 
  finger (toe) on both right and left (feet).<br>
  The name of the right (toes): ATRMTz, ADRMT, BRMNM, BRTHMYM, VAHVZ; and (the 
  names of the) left (toes): ZKYYN, KZKYYN, HTMT, AHVZ. You count the way you 
  count those of the hand (namely beginning with the big toe).<br>
  Therefore, is He called: the Great, the Mighty, the Awesome El, for it is said 
  (Torah Doverim 10:17): &quot;For the Lord YHVH your Elohim, HE is Elohim of 
  Elohim, Lord of Lords, the great El, the Mighty and the Awesome.&quot;</p>
<p>6. HE SAID TO ME: &quot;The size of the parasangs, what they measure: each 
  parasang consists of three mils, each mil contains ten thousand cubits, each 
  cubit two spans (Zereth), and His span fills the whole world (olam, also universe). 
  As it is written (Isaiah 40:12): &quot;Who has measured in the hollow of His 
  hand the waters, and meted out the Heavens with His span.&quot; </p>
<p>7. RABBI NATHAN, THE PUPIL OF R. YISHMAEL SAID: He also gave me the measure 
  of the nose right and left, as well as that of the lips and cheeks. Also he 
  gave me the measure of the forehead, he also set down rules for every cubit.<br>
  The width of the forehead is equal to the height of the neck, and so is the 
  shoulder.<br>
  The length of the nose (is) like the length of the small finger.<br>
  The height of the cheek is equal to half the roundness of the head.<br>
  These measures are also found in human beings.<br>
  (In size of) His lips: seventy-seven parasangs.<br>
  His upper lip is called GBRH, TYA, and the lower one HZRGYA.<br>
  His mouth is fire consuming fire.<br>
  When He speaks its name (is) ASDRA.<br>
  -(the next five words are not translatable) The crown on His head (is) five 
  hundred thousand by found hundred thousand (parasangs); its name is VYS.<br>
  The precious stone between its horns [rays?] is called YS AMV ALY YS AMI ALY 
  is engraved upon it.<br>
  My friend is white and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.<br>
  His head is bright as the finest gold,<br>
  His locks are like waving foliage and black as a raven.<br>
  His eyes are doves by streamlets of water.<br>
  His cheeks are like a bed of roses...<br>
  Two thousand ten thousands parasangs.<br>
  And whoever does not conclude with this verse (Shir HaShirim 5:10-16) is in 
  error:<br>
  &quot;His cheeks are like a bed of roses,<br>
  As banks of sweet herbs;<br>
  His lips are as lilies,<br>
  Dropping with flowing myrrh.<br>
  His hands are as rods of gold, set with beryl.<br>
  His body is as polished ivory, overlaid with sapphires.<br>
  His legs are as pillars of marble,<br>
  Set upon sockets of fine gold.<br>
  His aspect is like Lebanon,<br>
  Excellent as the cedars.<br>
  His mouth is most sweet.<br>
  Yea, He is altogether lovely.<br>
  This is my beloved, and this is my friend,<br>
  O daughters of Jerusalem.&quot;<br>
  AGTYH, THVN, YHVN, TVB, THVR, YVD, YVD, YHYH, HSYN, HSYN<br>
  &quot;Holy Holy Holy is the Lord YHVH of Hosts, the whole earth is full of His 
  Glory.&quot; (Isaiah 6:3)<br>
  (The measure of ) His eyelids, like the measure of His eyes&#133;<br>
  The right (eye) is named HDR, VVLD; the left (eye is named) APDH <br>
  (in Lemberg APRH), TzTzYHV.<br>
  The height of His ears (is) like the height of His forehead.<br>
  The right (ear) is called ATzTHYYA; the left (ear is called) MNVGHV.<br>
  Hence, the total measure [of the Divine Stature] is ten thousand of ten thousands 
  ten thousand thousand parasangs in height, and one thousand thousand ten thousands 
  of parasangs in width. </p>
<p>8. RABBI YISHMAEL TOLD THIS (THING) TO RABBI AQIBA. HE SAID TO ME: &quot;He 
  who knows this measure of our Creator, and the praise of the Holy One, blessed 
  be He, Who is hidden from the creatures, is assured that he is the son of the 
  world to come. (He will inherit the world to come), and will have in this world 
  the good of the other world, and will live long in this world.</p>
<p>9. RABBI YISHMAEL SAID TO ME (the above mentioned Rabbi Nathan?) in the presence 
  of his pupils. I and Rabbi Aqiba vouch for this, that whoever knows this measure 
  of our Creator, and the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He, he will surely 
  be a son of the world to come, provided he learns it regularly every day:<br>
  His body fills the Throne of Fire of the Torah.<br>
  His name: BG, BG, GB, HVMG.<br>
  His locks (of) His body are named: DBR, BRYR, DVBG.<br>
  They have half of a nickname called: GL, SRB.<br>
  One of His eyes with which He sees from one end of the world to the other is 
  named: AKSST, the sparks issuing from it give light to all creatures; the other 
  one, which sees backwards (with which He sees in advance), what is going to 
  happen in the future, is named ATNVGST.<br>
  His body is like unto a bow, the bow is like unto its name: LQSSYS, half of 
  it is named MN, KMTz.<br>
  His sword is called MTzMTzYT, MTzYA.<br>
  His Throne of Glory is named LVRKZ, PYRVTA.<br>
  The place of His seat is called DVRPZ, PRVRPZ this is also His nickname.<br>
  The feet of His glory are the Chayot. <br>
  The Chayot standing under Him.<br>
  The first foot of the Throne, which is a Chayah, is called AGLYV, HTzBYYH.<br>
  The second foot of the Throne, which is a Chayah, is called BBBK, PLBYYPTY.<br>
  The third foot of the Throne, which is a Chayah, by name KBBB, ALGYY.<br>
  The fourth foot, which is a Chayah, is called ATzBYYA, BZBZ.<br>
  The likeness of their faces... the nature of a lion, the stamp of an eagle, 
  the image of an ox, and the blank face of a man.<br>
  Each has four faces, four faces, and four faces on each corner (of a face), 
  sixty-four faces for each Chayah.<br>
  Each Chayah has four faces and (four) wings, each wing consists of four wings; 
  four wings to a face, four wings to a wing...sixty four wings to each Chayah.<br>
  The Lord of the human face is ALYH, AMTzB, AMTz, AMT, KMTz.<br>
  The names of the Lord of the lion-face (are) HVDV, DYH, HYDVAH, AL, AVRYA, HVD, 
  HVYH, TMGMTz.<br>
  The Lord of the ox-face is called [SVR in both texts] HLYH, TzMTzMMKA, MSKYA.<br>
  And the name of the Lord of the eagle-face (is) 'APPY, ALYH, MMTzYT, TzHVRYRYAL.<br>
  When Israel sinned, the ox-face was hidden away, and was replaced with a Kerub. 
  <br>
  The name of the Lord of the Kerub-face (is): TMTMNY, ALYH, KRRVBYH, KRBH, PSPSYH, 
  PTzPTzYH, HNQNQYA.<br>
  They (the Chayot) are the ones who say &quot;Holy Holy Holy...&quot; (Isaiah 
  6:3), it is they who say, &quot;Blessed be the glory...&quot; (Ekekiel 3:12) 
  as it is written (Psalms 146:19): &quot;He declares His Word unto Ya'aqov.&quot;<br>
  And he who does not conclude with Torah B'reshith, with the order of the Creation, 
  errs in the Glory of the Holy One, blessed be He. His glory fills everything, 
  hosts of thunder rage on His right. Bands of people rage on His left, and colors 
  (Simanim) rage in front of Him.<br>
  Within the colors, splendor, and darkness, cloud, thick cloud ('arafel) and 
  mire of clay (tithyaven).<br>
  In front of Him (is) a field of sown seed (zeroo'yin).<br>
  Between one star and another (is) the source of lightning.<br>
  Between one lightning and another (is) the door of Hashmal.<br>
  And above: winds, roaring, thunder and lightning, and the holy palms, and ropes 
  of seals, used for ascending and descending.<br>
  On the Holy One, blessed be He, (are) Grace (Chen), Love (Chesed), Glory (Kavod), 
  Mercy (Rachamim), Splendor (Hod), Crown ('Atehreth), Adornment (Hadar), Beauty 
  (Tifareth), and Majesty (Ge'ooth).<br>
  The Hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, (is named) Metatron.<br>
  They say: Mighty and Strong...<br>
  They say: Holy and Blessed...<br>
  And they appear before Him with a great sound (as in Ezekiel 1:24): &quot;As 
  they went, a noise like the sound of a host.&quot; They stand before Him.<br>
  The Youth (Na'ar) Metatron appears and prostrates himself before the Holy One, 
  blessed be He, His name AHH...<br>
  He praises and glorifies and says:<br>
  &quot;Blessed be the glory of the Lord YHVH from His place.&quot;<br>
  YHVH, HV, HV, YVHY, YHYYH<br>
  &quot;Blessed be the glory of the Lord YHVH from His place.&quot;<br>
  And they repeat after him: &quot;Blessed be the glory of the Lord YHVH from 
  His place,&quot; and &quot;Blessed be the Name of the glory for ever.&quot;<br>
  He (Metatron) enters in front under the Throne of Glory.<br>
  He is accompanied by stones of fire and hailstones and a wall of roaring (z'aaf) 
  on his right.<br>
  On his left, wings of storm and strength of tempest accompany him.<br>
  When Metatron enters before the Holy One, blessed be He, under the Throne of 
  Glory, he holds (the Throne) with a multitude of wings, and all the ministering 
  angels come before the Holy One, blessed be He, and say: &quot;the great, the 
  mighty, and awesome El.&quot;<br>
  They praise the Holy One, blessed be He, thrice daily through Metatron. <br>
  The Holy One, blessed be He, bestowed His splendor and His beauty on the ministering 
  Angel Metatron, the Lord of the Presence, who has been appointed grand master 
  over all the Lords and ministering angels.<br>
  They stand before him, and he stands higher and higher upwards, and ministers 
  before Adam; a fire consuming fire throne (kise) is its name.<br>
  This is the seat of Metatron, the Lord of the Presence, which is written with 
  One-Letter (Alef, the Unity) with which Heaven and Earth have been created, 
  and sealed with the ring &quot;I WILL BE THAT I WILL BE&quot; (Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh). 
  And is written with seven letters, and seven letters, and twenty-four letters, 
  and seventy-two names, and seven Holinesses (Kedushoth). And it is placed on 
  six of their names, and is engraved on twelve stones, and is written on seven 
  sounds (voices) on a height of six by six (see Book of THAT Which is Concealed...Zohar 
  II: 186b).<br>
  It was given to our teacher Mosheh (Rabbenu) in innermost chambers, in hidden 
  hiddenness, in wonder of wonders.<br>
  The Holy One, blessed be He, permitted neither Adam nor Shem, the son of Noah, 
  nor Abraham, Yitza'aq, or Ya'aqov to use it. Only to Mosheh did He give permission 
  to use it, as it is written (Torah Doverim 23:20): &quot;Behold I send an angel 
  before you,&quot; and the Holy One, blessed be He, warned Mosheh to beware of 
  Him, as it says (Torah Shmoth 23:21): &quot;Beware of Him, and obey His voice, 
  disobey Him not, for He will not pardon your transgressions because My Name 
  is in Him.&quot; And Mosheh said to the Holy One, blessed be He (Torah Shmoth 
  33:15): &quot;If Your NOT (Lo)-Presence go with me; carry us (into the) NOT 
  (Lo), up from here.&quot; <br>
  The angels that are with him (Metatron) come and surround the Throne of Glory, 
  they on one side, Chayot on the other, and the Shekhinah upon the Shekhinah 
  of Glory is in the middle. A Chayah ascends on the Serafim and descends on the 
  dwelling place of Metatron, and announces in a loud voice, in the sound of a 
  soft whisper [still small voice]: &quot;This is the Throne of Glory.&quot;<br>
  Immediately the Ofanim become silent, the angels become quiet, the Irin Kadishin 
  make haste and rush into the River of Fire (Nehr Dinur), and the Chayot turn 
  their faces down to the ground. Metatron brings the deafening fire and puts 
  it in the ears of the Chayot, that they hear not the voice of the glory of the 
  Holy One, blessed be He, and the explicit &quot;Name of Brilliant Fire&quot; 
  (Shem Ha Meforesh, YHVH) that Metatron is pronouncing at that time.<br>
  Thus is He calling the Holy One, blessed be He, by His living, pure, holy, powerful, 
  majestic, strong, beloved, mighty, glorified and awesome Name:<br>
  vhyrda yhh hvh hh<br>
  ykrha avy vhv yhyhy<br>
  HHYY HKH HH YH<br>
  YHVH HH HYA YHYH<br>
  AHYH ASR AHYH VH HVA YHVH<br>
  &quot;He who lives for ever, this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial 
  unto all generations.&quot; (Torah Shmoth 3:15). <br>
  &quot;Blessed be the Name of the glory of His Kingdom for ever.&quot; <br>
  Its interpretation in the language of purity (Metatron pronounces the Shem Ha 
  Meforesh, Brilliant Name of Fire, in the language of purity):<br>
  YHV YH HHY HYY HY<br>
  HHYV HVHY VYHH HV YHVH<br>
  HYH HYH YHY YHVH <br>
  HY VYHYV HY YHV<br>
  YH YHV HHYV HYHV<br>
  Blessed be the Name of the glory of His Kingdom for ever.<br>

<p>End of &quot;Meaure of the Divine Body&quot;</p>
<p><br>
  SH'IR QOMA<br>
  RECONSTRUCTION OF THE TEXT ACCORDING TO BEST EVIDENCE<br>
  The &quot;Meaure of the Divine Body&quot; text is known to be corrupt, as all 
  current texts come from a single corrupt text published in the 1701 Amsterdam 
  edition (Eleazar of Worms). Consequently, the dimensions taken as directly translated 
  will not lead to a reasonable image of the Yosher (upright form of the Lord 
  YHVH). However, if the following changes are made, the Yosher image that is

<p>Tree of Life<br>
  Branch Number One</p>
<p>Know that before any emanations or creatures were fashioned there was an Upper 
  Light (Or Elyon) that simply permeated all Existence, and there was no empty 
  place, in the sense of atmosphere, merely space. However, everything was imbued 
  with Infinite Light (Ayn Sof Or), to which there was no beginning nor yet any 
  end; all was Light permeating everything evenly. This is called the Infinite 
  Light (Ayn Sof Or).</p>
<p>And when He wished to create worlds and cause emanations, to bring into being 
  His perfect works, names and attributes--which was the reason for the creation 
  of the worlds, as is explained in Branch One, Part One--He then contracted (tzimtzum) 
  Himself into the middle point, in the very center. He contracted that Light 
  and removed Himself far to the perimeter round the midpoint, so that in that 
  very midpoint there remained an empty place and air and a void.</p>
<p>This contraction was on one level around that empty midpoint in such manner 
  that the space was a completely even circle all round, with no square angular 
  protrusions, since the Infinite also contracted Itself and became circular comparatively 
  on all sides. The reason for this is that the Infinite Light was symmetrical 
  with a complete symmetry, so that it felt compelled to contract itself on all 
  sides. And it is known that geometrically there is no figure of such symmetry 
  as the circle--certainly not the rectangle, with angles jutting out, nor the 
  triangle, nor any other figure.</p>
<p>He was therefore compelled to contract Himself to the shape of a circle, there 
  being no symmetry greater than that of a circle. In the Zohar Parashah Bo, &quot;a 
  vessel in the circle which is Yod&quot; [see also Parashath Pekudei of R. Nachman 
  where it is stated that the hall and their contents are circular].</p>
<p>There is a further reason: that is, for the sake of the emanations which in 
  the future will come forth in the place of that empty void space. The point 
  is that the circular emanations are all close to the Infinite which completely 
  and evenly encircles them, and the light and abundance which they require are 
  drawn equally from all sides of the Infinite. This would not be so if the emanation 
  were square or triangular or any other shape, for if one side or angle protruded 
  beyond the others, they could not receive the Infinite Light equally. At the 
  end of Branch III is given an explanation of why this limitation was necessary, 
  as well as of the whole subject.</p>
<p>This limitation was necessary in order to reveal the innermost root of the 
  laws, so as to give the attribute of the law later in the worlds, and this power 
  is known as the Hard Light.</p>
<p>Note by Chayim Vital:<br>
  In my opinion, the middle point of the Infinite was the root of the law that 
  was later revealed to be lower, and whence was made the place that is as a vessel. 
  From what surrounds that point there is extended the outer worlds, whereas from 
  the remainder of what surrounds it is extended the inner world. It is enough 
  for us not to sin and to be warned not to believe that there, at that point, 
  was the revelation of judgment. </p>
<p>May God forbid!<br>
  Tree of Life<br>
  Line of Light and the Contraction</p>
<p>Bear in mind, that before the emanations were emanated, and the creatures were 
  created, the Upper Simple Light (Or Elyon) had filled the entire Existence. 
  And there was no empty space whatsoever, namely as empty atmosphere, a hollow, 
  or pit. For everything was filled with that Simple Boundless Light (Ayn Sof 
  Or), and there was no such part as head, and no such part as tail. That is, 
  there was neither beginning nor end, for everything was simple or smooth Light 
  balanced evenly and equally in one likeness or affinity, and that is called 
  the Endless Light.</p>
<p>And when, in His simple and smooth Will, the desire arose to create the world 
  and to emanate the emanations, to bring to light the perfection of His deeds 
  and His Names and His appellations--which was the cause of the creation of the 
  world--behold He then contracted (tzimtzum) Himself in the middle point which 
  is in Him, precisely in the middle, He contracted the Light. And the Light has 
  withdrawn to the sides around the middle point, and there has remained an empty 
  space, atmosphere, and a vacuum surrounding the exact middle point. And the 
  Light has withdrawn to the sides around the middle point.</p>
<p>And behold, this contraction was equally balanced around that middle empty 
  point in such a manner that the vacuum was circular and in complete balance 
  and sameness all around.</p>
<p>It was not in the shape of a cube, which has straight angles, because the Boundless 
  also withdrew His Light in a circular form equally on all sides. This is due 
  to the fact that the Endless Itself is equal. That is, since the Endless Light 
  is in complete omniparity, it follows that It must contract Itself in omniparity 
  on all sides.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that in mathematics, or geometry, a sphere or circle 
  is the most balanced and uniform figure. This is not true of the cube with its 
  angles, or of the triangle or of any other form that might be considered. It 
  was therefore necessary for the middle point to be contracted in the form of 
  a circle. And behold, after the contraction mentioned above, It drew from the 
  Endless Light one line (Kav) direct from His circular Light from above downward, 
  and it gradually descended by evolution into that hollow or vacuum.</p>
<p>The Upper Head of the line was extended from the Endless Himself, and it contacted 
  Him. Verily, the end of that line below did not contact the Endless Light. The 
  line was drawn and extended below, and in that vacuum He emanated, created, 
  formed, and made all the collective worlds.</p>
<p>Prior to the four worlds, there was only the Endless, in the form of &quot;HE 
  IS ONE,&quot; in a wondrous concealed unity, for it is beyond the power or capacity 
  of even those angels who are near Him to conceive of it. They have no conception 
  of the Endless, blessed be He. There is no intellect created which could conceive 
  of Him, since He has No Place, and No Boundary, and No Name.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Etz HaChayyim presents the qabalistic worldview of R.Yitza'aq Luria, as 
  recorded by his student R.Chayyim Vital. The book is composed of ten &quot;branches.&quot; 
  The Work of the Chariot published an English translation of all ten branches 
  in 1973, of which Branch One follows this introduction. The texts used as a 
  basis for the Work of the Chariot translation displayed some disparities in 
  the opening section of the first branch. Rather than devise a composite, the 
  Work of the Chariot translator chose to run both of them in parallel fashion, 
  until the texts became the same.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>(singular text continuing...)</p>
<p>Now, after this contraction, when there still remained space and empty void 
  air in the middle of the Infinite Light--aswritten above--then there was a place 
  where the emanations, the creatures, the things made and formed, could be. There 
  then extended a straight line (Kav) from the Infinite Light, direct from its 
  circular light, downwards into this space. The upper part of the line extended 
  from the Infinite Itself and touched it but, below, this line did not touch 
  the Infinite Light, and the path of this line extended straight downwards to 
  the Infinite Light. From that space He brought forth emanations, created, formed, 
  and made all the worlds, this line being like a thin pipe through which Light 
  is spread out and extended from the waters of the Upper Light of the Infinite 
  to the worlds where there is air and space.</p>
<p>We shall now clarify somewhat the matter of the qabalist's investigation into 
  how there is a Head inside the Finite among the Sefiroth. Indeed, as the top 
  end of that line touches the Infinite Light on the upper side, and does not 
  extend downwards and underneath to where Infinite Light encompasses the worlds, 
  without being attached to it, then both the Head and the end are just right. 
  For if the two ends received the abundance of the Infinite, then both ends would 
  be equal Heads, so that there would be neither an upper nor a lower aspect. 
  And likewise if the Infinite extended round on all sides of the place of the 
  space, there would be neither upwards nor downwards, neither front nor back, 
  east nor west, north nor south. But as the Infinite Light extends through one 
  line and through a minute pipe, it is just right that there is up and down, 
  front and back, east and west, as will be explained in this branch in our explanatory 
  notes.</p>
<p>And lo, as the Infinite Light extends in a direct line in the midst of space, 
  it does not extend and disperse immediately to the bottom; but rather, slowly, 
  slowly. That is, at the beginning, the line of the light started to flatten 
  out; and at the beginning of this spreading out of the line in all directions--in 
  the mystic meaning--it dispersed and extended and became a sort of wheel, completely 
  round and detached from the Infinite Light, which imbues it from all sides. 
  If it becomes attached it returns to its previous condition, it disappears in 
  the Infinite Light, and its strength is NOT (Lo) seen at all, and all becomes 
  Infinite Light as it was at first. The circle is therefore close to that of 
  the Infinite and not attached to it. The only main connection, or joining of 
  the circle of the emanation with the Infinite that causes the emanation, is 
  by means of the abovementioned line through which the light descends and extends 
  from the Infinite, influencing the circle.</p>
<p>And the Infinite surrounds and encompasses it on all sides, being but an iota 
  removed from it on all sides, for that also is of a round, encompassing aspect, 
  as mentioned before, so that the illumination by the Infinite of those receiving 
  the emanations must come through this line only.</p>
<p>For if the light spread round on all sides, the recipient of the emanations 
  would be like the giver Himself, that is, limitless and boundless. Furthermore, 
  even that line, too, is very narrow and fine and does not make a wide connection, 
  so that the light extended to the emanated is in fixed amounts and measures. 
  Because of this, the emanated is called the Ten Attributes (Yod Midooth), and 
  the Ten Counts (Sefiroth), to show us that there is a fixed amount and measure 
  and a limited number, which does not apply in the case of the Infinite. As it 
  is written in the Sefer HaZohar (Parashath Pinechas): &quot;The thirteenth command 
  is the reading of the Shema... but It has no measure or specific Name in the 
  way that every Sefirah has a specific name for its measure, its boundary and 
  its limit.&quot; And since the line is thin, they will receive abundance only 
  to the extent it is required, as they are the recipients of emanations, rather 
  than the givers of emanations.</p>
<p>And behold, this first circle, most closely attached to the Infinite, is known 
  as the Crown (Keter) of Primordial Man (Adam Kadmon). After it, the line is 
  extended and continued this way, then coils round in a circle and becomes circle 
  number two within circle number one. This is known as the circle of Wisdom (Hochmah) 
  of Primordial Man. The line then extends downwards again, coiling round to become 
  a third circle within the second. This is known as the circle of Understanding 
  (Binah) of Primordial Man. In this way, the circles are made one within the 
  other, up to the circle number ten, known as the circle of Kingdom (Malkhuth) 
  of Primordial Man. Here is revealed the nature of the ten Sefiroth, which were 
  emanated by way of the ten mystic concentric circles. All this is an aspect 
  of the ten Sefiroth, which automatically includes all aspects of all the worlds; 
  but in fact it is explained--and it is a simple explanation--that many kinds 
  of worlds were emanated, created, formed, and made a million or a billion times 
  over, all being equally in the middle of the empty space already referred to, 
  with Nothing outside it.</p>
<p>And behold, each world has its own ten Sefiroth. And each individual Sefirah 
  in each world is composed of ten distinctly separate Sefiroth. Each one is in 
  the form of a circle, one inside the other, and one after the other, endless 
  and innumerable; one inside the other like the layers of an onion, like a picture 
  of wheels, as mentioned in the book of contents. The author perceived all these 
  circles together, through the aforementioned thin line extending from the Infinite, 
  passing along and descending, extending from circle to circle to the absolute 
  end of them all; and through this line the light and abundance required for 
  each one of them. Here is clearly explained and revealed the nature of the ten 
  circles of the ten Sefiroth.</p>
<p>We now come to explain the second aspect of the ten Sefiroth, namely the Light 
  of Righteousness, in form like three lines in the shape of the Supreme Man. 
  This route then proceeds from the top downwards, where the circles extend. The 
  line extends directly from the top downwards, from the extreme tip of the summit 
  of the highest circle of them all to the very lowest point of the bottom of 
  all the circles. It extends from the top downwards, enclosing the ten Sefiroth 
  in the mystic similitude of the upright man standing upright and comprising 
  248 limbs imagined from the ten Sefiroth, both in totality and each Sefirah 
  separately--of the ten without end in the same form as the ten Sefiroth which 
  are as circles.</p>
<p>This aspect, number two, is termed &quot;the image of Elohim,&quot; and the 
  text refers to it in the words (Torah B'reshith 1:27): &quot;And Elohim created 
  Man in His image, in the image of Elohim,&quot; and almost all of the Sefer 
  HaZohar, and the Tikunim HaZohar are concerned with this second aspect alone, 
  as is indicated elsewhere.</p>
<p>So both explanations are tenable, for there are two aspects, circular and linear, 
  both being equally valid, both the Word of the Living Elohim. In this way there 
  are several dictums which appear to be contradictory and which are settled with 
  reference to the order and position of the ten Sefiroth. This is explained in 
  both these two aspects. In the first, the aspect of the ten Sefiroth in the 
  form of concentric circles, it is quite obvious that the largest of these circles, 
  encompassing all the others, is the wheel of the Crown, which is more closely 
  attached to the Infinite than the others, and is therefore more excellent and 
  laudable.</p>
<p>But the second wheel, known as Wisdom has a space between it and the Infinite, 
  which is the wheel of the Crown, so that its degree of superiority is one less 
  than that of the Crown. Similarly, the wheel of Understanding is double the 
  distance away from the Infinite, that is two wheels away, so in grade it is 
  inferior to Wisdom. Thus, the nearer to the Infinite is the world's circle in 
  space, the more superior it is and the greater its excellence, down to this 
  world, which is in the very center of all the circles, within the void space 
  mentioned above. It is far removed from the Infinite, farther than all other 
  worlds, so that it is so material, so mundane, that it has no peer, being the 
  middle of all those circles. Understand this well.</p>
<p>There is also a second reason, connected with the first. As has been explained, 
  the line extending from the Infinite stretches then to form a circle, expanding 
  further downwards and circling up to the very last of all the circles. And the 
  first circle at the beginning of the line is superior to, and more excellent 
  than all circles below it, as it comes from the top of the line, and furthermore 
  it is illumined, being in the highest place--the highest circle of all, known 
  as &quot;Upward.&quot; The circle next inside is middle and center--the lowest 
  of them, illumined from the bottom of that line, is known as &quot;downward&quot; 
  [Note: see Sefer Yetzirah, Chapter 1].</p>
<p>In Branch III, concerning the ten circles of the world of points, it will be 
  explained how the aspect of the ten Sefiroth of the circles is linear, though 
  circular, apart from the aspect of the ten Sefiroth of Righteousness (Yosher), 
  which is in the form of Man. And there is the end of the circles--there it will 
  be explained how in the ten Sefiroth the circles are justified right, and left, 
  and center, as they are like concentric circles. Also in the second aspect of 
  Righteousness, which is pictured as Man, appear right and correct, upward and 
  down ward, front and back; for it is clear that that which is nearest the beginning 
  of the line should be the head, lower down the body, and still lower the feet; 
  and so on and so forth in great detail. In Branch III will also be explained 
  the nature of the ten circles of Primordial Man. This matter is explained therein: 
  every world is of circular aspect, concentric like the layers of an onion. The 
  first aspect is suggested in the Zohar in a number of places, especially in 
  Parashath Vayiqra, p.9-10, how even heaven and earth are as layers of an onion, 
  one inside the other. Similarly, in Parashoth B'reshith p.19, &quot;All were 
  required by the Holy One, blessed be He, with which to create the world and 
  perfect it--the brain at the center, with layers surrounding it, all worlds 
  likewise, one within the other, so that each one surrounds the next.&quot; (see 
  Figure) Although from there the order seems reversed, so that the most inward 
  was the brain and the next layer was something lesser, if you would but open 
  the eyes of your mind you would understand and see that this article speaks 
  of our ideals, and from the perspective of where we are who live in this low 
  world. And that the nearest to us is the layer surrounding our ideal part, the 
  brain--and within that is the wheel that turns round about it, and beyond that 
  another wheel, that is the brain of another wheel, and so on, so that we find 
  the Infinite is the inmost of all emanations and the central brain of all. All 
  emanated are as layers round this and the wheel nearest to us is the outermost 
  of them all, the other shell or layer. The aspect of the worlds themselves is 
  not so however. The innermost is the outer shell, and surrounding the rest is 
  the brain--but with our eyes what we see first is the outer layer which is the 
  wheel nearest to us. And as it gets farther from us and surrounds all the other 
  wheels, this is known as &quot;internal in our estimation,&quot; and is called 
  &quot;brain,&quot; everything being below it.</p>
<p>In this article, aspect two, which is known as the picture of a man as a &quot;right&quot; 
  creature, will be understood: this embraces a few worlds, as mentioned in the 
  Zohar, Parashath Toledoth p.134. As a person is separated into various layers 
  and all exist, grade upon grade, each improving on the other, and all of one 
  body, so with the world. In Chapter IV, we shall explain how all these aspects 
  make up the diagram of the picture of man, this inside the other, to the end 
  of all the grades. It will be clearly understood there, as they are one inside 
  the other, this being brain and the outer shell. So we see the second aspect 
  in the ten Sefiroth, first the circular aspect and then the aspect of rectitude 
  as the appearance of Man.</p>

<p>9. Work of the Chariot Translations</p>
<p>Revelation of John</p>
<p>A Qabalistic Analysis of the Text</p>
<p>The Revelation of John is an enigmatic, mystically obscure text. It was originally 
  written in Aramaic, though many translations are made from the Greek version. 
  The Revelation of John presents a specialized form of the &quot;Tree of the 
  Treasuries of the House of Elohim.&quot; This Working Path is intended to take 
  true disciples of Master Yeshuvah to the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; in the crown 
  center via seven series of seven experiences alluded to in the forty-nine images 
  presented in the text. This reflects the fact that the Tree has a total of seven 
  Sefiroth which span the four qabalistic worlds, and also that each of those 
  seven Sefirah is itself a complete Tree of seven Sefiroth extending through 
  all four worlds. The forty-nine allusions represent seven repetitions of the 
  seven Sefiroth acting upon one another. To more easily understand this, imagine 
  that each of the seven Sefirah has a test tube containing a differently colored 
  liquid. Then, imagine successively pouring some of the colored liquid from each 
  one into the six others, resulting in a total of forty-nine different colors. 
  Most interpreters of the Revelation see all the action described as occurring 
  in the physical plane. However, the events described in the Revelation occur 
  on multiple planes. Only the allusions involving the Seven Churches exist in 
  the lowest Sefirah Victory, representing the physical plane. The forty-nine 
  allusions in their qabalistic format as a Tree of Life is presented below. </p>
<p>Qabalistic Analysis of the Text</p>
<p>Sefirah One:Victory (Netzach)<br>
  The lowest Sefirah is called Victory. Since this is the lowest Sefirah, it is 
  in the material creation, the waking state of humans. The action of the other 
  Sefiroth upon Sefirah Victory appears as seven &quot;Churches,&quot; with their 
  respective their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In Sefirah Victory--Sefirah: Church, Characteristic<br>
  Blessing: Laodicea, lukewarm<br>
  Thanksgiving: Philadelphia, kept the Word<br>
  Understanding: Sardis, holds fast, dead<br>
  Beauty: Thyatira, works of love<br>
  Mercy: Pergamos, uphold the Name<br>
  Power: Smyrna, crown of life<br>
  Victory: Ephesus, first love</p>
<p>Sefirah Two: Strength (Geburah)<br>
  The second Sefirah is called Strength or Power. The experience in this Sefirah 
  is in the dream state of ordinary humans. The action of the other Sefiroth on 
  Power is given as &quot;Seals,&quot; as follows:</p>
<p>In Sefirah Power--Sefirah: Seal, Characteristic<br>
  Blessing: Seal 7, Silence<br>
  Thanksgiving: Seal 6, Earthquake, Sun, Moon, Stars<br>
  Understanding: Seal 5, Souls of Lamb under Altar<br>
  Beauty: Seal 4, Pale Horse, Death, Hell<br>
  Mercy: Seal 3, Black Horse, balances<br>
  Power: Seal 2, Red Horse, War, Sword<br>
  Victory: Seal 1, White Horse, Bow, Crown</p>
<p>Sefirah Three: Mercy (Gedulah)<br>
  The third Sefirah is called Mercy. The experience in this Sefirah, which is 
  the navel region, is the dream state of humans. The action of the other Sefiroth 
  on Mercy is given as the action of &quot;Angels with Seven Trumpets,&quot; which 
  sound as follows:</p>
<p>In Sefirah Mercy--Sefirah: Angel with Trumpet, Characteristic<br>
  Blessing: Angel 7, Temple of Elohim opened in Heaven; Woman clothed with Sun; 
  Dragon and his seed; War in Heaven, Michael Casts Dragon down to Earth; Dragon 
  fights with Woman (loses); beast arises.<br>
  Thanksgiving: Angel 6, Voice from horns of Golden Altar; 4 Angels of Euphrates 
  <br>
  Understanding: Angel 5, Star from Heaven (opens pit); Pit opens, locusts of 
  Abaddon.<br>
  Beauty: Angel 4, Eagle with blood red tail; one third of sun, darkened.<br>
  Mercy: Angel 3, Star, Wormwood, turns rivers.<br>
  Power: Angel 2, Flaming mountain into Sea; one third sea destroyed.<br>
  Victory: Angel 1, Hail and Fire, one third Earth burnt.</p>
<p>Sefirah Four: Thanksgiving (Todah)<br>
  The fourth Sefirah is called Thanksgiving. The experience in this Sefirah, which 
  is in the heart region, is beyond the usual experiences of humans. The action 
  of the other Sefiroth on Thanksgiving is given as action of the &quot;Angels 
  of the End,&quot; as follows: </p>
<p>In Sefirah Beauty--Sefirah: Angel of the End, Characteristic<br>
  Blessing: Angel 7, &quot;Faithful and True&quot; on White Horse (Messiah as 
  Acharit, The Last); Armageddon won.<br>
  Thanksgiving: Angel 6, Voice from Throne &quot;Praise our Elohim.&quot;<br>
  Understanding: Angel 5, Great Voice of Multitude, AlleluYH<br>
  Beauty: Angel 4, Millstone, overthrow of Babylon<br>
  Mercy: Angel 3, Voice from Heaven: &quot;Come out of Babylon.&quot;<br>
  Power: Angel 2, Judgment on Babylon<br>
  Victory: Angel 1, Showing Babylon</p>
<p>Sefirah Five: Understanding (Binah)<br>
  The fifth Sefirah is called Understanding. The experience in this Sefirah, which 
  is in the throat region, is also beyond the usual experiences of humans, appearing 
  as deep sleep to most of them. The action of the other Sefiroth on Understanding 
  is given as action of the &quot;Angels of the Seven Last Plagues,&quot; as follows:</p>
<p>In Sefirah Understanding--Sefirah: Angel of the Plague, Characteristic<br>
  Blessing: Angel 7, &quot;It is done.&quot; Armageddon starts.<br>
  Thanksgiving: Angel 6, Euphrates dried up<br>
  Understanding: Angel 5, Darkening of Kingdom of Beast.<br>
  Beauty: Angel 4, Sun to scorch Earth.<br>

<p align="center">SHUO KUA </p>
<p align="center">EIGHTH WING OF THE I CHING</p>
<p align="center">CHINESE &quot;BOOK OF CHANGE&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Introduction <br>
  It is interesting to compare the Book of Formation (Sefer Yetzirah) with various 
  aspects of the eighth and oldest wing of the Chinese Book of Change (I Ching), 
  called the Shuo Qua. For instance, one can superimpose the circular version 
  of the flat Tree of Life diagram from the Book of Formation (see Figure) directly 
  over the &quot;Before-the-World Sequence&quot; produced from verses of the Shuo 
  Kua (see Figure). In the Book of Formation, the Sefiroth are created in pairs. 
  The phrase &quot;balancing of weight&quot; in the first verse of the Book of 
  THAT Which is Concealed (Sifra Detzniyutha) alludes this to. In the Shuo Kua, 
  the three-lined Trigrams are also created in pairs. Earlier, we identified the 
  three columns of the flat, vertical version of the qabalistic Tree, with a middle 
  column balancing two polarized side columns. One could similarly identify three 
  columns in the Shuo Qua Tree. In the Book of Formation, the Central Column manifests 
  between the Sefiroth Above or Height and Below or Abyss. In the Before-the-World 
  Sequence, the same Central Column manifests between the Trigrams Heaven and 
  Earth. The polarized side columns on the qabalistic Tree are referred to as 
  &quot;male&quot; (right) and &quot;female&quot; (left), and reflect a descent 
  from the supernal World of Emanation (Atziluth) to the material creation of 
  the World of Making (Asiyah). In the Shuo Qua Tree, the two side columns are 
  likewise polarized, reflecting the separation and changing differentiation of 
  the pre-celestial yang (right) and yin (left) in the descent from the most yang 
  condition of Vast Face in Trigram Heaven to the most yin condition of Small 
  Face in Trigram Earth.</p>
<p>The Trigrams explicated in the Shuo Kua are eight permutations of yang (Vast 
  Face) and yin (Small Face) lines in sets of three. In the I Ching, the Trigrams 
  are variously combined to produce sixty-four different sets of six lines, called 
  Hexagrams. The Trigrams can also be correlated respectively with six of the 
  Hebrew Double Letters plus the two Mother Letters Mem (Water) and Shin (Fire). 
  Each of the Hexagrams can thus be correlated to a combination of two of the 
  eight Hebrew letters. </p>
<p>In the I Ching, the Fallen Tree finds its counterpart in the &quot;After-the-World 
  Sequence&quot; (see Figure). The After-the-World Sequence is of particular significance 
  to Taoist internal alchemy. In this context, the Taoist Tree alludes to a transformation 
  of consciousness. The qabalistic Tree becomes a Fallen Tree when the Sefirah 
  Knowledge/First in the throat center ostensibly &quot;falls&quot; and becomes 
  the Sefirah Kingdom in the anal center. The qabalistic Tree once again becomes 
  a Tree of Perfection in human consciousness when Kingdom returns to its original 
  position in Knowledge/First and the entire Creation is seen as a Unity in Small 
  Face in the Mind of Vast Face. In the Taoist Tree, when the world manifests, 
  the Trigrams rotate and assume different positions, with Fire moving into the 
  position formerly occupied by Heaven, and Water moving into the position formerly 
  occupied by Earth.</p>
<p>Translation of the Shuo Kua</p>
<p>&quot;DISCUSSION OF THE TRIGRAMS&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter One<br>
  Section One<br>
  In ancient times the holy sages made the Book of Change thus:<br>
  - They invented the yarrow-stalk oracle in order to lend aid in a mysterious 
  way to the light of the Gods. To heaven they assigned the number three and to 
  Earth the number two; from these they computed the other numbers.<br>
  - They contemplated the changes in the dark and the light and established the 
  hexagrams in accordance with them. They brought about movements in the firm 
  and the yielding, and thus produced the individual lines.<br>
  - They put themselves in accord with Tao and its power, and in conformity with 
  this laid down the order of what is right. By thinking through the order of 
  the outer world to the end, and by exploring the law of their nature to the 
  deepest core, they arrived at an understanding of fate.</p>
<p>Section Two<br>
  In ancient times the holy sages made the Book of Changes thus:<br>
  - Their purpose was to follow the order of their nature and of fate. <br>
  - Therefore they determined the Tao of heaven and called it the dark and the 
  light.<br>
  - They determined the Tao of the Earth and called it the yielding and the firm.<br>
  - They determined the Tao of Man and called it love and rectitude.<br>
  - They combined these three fundamental powers and doubled them;<br>
  therefore in the Book of Change, six lines always form a sign. <br>
  The places are divided into the dark and the light. <br>
  The yielding and the firm occupy these by turns. <br>
  Therefore the Book of Change has six places, <br>
  which constitute the linear figures.</p>
<p>Chapter Two<br>
  Section Three<br>
  Heaven and Earth determine the direction<br>
  The forces of mountain and lake are united.<br>
  Thunder and wind arouse each other.<br>
  Water and fire do not combat each other.<br>
  Thus are the eight Trigrams intermingled.<br>
  Counting that which is going into the past depends on the forward movement.<br>
  Knowing that which is to come depends on the backward movement.<br>
  This is why the Book of Change has backward-moving numbers.</p>
<p>Section Four<br>
  God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing,<br>
  He brings all things to completion in the sign of the Gentle:<br>
  He causes creatures to perceive one another in the sign of the Clinging;<br>
  He causes them to serve one another in the sign of the Receptive;<br>
  He gives them joy in the sign of the Joyous;<br>
  He battles in the sign of the Creative;<br>
  He toils in the sign of the Abysmal;<br>
  He brings them to perfection in the sign of Keeping Still.</p>
<p>All living things come forth in the sign of the Arousing.<br>
  The Arousing stands in the east.<br>
  They come to completion in the sign of the Gentle. <br>
  The Gentle stands in the southeast. <br>
  Completion means that all creatures become pure and perfect.<br>
  The Clinging is the brightness in which all creatures perceive one another. 
  It is the Trigram of the south. That the holy sages turned their faces to the 
  south while they gave ear to the meaning of the universe means that in ruling 
  they turned toward what is light. This they evidently took from this Trigram.<br>
  The Receptive means the Earth. It takes care that all creatures are nourished.<br>
  Therefore it is said: &quot;He causes them to serve one another in the sign 
  of the Receptive.&quot;<br>
  The Joyous is mid autumn, which rejoices all creatures. <br>
  Therefore it is said: &quot;He gives them joy in the sign of the Joyous.&quot;<br>
  He battles in the sign of the Creative.<br>
  The Creative is the Trigram of toil, to which all creatures are subject. <br>
  Therefore it is said; &quot;He toils in the sign of the Abysmal.&quot;<br>
  Keeping Still is the Trigram of the northeast,<br>
  where beginning and end of all creatures are completed.<br>
  Therefore it is said: &quot;He brings them to perfection in the sign of Keeping 
  Still.&quot;</p>
<p>Section Six<br>
  The spirit is mysterious in all living things and works through them.<br>
  Of all the forces that move things, there is none swifter than Thunder.<br>
  Of all the forces that bend things, there is none swifter than the Wind.<br>
  Of all forces that warm things, there is none more drying than Fire.<br>
  Of all forces that give joy to things, there is none more gladdening than the 
  Lake.<br>
  Of all the forces that moisten things, there is none moister than Water.<br>
  Of all the forces that end and begin things, there is none <br>
  more glorious than Keeping Still.</p>
<p>Therefore: Water and fire complement each other,<br>
  Thunder and Wind do not interfere with each other,<br>
  and the forces of Mountain and Lake are united in their action.<br>
  Thus only are change and transformation possible, and thus only<br>
  can all things come to perfection.</p>
<p>Chapter Three<br>
  Section Seven<br>
  The Creative is strong.<br>
  The Receptive is yielding.<br>
  The Arousing means movement.<br>
  The Gentle is penetrating.<br>
  The Abysmal is dangerous.<br>
  The Clinging means dependence.<br>
  Keeping Still means standstill.<br>
  The Joyous means pleasure.</p>
<p>Section Eight<br>
  The Creative acts in the horse,<br>
  the Receptive in the cow,<br>
  the Arousing in the dragon,<br>
  the Gentle in the cock,<br>
  the Abysmal in the pig,<br>
  the Clinging in the pheasant,<br>
  Keeping Still in the dog,<br>
  the Joyous in the sheep.</p>
<p>Section Nine<br>
  The Creative manifests itself in the head,<br>
  the Receptive in the belly,<br>
  the Arousing in the foot,<br>
  the Gentle in the thighs,<br>
  the Abysmal in the ear,<br>
  the Clinging in the eye,<br>
  Keeping Still in the hand,<br>
  the Joyous in the mouth.</p>
<p>Section Ten<br>
  The Creative is heaven, therefore, it is called the father.<br>
  The Receptive is the earth, therefore, it is called the mother.<br>
  In the Trigram of the Arousing, she seeks for the first time the power of the 
  male and receives a son. Therefore, the Arousing is called the Eldest Son.<br>
  In the Trigram of the Gentle the male seeks for the first time the power of 
  the female and receives a daughter. Therefore, the Gentle is called the Eldest 
  Daughter.<br>
  In the Trigram of the Abysmal she seeks for a second time and receives a son. 
  Therefore, it is called the Middle Son.<br>
  In the Trigram of the Clinging he seeks for a second time and receives a daughter. 
  Therefore, it is called the Middle Daughter.<br>
  In the Trigram of Keeping Still she seeks for a third time and receives a son. 
  Therefore, it is called the Youngest Son.<br>
  In the Trigram of the Joyous he seeks for a third time and receives a daughter. 
  Therefore, it is called the Third Daughter.</p>
