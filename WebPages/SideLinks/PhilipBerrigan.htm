  79</font> <br>
  Josephite Father Called Protests 'Prophetic Acts' </p>
<p align="center">By Jacques Kelly and Carl Schoettler <br>
  Sun Staff </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Saturday, 7 December, 2002 </p>
  <p>Philip Berrigan, the patriarch of the Roman Catholic anti-war movement whose 
    conscience collided with national policy for more than three decades, died 
    last night of liver and kidney cancer. He was 79 and had lived at Jonah House 
    on the grounds of a West Baltimore cemetery for much of the past decade. </p>
  <p>He led the Catonsville Nine, who staged one of the most dramatic protests 
    of the 1960s. They doused homemade napalm on a small bonfire of draft records 
    in a Catonsville parking lot and ignited a generation of anti-war dissent. 
    More recently he helped found the Plowshares movement, whose members have 
    attacked federal military property in anti-war and anti-nuclear protests and 
    were then often imprisoned. </p>
  <p>Mr. Berrigan died at 9:30 p.m. at the Jonah House, a communal living facility 
    of war resisters. </p>
  <p>In a final statement released by his family, he said, &quot;I die with the 
    conviction, held since 1968 and Catonsville, that nuclear weapons are the 
    scourge of the earth; to mine for them, manufacture them, deploy them, use 
    them, is a curse against God, the human family, and the earth itself.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>Though Mr. Berrigan was an Army veteran - he was a second lieutenant in the 
    infantry - who fought across Western Europe in World War II, he persistently 
    and publicly criticized the Vietnam War and U.S. foreign and domestic policy. 
    He first gained national attention during part of the 14-year period during 
    which he wore the Roman collar and clerical garb of a Josephite priest. </p>
  <p>He eventually served some 11 years in jail and prison for his actions challenging 
    public authority and repeated bashing of the military budget. </p>
  <p>Howard Zinn, professor emeritus at Boston University who maintained a friendship 
    with Mr. Berrigan through the years because they had similar views, called 
    him &quot;one of the great Americans of our time.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;He believed war didn't solve anything,&quot; Mr. Zinn said. &quot;He 
    went to prison again and again and again for his beliefs. I admired him for 
    the sacrifices he made. He was an inspiration to a large number of people.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>Mr. Berrigan saw his protests as &quot;prophetic acts&quot; based on the 
    Biblical injunction to beat swords into plowshares, and that included the 
    &quot;symbolic&quot; destruction of Selective Service records in raids on 
    draft board offices in the Baltimore Customs House in 1967 and in Catonsville 
    in 1968. He was also convicted of smuggling letters in and out of the federal 
    penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa., while an inmate there in 1970, though the 
    conviction was later thrown out. The end of the Vietnam War failed to silence 
    him; he continued his missions of dissent until the end of his life. </p>
  <p>In his most recent clash in December 1999, Mr. Berrigan and others banged 
    on A-10 Warthog warplanes in an anti-war protest at the Middle River Air National 
    Guard base. He was convicted of malicious destruction of property and sentenced 
    to 30 months. He was released Dec. 14 last year. </p>
  <p>Mr. Berrigan's brother Daniel, a Jesuit priest and poet who participated 
    in the 1968 Catonsville protest, later wrote the play The Trial of the Catonsville 
    Nine, which ran on Broadway for 29 performances in 1971 and was made into 
    a movie a year later. It recounted verbatim episodes from the trial and the 
    moral dilemmas of the Vietnam War era. </p>
  <p>&quot;We confront the Catholic Church, other Christian bodies and the synagogues 
    of America with their silence and cowardice in the face of our country's crimes,&quot; 
    said a statement Philip Berrigan and his eight fellow protestors issued that 
    day in Catonsville. &quot;We are convinced that the religious bureaucracy 
    in this country is racist, is an accomplice in this war and is hostile to 
    the poor.&quot; </p>
  <p>He expanded those views to include opposition to almost any form of established 
    government that would wage war, deploy nuclear weapons or even use nuclear 
    power. Neither he nor any member of the Jonah House community had voted for 
    years because of their dismissal of government. </p>
  <p>&quot;We don't know whether we're qualified to vote because we're all felons,&quot; 
    he said recently. &quot;But we intend to pursue it for the elections in 2004 
    because it's pretty important to get Bush out of there.&quot; </p>
  <p>Philip Francis Berrigan was born Oct. 5, 1923, in Two Harbors, Minn., then 
    a thriving mining town on the Mesabi Iron Range. </p>
  <p>According to a 1976 Current Biography profile, Mr. Berrigan stressed the 
    influence of his father, Thomas, a trade unionist turned Socialist who lost 
    his job as a railroad engineer. Mr. Berrigan later characterized his father 
    as a &quot;tyrannical&quot; man. He said he father's treatment left him apt 
    to &quot;bristle against authority.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Our mother (Frida) was a mild woman, dedicated to her six sons and 
    to her religion,&quot; said his brother, Jim Berrigan, a retired electrical 
    engineer who lives in Salisbury. </p>
  <p>After graduating from high school in Syracuse, N.Y., Mr. Berrigan cleaned 
    New York Central Railroad locomotives. A good athlete, he was a first baseman 
    who played with a local semi-professional team. He also enjoyed golf and basketball 
    in college. </p>
  <p>He spent one semester at St. Michael's College in Toronto before being drafted 
    into the U.S. Army in January 1943 for service in World War II. He was an 
    artillery man in some of the fiercest action from Normandy to the Battle of 
    the Bulge, where he was chosen to go to infantry school near Paris. He served 
    out the rest of the war as an infantry officer, a second lieutenant. </p>
  <p>He earned an English degree at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. 
    In 1950, he followed his brother Jerome into the Society of St. Joseph. The 
    order, known as the Josephite Fathers, serves African-American communities. 
  </p>
  <p>Ordained in 1955, he was assigned to New Orleans, where he earned a degree 
    in secondary education at Loyola University of the South in 1957 and a master's 
    at Xavier University three years later. </p>
  <p>While at Xavier, he began teaching English and religion and counseling students 
    at his order's St. Augustine High School. </p>
  <p>&quot;From the beginning, he stood with the urban poor,&quot; Daniel Berrigan 
    wrote of his brother's years in the priesthood. &quot;He rejected the traditional, 
    isolated stance of the Church in black communities. He was also incurably 
    secular; he saw the Church as one resource, bringing to bear on the squalid 
    facts of racism the light of the Gospel, the presence of inventive courage 
    and hope. He worked with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], SNCC [Student 
    Non-Violent Coordinating Committee], the Urban League, the forms of Catholic 
    action then in vogue. He took Freedom Rides, did manual work of all kinds, 
    begged money and gave it away, struggled for scholarships for black students.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>Philip Berrigan, in a recent Sun interview, said his first arrest of many 
    came in 1962 or 1963 during a civil rights protest in Selma, Ala., at which 
    point his name began appearing in newspapers. He would become quite adept 
    at surviving in prison. He got along with the other prisoners, even murderers 
    sometimes, and they accepted him. He led Bible study classes and helped prisoners 
    with educational and legal matters. If he had extra money, he would buy items 
    from the prison commissaries for down-and-out inmates. </p>
  <p>As an activist priest, Father Berrigan soon got in trouble with his church 
    superiors. He was transferred to the faculty of Epiphany Apostolic College, 
    a Josephite seminary in Newburgh, N.Y., where he again led protests on behalf 
    of the poor. </p>
  <p>Rosalie Bertell, 73, of Buffalo, N.Y., an activist and member of the order 
    of the Grey Nuns of the Sacred Heart, said she admired Mr. Berrigan for his 
    &quot;blunt honesty&quot; and for the &quot;choices he made in life.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>A longtime friend of the Berrigan family, Ms. Bertell is an internationally 
    recognized expert on radiation and testified as an expert witness in trials 
    where he was arrested for anti-nuclear demonstrations. &quot;He knew the U.S. 
    was becoming a killing machine, and he was willing to go to jail trying to 
    stop it.&quot; </p>
  <p>As the United States expanded its presence in Vietnam, Father Berrigan became 
    more outspoken and visible. In 1964, he organized the Emergency Citizens Group 
    Concerned About Vietnam in Newburgh and co-founded the Catholic Peace Fellowship 
    in New York City. </p>
  <p>Frustrated by the church's failure to speak out against the war, he compared 
    its stance on Vietnam to &quot;the German Church under Hitler.&quot; </p>
  <p>In another speech, he asked, &quot;Is it possible for us to be vicious, brutal, 
    immoral, and violent at home and be fair, judicious, beneficent and idealistic 
    abroad?&quot; </p>
  <p>Not long afterward, Father Berrigan's Josephite superiors transferred him 
    again, this time to St. Peter Claver Church in West Baltimore. </p>
  <p>&quot;He was an excellent curate, much respected in the community back in 
    the 1960s,&quot; said the Rev. Michael Roach, a former Southwest Baltimore 
    pastor who is now at St. Bartholomew's Church in Manchester. </p>
  <p>While at St. Peter Claver, Father Berrigan started the Baltimore Interfaith 
    Peace Mission. He made frequent trips to Washington to lobby Congress and 
    federal officials and lead vigils and other peace demonstrations. </p>
  <p>On Oct. 27, 1967, Father Berrigan and three others dumped blood on Selective 
    Service records in the Baltimore Customs House, &quot;anointing&quot; them, 
    he said. They waited to be arrested, as they would in subsequent protests. 
    His arrest shocked the Catholic Church. </p>
  <p>In a statement to reporters, the Baltimore Four said that &quot;this sacrificial 
    and constructive act&quot; was meant to protest &quot;the pitiful waste of 
    American and Vietnamese blood&quot; in Indochina. </p>
  <p>It was a new kind of protest. The Baltimore chancery said the action was 
    likely to &quot;alienate a great number of sincere men in the cause of a just 
    peace.&quot; </p>
  <p>Philip Berrigan and the three others were charged and convicted of defacing 
    government property and impeding the Selective Service. While awaiting sentencing, 
    Mr. Berrigan began recruiting brother Daniel and seven others for a second 
    &quot;prophetic act.&quot; </p>
  <p>The Catonsville Nine chose Selective Service Board 33, housed in a Knights 
    of Columbus hall on Frederick Road in Catonsville. </p>
  <p>According to a Sun account, the nine walked into the draft board office on 
    May 17, 1968, moved and swept aside stunned clerks and emptied filing cabinets 
    of 600 draft records. </p>
  <p>They set the records afire with homemade napalm in the parking lot, said 
    a prayer and waited for arrest. They spent the night in the Baltimore County 
    Jail in Towson. </p>
  <p>Charged with conspiracy and destruction of government property, Mr. Berrigan 
    and his companions were found guilty in U.S. District Court in Baltimore on 
    Nov. 8, 1968. They were free on bail for 16 months until the U.S. Supreme 
    Court declined to reconsider the verdict. </p>
  <p>But on the day they were supposed to begin serving their sentences, the Berrigan 
    brothers and two others went into hiding. Twelve days later, FBI found Philip 
    Berrigan at the Church of St. Gregory the Great in Manhattan, and he was taken 
    to the federal prison in Lewisburg. </p>
  <p>Mr. Berrigan and Elizabeth McAlister, a former nun, a member of the Religious 
    of the Sacred Heart of Mary, had secretly married a year earlier, in, as they 
    put it, &quot;trust and gratitude.&quot; The marriage was not disclosed until 
    1973, when there was a ceremony at which a former monk officiated. </p>
  <p>A fellow inmate at Lewisburg, who was allowed to take courses at a local 
    college, carried messages between Mr. Berrigan and his wife. </p>
  <p>Ms. McAlister kept Mr. Berrigan informed of what was being done and said 
    in the peace movement. They were unaware that the inmate carrying their messages 
    was a paid informer and that copies of everything they wrote were going to 
    the FBI. </p>
  <p>The FBI's scrutiny led to the capture of Daniel Berrigan, to the arrest of 
    draft resisters in Rochester, N.Y., and to the indictment of Philip Berrigan, 
    Ms. McAlister and five others. </p>
  <p>The government indicted the Harrisburg Seven on 23 counts of conspiracy, 
    including plots to kidnap presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger and to blow 
    up heating tunnels in Washington. Defense lawyers, including Paul O'Dwyer, 
    Ramsey Clark and Leonard Boudin, saw the conspiracy indictments as a &quot;gross 
    caricature,&quot; and the charges were later modified. </p>
  <p>In April 1972, a jury in Harrisburg, Pa., found Mr. Berrigan and his wife 
    guilty on the letter-smuggling charges but deadlocked on all the other counts. 
    A mistrial was declared. Everything was later thrown out by a federal appeals 
    court. </p>
  <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Garry Wills, who lived in Baltimore from 1961 
    to 1980, said he participated in the anti-war demonstrations with the Berrigans. 
  </p>
  <p>&quot;I've known them for decades and I've written about them, and Phil has 
    always been an inspiration to me,&quot; Mr. Wills said. &quot;Phil was a real 
    pacifist. He always turned the other cheek.&quot; </p>
  <p>Mr. Berrigan and Ms. McAlister helped start the anti-war and anti-nuclear 
    Plowshares movement in the three-story Reservoir Hill rowhouse on Park Avenue 
    they called Jonah House, in which they lived in community with other activists 
    for years before moving into the old St. Peter the Apostle Cemetery in West 
    Baltimore. </p>
  <p>Mr. Berrigan was the author of several books, including No More Strangers, 
    Punishment for Peace, Prison Journals of a Priest Revolutionary and Widen 
    the Prison Gates. In 1996, he wrote his autobiography, Fighting the Lamb's 
    War, and with his wife wrote The Times' Discipline, a work on their life together 
    at Jonah House. </p>
  <p>Survivors include Ms. McAlister; two daughters, Frida, a prolific writer 
    who is a research associate at the World Policy Institute and a member of 
    the War Resister's League executive committee, of New York, and Kate Berrigan, 
    a senior at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio; a son, Jerry Berrigan, a member 
    of the Catholic Worker who is also involved in anti-war, anti-nuclear and 
    anti-death penalty movements, of Luck, Mich.; four brothers, the Rev. Daniel 
    Berrigan, a Jesuit priest in New York, John Berrigan of Prescott, Ariz., Jim 
    Berrigan of Salisbury and Jerome Berrigan of Syracuse, N.Y. </p>

<p><font size="+1">It was the Christmas season on Long Island, sometime during 
  the late 1960s, or very early 70s. The three of us, my mother, my wife, Nan, 
  and myself, pulled into the enormous parking lot of the Smithhaven Mall. The 
  place was packed. My habit was to stay in the car and read while the <i>ladys</i> 
  went shopping, but the night was frigid cold. I decided to go inside, and find 
  a place to sit among the santa clauses, the bright colored lights, the music 
  and the candy canes, and spend the time studying the faces of people as they 
  passed by instead. (Nan often had to scold me for not realizing that I was actually 
  staring at people, wondering who they were, what they were thinking. The human 
  face, of course, is a reflection of the Face of God, and the human mind a reflection 
  of the Mind of God). I never made it inside of the mall that evening. As we 
  approached the main entrance there was a line of people standing outside in 
  the dark, in the cold, holding candles. There was a war raging in Vietnam, and 
  these people from The Woman's International League for Peace and Justice were 
  there to remind those of us who might have been unaware, or who had grown complacent 
  about it all, that as we shopped others were dying, bombs were raining down 
  on cities and villages, children were being burned to death, and that it was 
  all happening in the name of the American people themselves. Can I have one 
  of your candles? I asked. And may I stand here with you? </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Nan and I had given up a ten-year career in the military service, 
  for reasons we were not fully aware of until later, when we came to realize 
  that there was actually an antiwar movement happening in America, and that we 
  were not alone in our sentiments. It was the antiwar movement that rounded out 
  and helped solidify our understanding of the path we were on. I was on my way 
  to Vietnam in 1967, aboard an American aircraft carrier. We were very naive, 
  <i>protected from reality </i>is a better way to describe it, as almost all 
  American service men and women are. We were in the sheltering embrace of the 
  American military establishment, and literally unaware of the civil rights and 
  antiwar movements that were happening in the country at the time. Well, Nan 
  was already singing Dylan songs around the house, I had no idea who he was. 
  What we did sense together, however, in a very inarticulate way, was that I 
  had no business in Vietnam, fighting a war halfway around the globe, for reasons 
  that I did not understand, against a people that I had nothing against. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We were beginning to awaken spiritually--a process that would 
  take some time--and had already read where it said that a person could not serve 
  two masters. One could not serve God and men at the same time (and especially 
  the God of Peace and men of war at the same time). Our's was a private journey 
  back to God, and to the Bible, which we also knew very little of at the time 
  (Catholics you know). Our understanding of things was quite imperfect. Nan, 
  nevertheless, was already a pacifist at heart, and was in full agreement as 
  we took our first step, left the military, packed up our belongings and our 
  children in the back of a little station wagon, and headed out across the country 
  for civilian life. It was a big transition, and the most immediate work I could 
  find that matched my skills was with the Grumman Aviation Corporation. We were 
  thankful for the job, and as I look back on it, it provided us a first hand 
  look into the corporate side of the giant military-industrial complex. I was 
  working there when we first met the people who, unknowingly, would become our 
  mentors for the next few years or so. It takes a while to sort through all of 
  these things and to finally and completely make the right choices. We were on 
  a rapid learning curve, however, and soon understood the implications of the 
  work I was still doing in support of America's war efforts. Woodstock, Kent 
  State, Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy, Black activism and the American Indian 
  Movement, it was a dynamic time in America. We dove in, took another leap of 
  faith and quit the job. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One night Sister Elizabeth McAlister was to speak at a local 
  coffee house, to explain from the religious perspective what was going on in 
  the country and with her fellowship of resisters and antiwar activists, all 
  of whom were appearing in the headlines of late. We even persuaded my father, 
  one of this country's <i>greatest generation, </i>to accompany us. Arriving, 
  we discovered that Sister McAlister could not make it that evening but had sent 
  a Jesuit priest, Ned Murphy, to speak on her behalf. Afterwards we offered to 
  take Ned Murphy back to his community house in New York City, to learn more 
  of what was happening from the spiritual (or rather, religious) point of view, 
  but not before my father added a $50 bill to the hat that went around, and all 
  of us wound up in the basement kitchen of the Cenacle Retreat House--drinking 
  beer with priests and nuns! My world was changing faster than I could imagine.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A cousin of mine told us about the antiwar demonstration that 
  was to take place in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in connection with the trial 
  unfolding there, and the charges that were being weighed against Philip Berrigan, 
  Elizabeth McAlister and others. He told us to meet him and his friends at the 
  Augsburg Lutheran Church where they would be staying for the night. Our oldest 
  daughter, Sharon, and myself got there late on the night before the demonstration, 
  and found the church. There was little light inside as we stepped around sleeping 
  bodies whispering &quot;Pat Ryan, Pat Ryan, are you here?&quot; Someone from 
  the other side of the sanctuary hollered out, &quot;He got ill, and went back 
  to New York City.&quot; So there we were, on our own, at our first real demonstration 
  against America's military machine. We witnessed a loaf of bread being broken 
  in a thousand pieces and being shared by all at a song and prayer service the 
  following evening. That was a mystical experience. It was very ironic, however. 
  I went from a life in the military to the antiwar movement. Pat went from the 
  antiwar movement into the military. He joined soon afterwards and rose to the 
  rank of Lieutenant Commander in the American Intelligence Service. (He is retired 
  now, thank God, but still believes in the mission of America's armed forces. 
  There is a Theology of Armed Might and Pat became a believer. It is a replication 
  of the cult of <i>Sol Invictus</i> that was observed by the Roman legions, which 
  took on the patterns of Christian worship after the <i>church</i> gave itself 
  over to the political order in the time of Constantine. This is what happens 
  when the Law and the Prophets are forsaken, and men go backwards and listen 
  to men [recruiters in this case] rather than the Spirit. Yet all things are 
  all happening in their proper way, even if we can not understand it. My own 
  seven-year old granddaughter, expressing the things she has been learning at 
  her grade school, said, &quot;Grandpa, did you ever think that the army is what 
  makes us free?&quot; Her teachers told her that. &quot;My dearest one, it is 
  Jesus who makes us free, and Jesus commanded us to stay out of the army and 
  away from war&quot;)</font><font size="+1">. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was early in 1974 when Sharon came home from school one 
  afternoon with <i>the Idea</i>. &quot;Let's give away, or sell everything we 
  own, and get in the car and go wherever God will take us,&quot; she said. Nan 
  and I looked at each other, looked at her, at each other again, and said &quot;okay!&quot; 
  Within a month or so the house was sold, a teaching position at a local high 
  school left behind, friends and family embraced, and we were in the station 
  wagon heading out for only God knew where. By April we discovered ourselves 
  in a back-to-the-land counter-cultural community in West Virginia. It was the 
  next stage of our own journey to social and spiritual awareness, and to the 
  beginning of this labor of love as it is, this Commentary on the Tree of Life. 
  (Some of our children and grandchildren are still laboring and struggling with 
  the effects of it all--with this journey out of the mainstream of American life 
  into the conditions of rural <i>poverty </i> to which we gave ourselves. The 
  spiritual rewards and simple blessings return however, one by one). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Work was scarce that following winter so several of us went 
  over to Baltimore to find employment until springtime. Nan and our friend Lorrie 
  found work at a Howard Johnson restaurant and I was hired on as a welder at 
  the Sparrow's Point Shipyard. As webs are woven in life, we heard at that time 
  that Ned Murphy was staying at Jonah House on Park Avenue. Calling over to say 
  hello, I was invited to visit. It was there that I met Philip Berrigan and Elizabeth 
  McAlister, and must admit that I was a little starry-eyed to be there. It was 
  like coming up to the big leagues, if only for a game or two. I remember Elizabeth 
  saying that they had been accused of being unrealistic, of not having any real 
  connections to the <i>real world</i>, where real people were raising families 
  and had to actually work for a living. She said in a light-hearted way that 
  I could be their connection to the working class. It would be a meager voice, 
  I said. I suggested that someone should publish a book of names of people in 
  the antiwar movement, like the one the Rainbow Gathering now distributes each 
  year, so that people traveling from place to place could be in touch with each 
  other. I think they were a little suspicious of that suggestion. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I took part in two actions at the White House that spring. 
  Ford was president, and the issue now was amnesty for draft resisters and those 
  who fled to Canada and other countries. Twice we were arrested (an act which 
  had become almost ritual by then). For the first offense we received a suspended 
  sentence of one year in a federal prison, and for the second offense, a suspended 
  sentence of two years--with a warning that if any of us returned to that court 
  again for the same offenses that we <i>would</i> do the time. At the same time, 
  however, there was a growing awareness. I went to the steps of the east wing 
  of the White House, where we were arrested the first time, to recite from the 
  book of Isaiah, to express those words of the ancient prophets that were clearly 
  applicable to our times--at least to me they were. I was not a fundamentalist 
  by any means yet it seemed natural to consider God, and to include God in the 
  very events that They themselves were clearly bringing to pass. </font><font size="+1">(It 
  is true, I was developing some very apocalyptic tendencies, for which, we soon 
  learned, there was not much tolerance or acceptance in the antiwar community)...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As reflected in the Qumran 
    literature, these apocalyptists saw world history in terms of warring forces, 
    God and Satan, the spirits of truth and error, light and darkness. The struggle 
    of God with man and the struggle of man with sin, evil, and death were objectified 
    into a cosmic struggle. Dualistic themes from archaic myths were transformed 
    into historical myths. The world, captive to evil powers and principalities 
    that had been given authority in the era of divine wrath, could be freed only 
    by the Divine Might. These apocalyptisits saw...the dawning of God's day of 
    salvation and judgment. The old age had come to the end of its allotted time, 
    and the <i>(time)</i> of consumation was at hand, the <i>(time) </i>when the 
    world would be redeemed and the elect vindicated. The apocalyptist saw the 
    signals of the approaching of the end of days. For them, the final war, Armageddon, 
    had begun. The Messiah was about to appear &quot;bringing the Sword.&quot; 
    The Satanic forces, brought to bay, had already lashed out in a final defiant 
    convulsion, manifested in the persecution, temptations, and tribulations of 
    the faithful. In short, the apocalyptist lived in a world in which the sovereignty 
    of God was the sole hope of salvation; in the earnestness of his faith and 
    the vividness of his hope, he was certain that God was about to act.&quot;

<p><font size="+1"> But did it matter? as long as the main political objectives 
  were achieved? Well it did matter, and it still does, because all of this was 
  bigger than mere politics. Something divine was unfolding in the earth, and 
  people were not grasping it. And it mattered because America did not become 
  a more peaceful nation as a result of all those activities. It became more violent, 
  more militaristic, and more subtle as it assimilated the language, and adapted 
  the values of the 60s to its own continuing political, economic and military 
  agenda. Sitting in the living room at Jonah House one afternoon, I asked Philip 
  Berrigan if he thought men could join together and bring peace to the world 
  before the coming of Christ. Of course his view of that event and mine--and 
  I didn't quite know what I meant by it at the time--were surely not the same. 
  He thought for a few moments, and then said, &quot;yes.&quot; </font></p>

  Nan said that she was returning to West Virginia, to the log cabin we hoped 
  to build that year, and to the community of friends we had made since moving 
  into those hills. I followed her back to Lincoln County. There was more to learn, 
  much more to understand. Jimmy Carter was about to appear on the world scene, 
  and the language, the concept and the meaning of peace itself was preparing 
  to suffer its worst, and most subtle assault. I believe that it was the Friends 
  Service Committee (the Quakers), that nominated Carter for the Nobel Peace Prize 
  which he has just been awarded. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OSLO, Norway__Jimmy Carter accepted 
    the Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday--long awaited for his diplomacy in the Middle 
    East in the 70s--with a warning to nations to avoid bloodshed in resolving 
    their conflicts. With the world on edge over terrorism and a possible U.S.-led 
    attack on Iraq, the former U.S. president told an audience at the Nobel ceremony 
    that war only breeds more war.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;War may sometimes be a necessary 
    evil,&quot; he said, &quot;But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, 
    never a good. We will never learn to live together in peace by killing each 
    other's children.&quot; </font>The Associated Press<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The problem here is not George Bush's <i>newspeak</i> attitude 
  toward the protests (such protests are tolerated as long as they do not outbalance 
  or interfere with the government's sense of itself, its self-assumed right to 
  exist, its methods of conscription, or its efforts to advance the global capitalist 
  agenda), but the antiwar movement's almost certain, but mistaken assumption 
  that Jimmy Carter is speaking the same language as itself, or expressing the 
  same sentiments about war. Among the many protesters that day, Sharon Baker 
  said: &quot;I am opposed to any war, any time, anywhere, any place.&quot; These 
  are not Jimmy Carter's sentiments. He is not opposed to &quot;any war, any time, 
  anywhere, any place.&quot; He is an Augustinian, Just War theorist. He will 
  kill other people's children, but only if he has to. (Only if God forces him 
  to). And therein lies the subtle and essential difference between the mind of 
  Christ and the mind of Antichrist. Jimmy Carter is for &quot;peace&quot; in 
  the morning, but will wage &quot;war&quot; in the evening. And he will wage 
  war in the extreme against God Himself who is risen up now in the sum, and in 
  the midst of all the unfolding realities of our time, bringing this age to its 
  conclusion, and His, or rather Their own righteous order into existence. </font></p>
