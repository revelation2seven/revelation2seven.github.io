  <p align="center"><i><b>It's important that we take a hard, clear look...not 
    at some simple world, either of universal goodwill or of universal hostility, 
    but the COMPLEX, CHANGING, AND SOMETIMES DANGEROUS WORLD THAT REALLY EXISTS</b>...</i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jimmy

</blockquote>
<p><b>Imagine yourself the newly elected president of the United States. You are 
  scheduled to deliver the State of the Union address on your views of the current 
  world situation and your foreign policy to deal with it. You face the task of 
  both defining those aspects of international affairs most worthy of attention 
  and explaining the reasons for their priority. To convince citizens these issues 
  are important, you must present them AS PART OF A LARGER PICTURE OF THE WORLD...</b></p>

<p><b> ...Therefore, based on your perceptions of worl politics, you must identify 
  a general framework from which to consider global issues. You must, in short, 
  think <i>theoretically. </i>At the same time, you must be careful, because your 
  interpretation will necessarily depend on assumptions about international realities 
  that your citizens might find questionable. The effort to explain the world, 
  predict new global problems, and sell others on a policy to deal with them is 
  bound to result in controversy because even reasonable people often see realities 
  differently.</b></p>
<p><b>When leaders face these kinds of intellectual challenges, they fortunately

  THEY CAN DRAW GUIDANCE...</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>...In this chapter we distinguish among major theoretical perspectives 
  policymakers and scholars use to interpret international relations. Since the 
  perceived &quot;realities&quot; of international affairs that these theories 
  seek to explain influenced their content, we will examine how perceived changes 
  in underlying international conditions have shaped various theories. In addition, 
  our review of contending political theories will identify the intellectual heritage 
  that informs this book.</b></p>
