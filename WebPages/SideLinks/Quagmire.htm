  <b>Rebel War Spirals Out of Control As U.S. Intelligence Loses the Plot<br>
  By Peter Beaumont and Patrick Graham<br>
  The Guardian</b></p>
<p>Sunday 02 November 2003</p>
<p>The ghosts of Vietnam are returning as Baathists, zealots, criminals, tribal 
  leaders and al Qaeda unite in a deadly alliance of hatred.</p>
<p> Sharp disagreements are emerging between the US and the UK over the exact 
  nature of the Iraqi resistance, amid warnings that the US is losing the intelligence 
  war against the rebels. After eight days in which Iraqi fighters have scored 
  a series of major blows to the coalition and its Iraqi allies, intelligence 
  and military officials in Iraq and on both sides of the Atlantic are at odds 
  over whether they are fighting a Saddam-led movement or a series of disparate 
  partisan groups. They are just as divided on finding a way to halt the escalating 
  violence. </p>
<p> The latest violence comes amid increasingly bleak assessments from Washington, 
  where the latest attacks have been compared in the media to Vietnam's 1968 Tet 
  Offensive against US forces and described by Sandy Berger, a former National 
  Security Adviser to President Bill Clinton, as a 'classic guerrilla war'. The 
  comments follow leaked assessments by both the US pro-consul in Iraq, Ambassador 
  Paul Bremer, and US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that war against the resistance 
  was going less well than planned, with the latter describing a 'long, hard slog'. 
  By last week that long, hard slog had seen attacks on coalition forces and the 
  Iraqis co-operating with them reaching a level of 33 a day - more than twice 
  the level in July. Anti-coalition fighters have ratcheted up the scale of attacks 
  on schools, police and politicians, while assaults on the US-led forces have 
  become more confident and sophisticated. </p>
<p> US and UK officials admit that at the centre of the worsening crisis - which 
  has seen the UN and other aid agencies withdraw international staff from the 
  country following the bombing of the Red Cross headquarters in Baghdad - is 
  a continuing failure of hard intelligence on exactly who is behind the resistance. 
  The urgency of the problem was underlined by comments by a former CIA director 
  last week that unless the coalition forces get a grip on the intelligence-gathering 
  problem - in particular building relationships with ordinary Iraqis - it may 
  be too late. </p>
<p> 'We're at a crossroads,' Stansfield Turner, told the Christian Science Monitor. 
  'If in the next few weeks we don't persuade the Iraqi on the street that we're 
  going to straighten things out... we won't get that intelligence.' A mark of 
  that failure, say officials, has been the inability of coalition forces and 
  the intelligence and policing agencies available to them to solve any of the 
  major bombings that began in August. </p>
<p> 'The fundamental issue with counter-insurgency warfare is intelligence. Intelligence 
  is what matters and it is 90 per cent of the battle,' Gordon Adams, a former 
  associate director for national security, told the New York Times. 'It's knowing 
  who they are, where they are and when they act. If we know anything from Vietnam 
  and the various things that have gone on in Afghanistan and Iraq, it is that 
  our humint [human intelligence] is terrible. We know that we were woefully under-prepared 
  in general.' </p>
<p> It is a view shared in part by British officials, who concede that attempts 
  to infiltrate the resistance have been without success. Others are sharply critical 
  of how the intelligence war against the rebels has been handled. They point 
  to a woeful shortage of Arab linguists and analysts familiar with Arab culture 
  in the US-run sector, despite being six months into the insurgency. To counter 
  this, Pentagon officials briefed last week that some of these specialists working 
  among the 1,400-strong Iraq Survey Group on the unsuccessful search for stockpiles 
  of unconventional weapons would be transferred to this effort. </p>
<p> So who exactly is the resistance? In recent days American officials have briefed 
  US papers for the first time that Saddam Hussein may be playing a significant 
  role in co-ordinating and directing attacks by his loyalists, despite conceding 
  such reports could not be corroborated. The claims are based in part on reports 
  that Saddam met Izzat Ibrahim, a senior Iraqi general suspected by American 
  officials of playing a significant role in organising the resistance and co-ordinating 
  with Ansar al-Islam, linked to al Qaeda. </p>
<p> The depiction by these Pentagon officials of the structure of the resistance 
  - though tentatively expressed - suggest a hierarchical organisation, led by 
  former Saddam officials, with Saddam at its head, and allied to groups of foreign 
  jihadists and al Qaeda under a single command. Whether true or not, it is a 
  politically convenient description of the resistance for the Bush regime, suggesting 
  as it does that the rebels represent no more than the desperate remains of Saddam's 
  regime with no wider resonance, despite escalating attacks. It is not, however, 
  recognised by British officials. The picture that they paint of what is going 
  on in Iraq is a more chaotic and a far more dangerous one. </p>
<p> 'What we are looking at,' one UK official told The Observer, 'is not some 
  monolithic organisation with a clear command. That would be far easier for us 
  to deal with and get into. Instead, we are looking at lots of different groups 
  with different agendas. They are locally organised with each having its loyalty 
  focused on middle-ranking former commanders.' What he describes is a network 
  of partisan-type groups without a central command and links between them based 
  on personal relationships - an organic rather than monolithic structure. The 
  groups' communications - based, say Iraqis, on couriers, often teenage boys, 
  to carry messages - have been equally difficult for the coalition to penetrate. 
  And they have very little difficulty in getting materiel for attacks or the 
  money to finance the operations. Iraqi military doctrine under Saddam, especially 
  after the first Gulf war, long envisaged the risk of a second US-led invasion 
  that would attempt to depose the regime. The consequence was the placement across 
  the country of hidden caches of weapons, explosives, fuel and cash, all in vast 
  amounts - everything required to run a guerrilla war. </p>
<p> 'We are looking at three categories of group involved in the resistance,' 
  said one official. 'There are ex-Baathists, especially in the Sunni triangle 
  [where the majority of Special Republican guard and members of Saddam's security 
  organisations were traditionally recruited from]. Then there are groups like 
  Ansar al-Islam and groups that may be affiliated to al Qaeda or sympathetic 
  to them. Finally, there are foreign jihadists who have been drawn to Iraq to 
  fight Americans.' It is a view endorsed by a former colonel in the Iraqi security 
  services interviewed by The Observer. 'It is a mixture of different groups - 
  former Mukhabarat [security services], religious groups and Baath party members. 
  If Saddam is involved in the resistance, as some at the Pentagon are claiming, 
  then he believes he is just one leader among many. 'Saddam is playing some role 
  but he is not the only one. Some groups may not even know he is leading them. 
  I think that he is moving around meeting as many of these groups as possible. 
</p>
<p> 'These groups are separate, but work together more and more as the various 
  leaders are contacting each other. Most people are not doing it because of Saddam, 
  but for religious or nationalist reasons. Some are criminals, who under other 
  circumstances few people would have anything to do with. Some are paid, but 
  not many.' He suggested that last Sunday's rocket attack on the Al Rashid Hotel 
  showed a level of sophistication that was new for the resistance. An underground 
  cell working with staff at the hotel, which was once virtually run by the Iraqi 
  secret service, watched the arrival of guests while street cleaners worked with 
  an underground cell to position the rocket launcher. After the arrival of Under-Secretary 
  of Defence Paul Wolfowitz, the launcher, disguised as a generator, was remotely 
  activated. </p>
<p> Most worrying of all is the emergence of a broad, post-Saddam ideology across 
  the groups. And if recent polling in Baghdad is to be believed, it is rapidly 
  gaining currency with ordinary Iraqis. It is crudely simple, insisting that 
  the US-led occupation is an assault against both Islam and the wider Arab nation, 
  that Iraqis must resist and that anyone who assists the occupiers is an enemy 
  as much as US troops. But it is not only the home-grown resistance that is concerning 
  the coalition. It has also been struggling to prevent a wave of devastating 
  suicide bombings against a variety of targets which Western intelligence officials 
  increasingly believe may be being carried out by foreigners coming to fight 
  the Americans in Iraq. Two officials have told The Observer that they do not 
  believe the suicide bombings are 'Iraqi style'. 'It does not feel to us like 
  their way of doing things,' said one. </p>
<p>The comments follow warnings from intelligence officials across Europe, reported 
  in yesterday's New York Times, that since the summer hundreds of young militants 
  have left Europe to join the resistance in Iraq, a trend which is also in evidence 
  across the Arab world. </p>
<p> The paper quotes Jean-Louis Brugui&egrave;re, France's leading investigative 
  judge on terrorism, who said that dozens of young Muslim men had left France 
  for Iraq since the summer, inspired by the exhortations of al Qaeda leaders, 
  even if they were not trained by the movement. According to the Iraqi colonel 
  interviewed by The Observer: 'There is no specific information on these car 
  bombs.' He believes that the attacks are 'probably organised by religious Iraqi 
  groups but carried out by foreigners who want to become martyrs during Ramadan.' 
  But a question that is also worrying coalition and other officials is precisely 
  who is organising these would-be foreign fighters and putting them in touch 
  with resistance groups. </p>
<p> One disturbing theory being investigated is that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a former 
  Afghan jihadist of Jordanian-Palestinian extraction who knows the al Qaeda leadership, 
  may have recently entered Iraq and be organising foreign fighters the way he 
  once organised them in Afghanistan. According to the former Iraqi security services 
  colonel, 'These Saudis, Yemenis, Algerians, Syrians and Jordanians were trained 
  for these kinds of operations and want to die. They are now working with various 
  resistance groups whether they are religious or not.' </p>

  <b>A Fiction Shattered by America's Aggression<br>
  By William Pfaff<br>
  The International Herald Tribune</b> </p>
<p> Sunday 02 November 2003</p>
<p>The U.S. in the world</p>
<p> PORTO, Portugal - More than nine months into the Iraq crisis, meetings between 
  West Europeans and Americans of goodwill remain strained nondialogues in which 
  most of the American participants find it hard to admit that the catastrophic 
  loss of America's reputation abroad has anything to do with them. Such a meeting 
  in this old port city last weekend produced the usual American citations of 
  scandalous incidents of foreign anti-Americanism. The German Marshall Fund statistics 
  were circulated, showing that the gap between American and European attitudes 
  is widening and that Europeans increasingly disapprove of America's position 
  as the sole superpower.</p>
<p> The Americans' response is nearly always that there must have been some failure 
  in communication. Perhaps the United States should &quot;consult&quot; more, 
  they say. &quot;It's as if they can't hear,&quot; said an Irishman who had thought 
  of himself as one of America's best friends abroad.</p>
<p> But every nation has a story - a narrative it tells to explain its place in 
  the flow of history and to give meaning to its actions. The American story since 
  1942 (and before) is well known, and is considered by Americans and others a 
  story reflecting responsibility and high-mindedness. Despite aberrations in 
  Vietnam and Latin America, the American story of responsible world leadership 
  has been accepted among democracies as an essentially valid account of the role 
  modern America played during the years leading up to the collapse of the Soviet 
  Union. The problem today is that, in the view of many others, the story has 
  changed. Another one has taken its place, even though most Americans deny that 
  this is so.</p>
<p> Because of the powerful Calvinist influence - predestinarian and theocratic 
  - in American Protestantism, the American story has always described a confrontation 
  between the Elect and the Evil. When the Soviet Union no longer fulfilled the 
  latter role, Washington tried out several possible successors, finally settling 
  on &quot;rogue nations&quot; - those professing radically un-American ideas 
  and that give evidence of wanting to possess nuclear deterrents. Their feebleness, 
  however, tended to diminish their credibility when cast in the role of global 
  Evil.</p>
<p> Then came Sept. 11, and the problem was solved. The rogue nations now became 
  the Axis of Evil. They were integral to a vast international threat, capable 
  of striking the United States itself. Moreover, this threat more or less resembled 
  (less, actually, than more) the clash between civilizations that Samuel Huntington 
  had warned would be the &quot;next world war.&quot; Americans declared that 
  &quot;everything has changed, and nothing can be the same.&quot; The nation 
  was at war with &quot;terror.&quot;</p>
<p> Terror expressed itself through Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Palestinian suicide-bombers, 
  South American narco-terrorists, Chechen separatists and Moro separatists in 
  the southern Philippines. Terror was a ubiquitous force that could ultimately 
  manifest itself in weapons of mass destruction, supplied by the rogue states. 
  Hence, preventive wars were necessary; Afghanistan and Iraq had to be invaded 
  to seize terror's leaders and their nuclear and biological weapons. International 
  law must step aside. But what actually has happened during the past nine months 
  is something Americans have yet to grasp, and that others have yet to say out 
  loud: People outside the United States have stopped believing the American story.</p>
<p> They don't think terrorism is an Evil force the United States is going to 
  defeat. They say instead that terrorism is a way people wage war when they don't 
  have F-16's or armored divisions. They say that Chechens, Moros, Taliban, Colombian 
  insurgents, Palestinian bombers and Iraqi enemies of the U.S. occupation do 
  not really make up a single global phenomenon that the world must mobilize to 
  defeat. They say that, actually, they had never really believed the American 
  story in the first place. They had listened to it because Washington said it, 
  and they respected Washington. Now they don't. This is the reason why there 
  is trouble between the United States and the countries that have been its allies. 
  And this is why it may indeed prove true that between them, things &quot;will 
  never be the same.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><b>Think the Days of the Draft are Gone? Think Again <br>
  By William Rivers Pitt </b><br>
</p>
<p>September 11th., 2002 </p>
<p>2.7 million Americans served in Vietnam. 304,000 of them were wounded in action, 
  and over 75,000 of those were disabled by their injuries. As of Memorial Day 
  1996, there were 58,202 names listing the dead on the long, black monument in 
  Washington, D.C. Approximately 1,300 men are still listed as missing in action. 
</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people today believe a return of the draft is an 
  absurd notion, and the names on that wall stand tall among them. The insanity 
  loosed within this nation when the draft was violently resisted stands as another 
  firebreak against a politician who would call for its reinstatement. Finally, 
  most Americans believe that our armed forces are utterly invincible and fully 
  capable of performing any task we require beyond our borders. We stomped the 
  Iraqi army, then the largest mechanized military force in the Middle East, like 
  a roach back in 1991. After 9/11, we rampaged through Afghanistan. </p>
<p>Perceptions of this nature are dangerous, for they depart in the extreme from 
  reality. Though we have succeeded in shattering the Taliban and dispersing al 
  Qaeda in Afghanistan, the threat posed by the latter terrorist organization 
  remains quite real. The cultural and tribal rifts in that region will require 
  a massive American military presence there for years. The recent car-bomb attack 
  against Afghan president Karzai demonstrates that, though we may have won all 
  the battles over there, we are far from obtaining victory. </p>
<p>The situation in Afghanistan will be a significant tax on our military resources, 
  unless we walk away as we did once the Soviets disengaged in 1989, which would 
  guarantee once again the rise of fundamentalist chaos there. We have reaped 
  that whirlwind once already, and will hold this tiger by the tail until further 
  notice. The fact that we have significant interest in the natural resources 
  of that region only cements the permanence of our presence there. </p>
<p>Our military presence in the Middle East is already significant, and has begun 
  to steadily increase since George W. Bush began to beat the war drum against 
  Iraq. A great many officers ensconced in the Pentagon strongly believe our military 
  will become far too stretched in a repeat engagement with Saddam Hussein's forces. 
  Few will say openly that they fear defeat, and in fact the odds of losing a 
  war in Iraq are extremely low, but the pressure placed upon our military resources 
  will be extreme. The potential for explosive upheaval in the Middle East should 
  we make war on Iraq further exacerbates this. Between Afghanistan and Iraq, 
  the United States military is reaching mission capacity. </p>
<p>Still, the idea that forced military conscription of Americans could come again 
  is a foolish one, right? Consider the following scenario. Consider it with particular 
  care if you have loved ones of battle age. </p>
<p>In July of 2002, the Defense Policy Board - a powerful group at the ear of 
  the Bush administration which is chaired by former Reagan Defense Department 
  official Richard Perle - listened with great interest to a briefing delivered 
  by emissaries from a Rand Corporation think tank. The thrust of the briefing 
  was that Iraq should be considered only the beginning of a protracted campaign 
  to bring &quot;regime change&quot; throughout the Middle East. The final Powerpoint 
  slide of this presentation described &quot;Iraq as the tactical pivot, Saudi 
  Arabia as the strategic pivot, (and) Egypt as the prize.&quot; </p>
<p>Though the administration publicly distanced itself from this briefing once 
  it was exposed on the pages of the Washington Post, going so far as to have 
  Bush abase himself before visiting Saudi royalty, the substance of that talk 
  surely resonated within the men calling the shots in D.C. Richard Perle is a 
  famously hawkish neo-conservative who springs from the same think-tank environment 
  as those who gave the briefing. The same goes for Secretary of Defense Donald 
  Rumsfeld, and his assistant Paul Wolfowitz. These three men, along with the 
  like-minded Vice President Cheney, are fully in control of both American foreign 
  policy and the War on Terror. A plan for region-wide regime change in the Middle 
  East suits them right down to the ground. </p>
<p>Noted MIT professor Noam Chomsky, writing earlier this week in the Guardian, 
  described the invitation for more terrorism on American shores should we attack 
  Iraq. &quot;No one,&quot; wrote Chomsky, &quot;including Donald Rumsfeld, can 
  realistically guess the possible costs and consequences. Radical Islamist extremists 
  surely hope that an attack on Iraq will kill many people and destroy much of 
  the country, providing recruits for terrorist actions.&quot; The inference is 
  clear: Any war in that region will spawn a new and terrible wave of attacks 
  against this country. Any war in that region is exactly what the terrorists 
  are hoping for. Fresh recruits, soaked in rage, will flood into their open arms. 
</p>
<p>The unfolding scenario becomes all too clear. If Bush is pressed into a conflict 
  with Iraq by the hawkish, neo-conservative platoon of Perle, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz 
  and Cheney, America will once again suffer a catastrophic terrorist attack. 
  The result will be the complete militarization of America, complete with martial 
  law and the suspension of all basic civil rights. Bush administration officials 
  have already admitted as much when asked in the last year what the result of 
  another attack would be. In the aftermath, the Bush administration will assuredly 
  push for that region-wide regime change in the Middle East, but will be unable 
  to do so without forced conscriptions, because the military is currently stretched 
  too thin. Thus, the draft. </p>
<p>Farfetched? Hardly. In fact, there is presently in Congress a bill pending 
  that would require military conscription. H.R. 3598, entitled &quot;Universal 
  Military and Training Act of 2001,&quot; was introduced into the House of Representatives 
  on December 20th, 2001 by Republican Rep. Nick Smith of Michigan. It calls for 
  the drafting of all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 22 for military 
  service. Even those who would declare themselves conscientious objectors would 
  be drafted and given military training, whereupon they would be peeled off to 
  another Federal agency to serve out their term. </p>
<p>At present, H.R. 3598 languishes in the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, 
  which is attached to the House Committee on Armed Services, because it has not 
  enjoyed enough support in Congress. Should the very real scenario described 
  above unfold, and specifically if this nation is attacked again, H.R. 3598 could 
  well enjoy an incredible surge in popularity. </p>
<p>There is a high-stakes game of poker being played within the administration 
  right now. The hawks are holding aces and betting them. Around them on the card 
  table, the chips are piled high. Your sons, your brothers, your friends are 
  in that pile. So are you, if you are of age. After September 11th, the only 
  thing likely to happen is that which was previously inconceivable. Could war 
  in Iraq bring terrorism back to our country? Could it lead to a regional conflagration 
  in the Middle East? Could it lead to another draft? I wouldn't bet against it.

<p align="center"> <b>DON'T MENTION THE DEAD</b></p>
<p align="center">By Gary Younge<br>
  The Guardian UK</p>
<p> Friday 07 November 2003</p>
<p>When the body of US soldier Artimus Brassfield was flown to the military mortuary 
  at Dover, Delaware, there were no TV pictures of a flag-covered coffin and hero's 
  salute - the White House has banned media coverage at the base. But can Bush's 
  efforts to hide the body bags quell growing public disquiet over the death toll 
  in Iraq? Gary Younge reports.</p>
<p> When the silver casket lid went down on Artimus Brassfield a reflexive, convulsive 
  sob echoed through Ebenezer ministries. In the seconds it took for the coffin 
  to be draped with the American flag, Pastor Seon Thompson reminded the congregation 
  that this was a celebration of his life. By the time the drummer had given them 
  the beat for &quot;He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the lord,&quot; 
  they had found their voice.</p>
<p> Brassfield, 22, also went to be a soldier in the 4th infantry division of 
  the American army. By all accounts, throughout his short life there were only 
  two things he really wanted to do - play basketball and join the army. And so 
  the tank driver from Flint, Michigan, was playing basketball at a military base 
  in Samiri, Iraq, on October 24 when a mortar struck and killed both him and 
  26-year-old Jos&eacute; Mora instantly. Brassfield was so determined to enlist 
  that he took the entrance test three times. But while he enjoyed serving in 
  the forces, his letters home suggest he had mixed feelings about serving in 
  Iraq. His concerns were personal, not political. The weather was too hot and 
  he was homesick. He asked his mother not to send him chocolate as it would only 
  melt and he looked forward to buying a truck with Michigan plates and eventually 
  opening his own barber's shop. &quot;I'm pretty blessed to be in Saddam's home 
  town, Tikrit,&quot; he wrote in an email to his father. &quot;It's very nice 
  here other than the fact that we're in Iraq and there ain't no escaping it.&quot; 
  In a letter to his mother, he tells her: &quot;Be thankful to the Lord that 
  we are American because I don't see how these people live like this.&quot; </p>
<p> Brassfield was buried with full honours, the purple heart and bronze star 
  presented to his wife Andrea. In the distance, the bugle played. It was not 
  clear whether it was just a man puffing his cheeks or really playing. Since 
  last month the military has been using &quot;ceremonial buglers&quot; at some 
  military funerals - a tape that can be inserted into the bugle and sounds like 
  the real thing. &quot;We've got 1,800 veterans dying each day, and only 500 
  buglers,&quot; said Lt Col Cynthia Colin, a defence department spokeswoman. 
  &quot;We needed to do something to fill the void.&quot; </p>
<p> The mother of Donald Wheeler, who was killed 11 days earlier by a rocket-propelled 
  grenade, sent her condolences to the Brassfields. &quot;I hope you never wonder 
  whether or not your son's death was in vain,&quot; she wrote. &quot;He died 
  for my freedom and your freedom too. What a hero!&quot; The Brassfields have 
  no doubt that Artimus was a hero. His father, Cary, who served in the military 
  himself, says he is proud that his son served his country, but he is not sure 
  his heroism was put to good use: &quot;Evidently the war is over and yet we 
  still have people dying every day. He was a sitting duck. Who is going to be 
  the next person? I don't want to say my patriotism is diminishing. But I'm losing 
  confidence in the purpose of us being there.&quot; Artimus's aunt, Karmen Williams, 
  believes President Bush should withdraw the troops now. &quot;He needs to say 
  enough is enough, just bring our boys home.&quot; </p>
<p> For years political orthodoxy had it that America would no longer know days 
  like these. Not because it was shy about going to war, but because after Vietnam 
  it was determined not to incur large numbers of casualties in doing so. The 
  US military would bomb from a great height or use proxies to enforce its will. 
  Public opinion would endorse the country's involvement in most military conflicts, 
  so long as the nation did not have to endure the sight of its young men and 
  women coming home in body bags. As Henry Shelton, the chairman of the joint 
  chiefs-of-staff, said in 1999, a decision to use military force is based in 
  part on whether it will pass &quot;the Dover test&quot; - public reaction to 
  bodies arriving at the country's only military mortuary in Dover, Delaware. 
</p>
<p> Dr Joseph Dawson, a military historian at Texas A&amp;M university, says the 
  American public's response to casualties is qualified by what they believe the 
  soldiers are fighting for. &quot;If the cause seems significant enough then 
  Americans will bear the loss,&quot; he says, pointing to the huge death tolls 
  in the second world war and the civil war. &quot;But if the cause no longer 
  appears to be significant they will not. It's still rather too early to read 
  public opinion about this cause.&quot; But now almost every day there is a funeral 
  like Artimus's somewhere in the country. With victory already declared, two-thirds 
  believe the number of casualties are unacceptable and more than half believe 
  that the US will get bogged down in Iraq, according to a Washington Post poll 
  earlier this week. </p>
<p> The shooting down of the Chinook helicopter on Sunday ended the deadliest 
  week in the war and intensified pressure on the president to address the issue 
  of casualties directly. &quot;We're now encountering deaths at rates we haven't 
  seen since Vietnam,&quot; says David Gergen, who worked in the Nixon, Ford, 
  Reagan and Clinton administrations, &quot;and I think it's important for the 
  country to hear from the president at times like these and for the families 
  to know. I think the weight is on the side of clear expression,&quot; he told 
  the New York Times. </p>
<p> At the opening of the upgraded Dover mortuary last week, Senator Joseph R 
  Biden said: &quot;The idea that this facility is opening at a time when body 
  bags are coming home is not a glad time. Thank God [the centre] is here, but 
  I wish we didn't need to build it. Everyone thought this was going to be like 
  Gulf war one, that Johnny and Jack would be home by Christmas.&quot; </p>
<p> On December 21 1989, President George Bush senior was holding a press conference 
  about the US intervention in Panama as the first American fatalities from the 
  conflict were arriving at Dover. With General Manuel Noriega still at large 
  and half of America believing the military intervention could not be regarded 
  a success while he remained so, it was a politically sensitive time. At the 
  beginning of the briefing the president had told reporters he was suffering 
  from neck pain. At the end he did a duck walk to illustrate his stiffness. That's 
  when &quot;the goof-a-meter went off the charts&quot;, as one correspondent 
  put it. </p>
<p> Unbeknown to the White House, three major news networks had moved to a split 
  screen. While the president shared his light-hearted moment with the press corps 
  on one half, America's dead were arriving in caskets on the other. It was a 
  public relations disaster. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described 
  the coverage as &quot;outrageous and unfair&quot; and vowed to express his &quot;extreme 
  dissatisfaction&quot; to the channels concerned. Less than a year later the 
  White House decreed a ban on traditional military ceremonies and media coverage 
  marking the return of the bodies of US soldiers to Dover. It was an abrupt shift 
  in policy for what had become a national wartime ritual. Along with yellow ribbons 
  and flag waving, the scenes from Dover were part of the American war experience. 
</p>
<p> For the next 12 years the ban was largely ignored, even after it was extended 
  to all military bases during the last days of the Clinton administration. But 
  this March, shortly before the war began, the Pentagon handed down a directive 
  that made it perfectly clear it expected the policy to be heeded. Bush writes 
  to each family, but his friends say he was offended by what he regarded as Clinton's 
  occasionally gushing public performances, which he felt turned private grief 
  into political gain. The trouble for Bush is that the public liked Clinton for 
  his ability to empathise. Bush's apparent reluctance to publicly identify with 
  the dead is beginning to look like a desire to disassociate himself from the 
  failure of the mission. When news of the downed Chinook came through on Sunday 
  he stayed in his ranch and let defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld meet the press. 
</p>
<p> &quot;The public wants the commander-in-chief to have proper perspective and 
  keep his eye on the big picture and the ball,&quot; says Dan Bartlett, the White 
  House communications director. &quot;At the same time, they want their president 
  to understand the hardship and sacrifice many Americans are enduring at a time 
  of war. And we believe he is striking that balance.&quot; </p>
<p> Others disagree. They say the growing number of casualties is the ball, which 
  is precisely why the Pentagon enforced the ban on coverage at Dover. &quot;You 
  can call it news control or information control of flat-out propaganda,&quot; 
  says Christopher Simpson, a communications professor at Washington's American 
  University. &quot;Whatever you call it, this is the most extensive effort at 
  spinning a war that the department of defence has ever undertaken in this country. 
  Casualties are a very important media football in any war [and] this is a qualitative 
  change.&quot; Either way, implementing the ruling has had an effect. For the 
  first time since war in the television era, the sight of flag-covered caskets 
  arriving to the salute of military colleagues and the tears of mourning relatives 
  are no longer part of the national narrative. Bush has not attended the funeral 
  of a single soldier slain in the war and refers to the casualties only in general 
  terms. Without Dover, there can be no Dover test. </p>
<p> The bald numbers of the death toll dominate political debate and public disquiet. 
  But the human impact behind those statistics has been scattered to communities 
  throughout the country. The bodies travel from a global conflict to local crises 
  without apparently touching the national consciousness. Even on a regional level 
  the deaths receive scant attention. Detroit is only 60 miles from Flint but 
  Artimus's death made neither of the city's two papers. &quot;This is the fifth 
  soldier in Flint to have died,&quot; says Ken Palmer, a reporter for the Flint 
  Journal, &quot;and the third since the president declared the war was over. 
  The first couple had a real impact. But now I think people are becoming numb.&quot; 
</p>
<p> Yesterday, Cary Brassfield woke up to the news that two more soldiers had 
  died in Iraq and the administration promise that its campaign in Iraq will be 
  unrelenting. &quot;The ones that are speaking do not have the same stakes that 
  we have,&quot; says Artimus's father. &quot;They have their political careers. 
  But our homes are being torn apart.&quot;</p>

<p>Frederick W. Kagan, author, and teacher of military history at West Point, 
  is a tax-and-spend hegemonist. In &quot;The art of war,&quot; an article from 
  the November, 2003, The New Criterion, which I found on the excellent aldaily.com 
  site, Kagan warns about the dangers of the &quot;search for 'efficiency' in 
  military affairs.&quot; Rather than an efficient military, see, the US needs 
  a massive military with intentional redundancy in equipment and functions. Or 
  is he arguing that military defense is possible and inexpensive but world hegemony 
  is expensive in blood and treasure -- and futile to boot?</p>
<p>Excerpts: </p>
<p>In each of the periods in recent history in which one might see a fundamental 
  change in the nature of war, it is true that normally one state begins with 
  a dramatic lead. Revolutionary France&#146;s ability in the 1790s to mobilize 
  vast conscript armies and to sustain that mobilization for years gave her an 
  important advantage over continental states unable to match such levels of mobilization. 
  Prussia&#146;s early and enthusiastic development of a dense railroad net and 
  of the general staff structure needed to plan for and control a railroad mobilization 
  led directly to her crushing victories over Austria in 1866 and over France 
  in 1871. The Nazis&#146; creation of a technologically advanced and highly trained 
  armored force, along with a significantly better armored warfare doctrine, led 
  directly to the destruction of the Franco-British army in 1940 In each case, 
  however, we must also consider the sequel. Napoleonic France, Imperial Germany, 
  and Nazi Germany all ultimately lost subsequent wars and were destroyed. The 
  reasons for those failures are enlightening about the limitations of the current 
  definition of revolution in military affairs. ...</p>
<p>History so far, therefore, has been very clear that &#147;asymmetrical advantages&#148; 
  gained by one state do not normally last very long. Technology and technique 
  inevitably spreads. Other states acquire either similar or counteracting capabilities. 
  The final victors of each new &#147;revolutionary&#148; epoch have not usually 
  been the states that initiated the revolution, but those that responded best 
  once the technologies and techniques had become common property. It also shows 
  that the initial successes those &#147;revolutionary&#148; states achieved have 
  tended to breed arrogance and overconfidence, hindering their ability to respond 
  as other states began to match their capabilities. Napoleonic France, Imperial 
  Germany, and Nazi Germany all ossified in their techniques after the initial 
  victories, and lost to enemies who, forced by defeat, built on their own advances 
  more successfully. </p>
<p>The search for an indefinite American &#147;asymmetrical advantage,&#148; therefore, 
  requires not merely a revolution in military affairs: it also requires a fundamental 
  revolution in human affairs of a sort never seen before. It requires that America 
  continue to change her armed forces so rapidly and successfully that no other 
  state can ever catch up&#151;indeed, that no other state in the world even try. 
  ...[F]ew if any of America&#146;s enemies will have the vast resource-stretching 
  responsibilities that America has. They will be concerned only with their own 
  region of the world and will focus their efforts on developing communications 
  and target tracking systems only over a small portion of the globe. They will 
  not need a dense global satellite constellation or the ability to project power 
  over thousands of miles. The costs to them of developing systems comparable 
  to America&#146;s, but only in a restricted geographic area, will accordingly 
  be much smaller than the price the U.S. has had to pay to achieve that capability 
  everywhere.</p>
<p>Then, too, other states can reap the benefits of modern communications systems 
  without bearing the expensive burden of basic scientific research and development. 
  Microprocessors, satellites, encrypted laser communications systems, cell phone 
  systems, and the whole host of technologies that form the basis of American 
  military superiority are now the property of the world. It will not cost America&#146;s 
  enemies anything like what it cost the U.S. to develop its capabilities, either 
  in money or in time. Since technology inevitably becomes less expensive as it 
  proliferates and as time goes on, moreover, the situation for America&#146;s 
  would-be adversaries will only improve in this regard. ...</p>
<p>When America&#146;s enemies have developed the technology and trained the people 
  who will use it, they will also have to develop the doctrines and techniques 
  to make it effective. In this regard, they have the most significant advantage 
  of all. Much of America&#146;s tested doctrine has been published, much can 
  be deduced from the CNN coverage of America&#146;s most recent wars. Once again, 
  America&#146;s enemies can start from the position of proven success that the 
  U.S. armed forces achieved, and build from there.</p>
<p>Their real advantage in this area, however, results from the fact that they 
  will be developing armed forces specifically designed to fight an enemy with 
  the same capabilities. America&#146;s military has not done so. American military 
  doctrine continues to foresee fighting enemies lacking any significant capacity 
  to deploy precision guided munitions, without dense satellite constellations 
  and communications systems, and without the ability to strike targets precisely 
  at great distances. It is one of the more troubling lessons of the history of 
  new military technology that the states that pioneer the new technologies and 
  techniques generally fail to adapt successfully to the situation in which all 
  major states have the same technologies and techniques. It remains to be seen 
  whether America will do any better than her predecessors in this regard.</p>

  <b>RUMSFELD WARNS US TROOPS COULD STAY IN IRAQ FOR MANY YEARS</b><br>
  By Rupert Cornwell in Washington<br>
  15 November 2003</p>
<p align="left">As America scrambled desperately to find a workable formula to 
  speed the handover of political power in Baghdad, Donald Rumsfeld, the Defence 
  Secretary, warned yesterday that even with a new government in place US forces 
  might remain in Iraq for two years or more.</p>
<p>Speaking as he arrived for talks in Japan - the latest country to refuse to 
  send troops to join the US-led coalition in Iraq because of rising violence 
  - Mr Rumsfeld reiterated that the political transition would be faster than 
  originally intended. But he admitted that the speed of change would not mean 
  US forces, who now number some 130,000, would leave any earlier.</p>
<p>The future political arrangements for Iraq will top the agenda during President 
  George Bush's discussions with Tony Blair during his state visit next week. 
  But Washington faces a dilemma - how to hand over political control as quickly 
  as possible without being seen to cut and run. After the sudden recall this 
  week of Paul Bremer, the chief civil administrator in Iraq, for consultations 
  in Washington, it has become clear that the old timetable calling for a constitution 
  before power is transferred has been torn up.</p>
<p>Instead the most likely sequence now is the formation of a new government, 
  drawn in part or whole from the existing US-appointed Iraqi Governing Council, 
  followed by elections early next year to a constituent assembly that would draft 
  a permanent constitution for a democratic Iraq. But several members of the 24-man 
  IGC have called for a quick withdrawal of US troops, arguing that their presence 
  only deepens public resentment and boosts sympathy for the resistance that has 
  killed more than 60 US and Allied troops this month alone. A new government, 
  dependent on the continuing military presence envisaged by Mr Rumsfeld, risked 
  appearing a mere puppet of the occupying forces. Douglas Feith, under-secretary 
  of defense for policy, said: &quot;We intend to stay the course in Iraq, but 
  we don't want to rule Iraq.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Feith, the Pentagon's third-ranking civilian official and a leading neo-conservative 
  in the Bush administration, told a meeting of the Council for Foreign Relations 
  that the goal was &quot;to transfer as much authority to Iraqis as soon as possible&quot;. 
  But he implicitly criticised the IGC, whose sluggish performance has annoyed 
  many officials in Washington. Mr Feith said the council had accomplished many 
  things but needed to do &quot;much more&quot; - a pointed reference to the December 
  15 deadline for the IGC to set a timetable for a new constitution, which it 
  may miss.</p>
<p>Washington is determined to present the faster political transition as a plan 
  devised by the Iraqis rather than something imposed on them. For the White House, 
  the important thing is to prevent events slipping out of control at the very 
  moment Democrats are rounding on Mr Bush's handling of Iraq policy. Adding to 
  Mr Bush's problems, a recent poll showed rising public scepticism about the 
  rationale on which he took America to war, with 61 per cent of people saying 
  that more time should have been allocated to the hunt for the alleged weapons 
  of mass destruction. But Mr Feith was unrepentant about the decision to invade. 
  &quot;Intelligence is never perfect but that's not grounds for inaction,&quot; 
  he said yesterday. </p>

  <b>Is Bush Doomed?</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>by Paul Craig Roberts <br>

  January 17, 2004 <br>
  </b> </p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Fear must be coursing through President Bush's veins as he realizes the Iraqi 
  trap in which the neocons have placed him. Bush is caught between an Iraqi civil 
  war and a wider insurgency. Desperate to extricate himself from the weekly carnage 
  well before the November election, Bush can neither deliver on his promise of 
  democracy via direct elections nor impose his plan for an Iraqi assembly elected 
  indirectly by caucuses. </p>
<p>If Bush delivers on his democracy promise, the Shi'ites with 60% of the population 
  will be elected, and the country will break out in civil war. If he tries to 
  water down Shi'ite representation with his plan for an assembly elected indirectly 
  by caucuses, the so far peaceful Shi'ites are likely to join the violence. </p>
<p>If the Shi'ites become violent, the insurgency would be too large to be contained 
  by our present occupying force. Moreover, the outbreak of a general rebellion 
  in Iraq would spill over throughout the Middle East where unpopular secular 
  rulers are sitting on a smoldering Islam. Our puppet in Pakistan would likely 
  bite the dust. Israel would then face countervailing Muslim nukes. </p>
<p><b>If you think more US troops are needed now in Iraq, imagine how many more 
  would be required to deal with a wider conflagration. Where would they come 
  from? The US military is already so thinly stretched that soon 40% of the occupying 
  troops will be drawn from the National Guard and reservists, resulting in tremendous 
  disruption in the affairs of tens of thousands of families. Pilots and troops 
  are shunning the cash bonuses offered for reenlistments. The troops recognize 
  a quagmire even if their neocon overlords cannot. The only source of troops 
  is the draft. </b></p>
<p>A Shi'ite insurgency that brought back the draft would deprive Bush of reelection. 
  A civil war with the prospect of a Kurdish state would bring in the Turks. On 
  January 14 Turkish prime minister Erdogan said that Turkey will intervene in 
  the event of Iraq's disintegration. The Shi'ites and the Turks are forming an 
  alliance as both have the same interest in maintaining the geographical integrity 
  of the Iraqi state. The US could come dangerously close to military conflict 
  with a NATO ally. All of this was perfectly clear well in advance of the ill-considered 
  invasion. If Bush wasn't smart enough to see it, why didn't his National Security 
  Advisor or his Secretary of State? How did a handful of neocon ideologues hijack 
  US foreign policy? </p>
<p><b>Bush did not campaign on a neocon policy of conquest in the Middle East. 
  There was no public debate over this policy. The invasion of Iraq was the private 
  agenda of the neocons. Why have the neocons not been held responsible for their 
  treason in abusing their presidential appointments to substitute their personal 
  agenda for America's agenda? Bush has been the neocon's puppet for so long that 
  he is now stuck with responsibility for their horrible mistake. With no way 
  of his own to get out of his trap, his arrogance toward the &quot;irrelevant&quot; 
  UN and our doubting allies has disappeared. Come bail me out, he pleads. </b></p>
<p><b>Bush, desperate to be extricated before doom strikes him is experiencing 
  a reality totally different from the chest-thumping of neocon megalomaniacs, 
  such as Charles Krauthammer, who declared the US so powerful as to be able to 
  &quot;reshape, indeed remake, reality on its own.&quot; Bush now knows that 
  he lacks the power to deal with the reality of Iraq. Indeed, Bush cannot even 
  deal with his own appointees.<br>
