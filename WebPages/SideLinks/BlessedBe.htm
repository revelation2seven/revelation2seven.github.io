  <p><b>A RABBI AND A DESCENDANT OF RABBIS, Moshe Mannheim was a stocky, high-cheekboned

  <p><b>Moshe was a friend of my mother's eldest brother, Shumi Schwarcz, though 
    Shumi was neither a synagogue-goer nor an ethusiastic ex-warrior. Seeing no 
    reason for the dietary laws, the daily prayers with their repetitious phrases, 
    and the countless rules and ordinances of the Orthodoxy he was born into, 
    Shumi nevertheless sought meaning in the Jewish tradition.</b></p>
  <p><b>Unlike other Orthodox Jews who would not waste time arguing with the non--observant, 
    Moshe reveled in the challange of Shumi's questions, and he applied <i>rationalism</i>, 
    Shumi's highest standard in justifying Jewish beliefs and observances. Moshe 
    never got angry or raised his voice. Strolling under alle'es of sycamore trees 
    or sitting on a bench in one of Debrecen's parks, Shumi told Moshe that he 
    could not understand HOW AN ENLIGHTENED JEW IN PROGRESSIVE CENTRAL EUROPE 
    COULD REMAIN BOUND BY WORDS THAT ONE MAN HEARD MORE THAN 3,000 YEARS AGO IN 
    THE SINAI WILDERNESS...</b></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>...During the Second World War, Moshe qualified for an exemption from 
    anti-Jewish law on account of his outstanding military record from the First 
    World War. Unlike the rest of Hungary's Jews, Moshe did not have to join a 
    labor battalion, and his wife and their two children were not deported. </b></p>
  <p><b>A few days after the Russians drove out the German and Hungarian armies 
    from Debrecen in October 1944, Shumi found his way back from a labor battalion 
    to what used to be his home. The two friends met by chance on Market Street, 
    the town's broad, busy main thoroughfare. They were overjoyed seeing each 
    other alive. But within seconds their conversation turned somber. </b></p>
  <p><b>Shumi said he did not as yet know the whereabouts of his mother, and his 
    wife and their five-year old daughter. Moshe said his wife and their two children, 
    a daughter and a son, died in the final days of the Nazi rule; THE LAST ALLIED 
    BOMBING RAID FLATTENED THEIR APARTMENT BUILDING. Moshe happened to be out 
    on an errand, and now he wished that he too had died with his family. </b></p>
  <p><b>After Shumi expressed his condolences, he said he suspected that his own 
    family might have perished in Auschwitz. But as long as he had not heard from 
    an eyewitness, he could not and would not give up hope that they might still 
    be alive. Moshe shook his head. &quot;But my dear Shumi, there is no hope,&quot; 
    he said softly. &quot;By now we know in Auschwitz the oldest and the youngest 
    were killed right away.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Ezekiel. 
    chapter 9)</font><b>. </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR FAITH?&quot; SHUMI BURST OUT, UNABLE TO ACCEPT

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)...</font><b>Something 
    snapped in gentle Moshe. Ignoring the crowd that quickly collected, many of 
    whom knew who he was, HE BEGAN SCREAMING. HE CALLED GOD A MURDERER, A CRIMINAL 
    WHO CUT DOWN INNUMERABLE FAMILY TREES, AND AN ENEMY OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE. 
    HE SAID HE WISH HE HAD NEVER CHANTED A BLESSING. HE REGRETTED THANKING GOD 
    FOR CREATION, FOR THE TORAH, FOR SUSTENANCE, FOR HIS CHILDREN, AND FOR ALL 
    THE MANY WONDROUS DIVINE GIFTS THAT AN OBSERVANT JEW MUST EXPRESS GRATITUDE 
    EVERY DAY. FINALLY, SHAKING HIS FISTS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HEAVENS, HE 
    CURSED GOD, AGAIN AND AGAIN, AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE, PRONOUNCING THE OPPOSITES 
    OF THE BLESSINGS IN THE EIGHTEEN BENEDICTIONS, the centerpiece prayer in the 
    synagogue liturgy.</b></p>
  <p><b>Moshe's rage stunned Shumi. He did not try to interrupt because he later 
    explained, THE CURSES </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Moshe's 
    deep lament</font><b>) SEEMED TO HIM AKIN TO A PRAYER, and he had been taught 
    not to interrupt a prayer for fear of cancelling its effectiveness. &quot;Besides,&quot; 
    Shumi added,&quot;he could not be stopped.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>What made Shumi's insides turn into stone was the realization that he 
    had been foolish in persisting in his hopes for hs own family. For the first 
    time he undestood what others did not know or were reluctant to break to him: 
    His immediate family was no more. Nevertheless, he found strength to address 
    his thoughts to Moshe. &quot;Your loss is much greater than mine,&quot; Shumi 
    said. &quot;You lost your God as well.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>The two bereaved men hugged nd kissed on both cheeks, and each went his 
    way.</b></p>
  <p><b>On two occasions Moshe attempted suicide...A year after the war's end, 
    however, he met a woman 17 years younger than he, who had just returned from 
    Auschwitz. They fall in love and married. A year later, she gave birth to 
    a girl who was given the names Eva Terez, after the daughter and the wife 
    Moshe had lost.</b></p>
  <p><b>In the mid-1960s, Eva married one of her father's students, AND THE COUPLE 
    WENT TO VIENNA FOR A WEEKEND AND FROM THERE, IN VIOLATION OF HUNGARIAN LAW, 
    EMIGRATED TO ISRAEL. Then Moshe's second wife died after a long illness. In 
    1968 Moshe petitioned Hungary's communist authorities to make an exception 
    for him--he was 70 years old and lived alone--and to disregard the state policy 
    of punishing families whose members left the country illegally and permit 
    him to go to the land of his forbears. Eventually his request was granted.</b></p>
  <p><b>After the loss of his first family, Moshe stopped praying, and he avoided 
    he synagogue. Except for fasting on Yom Kippur--which he did at home &quot;as 
    an act of solidarity with fellow Jews,&quot; he explained--he refused to have 
    anything to do with the laws of Orthodoxy. But once in Israel he felt the 
    tug of small pressures from his family that included an observant young nephew, 
    a particular favorite, who remeinded him of the son he had lost.</b></p>
  <p><b>One more time Moshe fell in love and married. His third wife, a soft-spoken 
    widow a few years younger than he, longed for tradition, though she said nothing, 
    afraid to tear open old wounds. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(But 
    we must)</font><b>. Nevertheless, Moshe understood the dialect of her silences. 
    Little by little, step by step, and with reservations, Moshe returned to the 
    faith of his youth, first keeping the Sabbath and celebrating other holy days, 
    then attending synagogue services, and finally, following all the many hundreds 
    of rules and customs of Orthodoxy.</b></p>
  <p><b>In his eighties, Moshe went back to school, and qualified as a scribe 
    of religious documents. He specialized in mezuzot. On ascrap of parchment 
    small than his palm, he copied the Biblical text about the Almighty and Hid 
    readiness to shield His people from all harm. Tradition maintains that a mezuzah 
    has the power to protect a home and all who live there. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">( 
    But take heed...Deuteronomy, chapter 6)</font><b>. </b></p>
  <p><b>In 1992, at age 94 and at peace with his God and with himself, Moshe was 
    gathered to his ancestors. At his request he was buried in Jerusalem; his 
    two grandsons, whom he called his sons, said Kaddish for him.</b></p>
  <p><b>Moshe;s story may be read as a parable of faith triumphing over despair, 
    love over anger, and life over death. Yet for me </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
    author)</font><b>, all the loving words I read and heard from my family about 
    the miraculous restoration of his private world cannot undo a single one of 
    his curses. NOW THAT UNCLE SHUMI IS BURIED IN OUR FAMILY CEMETARY IN HIS NATIVE 
    VILLAGE, I am heir to the memory of Moshe's curses. Since childhood I have 
    imagined them as a string of explosives that set the air on fire. I can see 
    that fire burning whenever someone cites the Biblical passage on Moses coming 
    upon the Thorn Bush which &quot;burned with Fire&quot; yet,&quot;was not consumed.&quot; 
    and, later on, climbing Mount Sinai, &quot;THE MOUNTAIN BURNING WITH FIRE 
    UP TO THE HEART OF THE HEAVENS.&quot;</b></p>
