  <p><font size="+2">THE RISE OF FASCISM</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(IN AUSTRIA AND BOHEMIA)</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">By F. L. Carsten</font></p>
  <p align="left"><b>The Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary was a much weaker state 
    than the German Empire...Above all, only the political aspirations of the 
    Hungarians were satisfied...while those of the many Slav nationalities remained 
    unfulfilled. In the course of the nineteenth century the Czechs, the Poles, 
    the Slovenes acquired their own middle and educated classes, hence their demands 
    for political concessions became louder. But such concessions would have threatened 
    the positions of the Germans who were the leading nationality in the Austrian 
    half of the Dual Monarchy, especially in areas with a mixed population, such 
    as Bohemia. The population of Vienna, Prague and other towns were growing 
    apace--by 1920 Vienna had more than 2,000, 000 inhabitants--but the middle 
    and lower classes felt far from secure. Apart from the rising demands of the 
    rising non-German nationalities, there was the growing concentration which 
    deprived many a small man of his livelihood. In the thirty years following 
    upon the abolition of guild privileges in 1859 in Vienna alone the enterprises 
    of 35,000 artisans were seized for default.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>THERE WAS ANOTHER THREAT, much more real than in Germany. 
    Until the middle of the nineteenth century the Jewish population of Vienna 
    had been very small, but in 1910 175,000 inhabitants of the capital were classified 
    s Jews, more than eight percent of the population. JEWS WERE NOT ONLY EXTREMELY 
    PROMINENT IN BANKING, BUT ALSO IN OTHER BRANCHES OF ECONOMIC LIFE; &quot;IT 
    IS SAFE TO SAY THAT BY 1914 THE INDUSTRY AND TRADE OF VIENNA WERE TO AN OVERWHELMING 
    EXTENT IN JEWISH HANDS.&quot; Many Jews entered the professions, journalism 
    and civil service. In the University of Vienna in 1880, 38.6 per cent of the 
    medical students were Jewish, and 22.3 per cent of the students reading <i>law</i>--at 
    a time when the Jewish percentage of the population in general was percent 
    five per cent. In 1890 the figure for the whole university was 33.6 per cent. 
    IN LITERATURE, THE THEATRE, AND IN INTELLECTUAL AFFAIRS IN GENERAL, JEWS SOON 
    OCCUPIED LEADING POSITIONS. If Jews were politically active they were Liberals, 
    hence any anti-liberal tendency might easily turn into anti-Semitism.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Moreover, in addition, many of the Jews living in Vienna 
    and other towns had but recently COME FROM GALICIA or another eastern province 
    of the monarchy. They differed strongly from the other inhabitants in their 
    language, their clothing, their whole way of life, and aroused wide-spread 
    anti-Semitic feeling. Growing competition by Jewish traders and craftsmen 
    had the same result. Anti-Semitism equally appealed to the students and the 
    members of the professions in which many Jews were to be found. Open and organized 
    anti-Semitic propaganda resulted from the financial crash of 1873 which affected 
    large numbers of the Viennese. Popular passions were aroused by it and remained 
    strong thereafter. LARGE NUMBERS HELD THE JEWS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRASH WHICH 
    WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF A LEADING BANK AND THE COLLAPSE OF MANY COMPANIES 
    IN ITS WAKE.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Anti-Semitism became particularly strong among the students. 
    The Viennese <i>Burschenschaft </i>'Libertas' expelled its Jewish members 
    in 1878, and soon after forbade its members to accept Jews as partners in 
    a duel. (?) The Prague 'Teutonia' excluded Jews in 1879; ten years later all 
    the Austrian <i>Burschenschaften</i> decided to accept only Aryans as members...this 
    went parallel with Pan-German sentiments which--in Austria--meant a desire 
    to join the new German Reich, preferring the Hohenzollern to the Hapsburg 
    Empire...In the same year the Austrian flag and national anthem were insulted 
    openly in the same city at a congress of scientists....</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>It seems that Schonerer's anti-Semitism also derived from 
    these circles. At first it was fired by economic motives, DISLIKE OF THE EFFECTS 
    OF JEWISH CAPITALISM, THE JEWISH PRESS, AND THE JEWISH LIBERAL PROPAGANDA. 
    At an artisans' meeting in 1882 he exclaimed against &quot;THE UBIQUITOUS 
    AND DUMBFOUNDING RISE TO PROSPERITY OF THE JEWS,&quot; WHO HAD RISEN TO ALMOST 
    A HEGEMONY IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE...A SYMPTOM OF THE GENERAL ECONOMIC DISEASE. 
    But it soon developed into racial anti-Semitism. In 1883 he wrote...&quot;We 
    shall never be willing to recognize a Jew as a German because he speaks German 
    or even behaves in a German national way, or to aim at a mixture of Germans 
    and Jews, or to consent to it...</b></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/LawOfMoses.gif" width="577" height="438"></p>
  <p align="left"><b>...Adopting the &quot;brutal racial point of view&quot; we 
    must on the contrary declare that we consider much more feasible a mixture, 
    or in certain circumstances an alliance, with the Slavs and Latins than any 
    intimate connection with the Jews.. For the former are Aryans and related 
    to us, while the latter are completely alien to us by descent....If one or 
    the other Jew voluntarily joins our German ranks, he may work with us in God's 
    name, but only as a common soldier and not in a leading position...&quot;</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>In the Reichstrat in 1883 Schonerer demanded the dismissal 
    of all Jewish teachers; all true Germans must must oppose THE INTERNATIONAL 
    SPECULATORS WITHOUT A FATHERLAND, whose goal is the corruption of the German 
    race already at the primary school stage. Four years later he demanded special 
    legislation against the immigration of foreign Jews, for &quot;the customs 
    and ways of life of these alien parasites are hostile to the Aryan descent 
    and to the Christian culture of the German nation.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>It was Schonerer's Germanism...which became extreme during 
    these years, his veneration for things Germanic or Prussian </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(begin 
    to open the pages of the Book of Jeremiah the prophet at this time)</font><b>, 
    his hatred of the Hapsburg monarchy and Catholicism, feelings that were echoed 
    by the German racialists....His paper recommended parents to give to their 
    children truly Germanic names...He tried to revive THE MIDSUMMER AND YULETIDE 
    FESTIVALS, Germanic cults, and the Germanic names of the months...Celebrations 
    were held to commemorate THE BATTLES OF NOREIA , where the Cimbri defeated 
    the Roman legions in 113 BC, and of the Teutonburg forest, where Varus' legions 
    had been slain by the Cherusci in AD 9. In the place of the Christian calendar 
    a Germanic calendar starting in 113 BC was to be introduced; a festival was 
    organized in 1888 to inaugurate the year 2001 STARTING FROM NOREIA...</b></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="+1">While we are here in the region of Noreia let 
    us remind ourselves that we are also back at the hidden center of the ancient 
    Hebrew oracles. The Romans, we have learned, came upon a temple dedicated 
    to Noreia (in the 1st century BC), on Fraunberg, &quot;the Woman's Mountain&quot; 
    in Austria. They merged her with Isis and called her Isis-Noreia. Fittingly 
    the early Gnostics wrote much about her. She was the spiritual personification 
    of that place named Beauty (or Tipheret) in the center of Europe. In addition 
    to the following excerpts from <i>A New Translation of The Gnostic Scriptures, 
    </i>by Bentley Layton, please consider the text entitled The Thought of Norea 
    in <i>The Nag Hammadi Library</i>, edited by James M. Robinson: </font></p>

      Reality of the Rulers, p.72). </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Confrontation of Norea and the Rulers</font></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">But Norea turned to them and said, It is you who are 
      the rulers of the darkness: you are accursed. And you did not know my mother, 
      instead it was your (own) female counterpart that you knew. For I am not 
      your descendant; RATHER, IT IS FROM THE WORLD ABOVE THAT I COME...</font></i></p>

      Gnostic Scriptures. p.73).</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rise of Fascism 
    continued)</font>...<b>Some years later Schonerer launched the &quot;Break 
    with Rome&quot; movement against the anti-German power of Rome, to achieve 
    &quot;the final victory of Germandom over the un-German quarrelsome Roman 
    Church,&quot; which had allied with &quot;Slav insolence...in order to annihilate 
    Germandom in this Empire which has been built on German foundations.&quot; 
    His followers were enjoined to leave the Catholic Church and to become Protestants, 
    but few did so, Others--to prove their anti-Semitic convictions--were wearing 
    on their watch-chain a pendant showing hanged Jews...</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>In 1913 a new party programme was adopted which was...outspoken, 
    especially against the teachings of the Socialist Democratic Party Saint Marx. 
    His doctrine of internationalism was pronounced &quot; wrong and of immeasurable 
    damage to the Germandom of central Europe.&quot; The poor German-speaking 
    workers, &quot;who with their contributions had made Social Democracy powerful, 
    were in many areas pushed out of their jobs by the Slav comrades whom they 
    had heartily welcomed. The German employer took the cheaper Slav worker; but 
    the red organization refused to give the German party veterans the protection 
    to which they were entitled...&quot; HENCE THE GERMANS BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE 
    &quot;THE PERNICIOUSNESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL DOCTRINES&quot; AND &quot;THE 
    INSINCERITY OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY WHICH IS LED BY JEWS AND CLOSELY ALLIED WITH 
    THE MOBILE BIG CAPITALISTS.&quot; What is interesting in this programme is 
    not so much the description of the dangers threatening German workers--which 
    was based on reality--BUT THE CLOSE CONNECTION SEEN BETWEEN JEWS, SOCIAL DEMOCRATS 
    AND BIG CAPITALISTS, which was to figure so prominently in <i>Mein Kampf</i> 
    and in National Socialist propaganda....</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>These political influences shaped the mind of young Adolf 
    Hitler, who was born at Braunau on the Inn in 1889, as the son of an Austrian 
    customs official. When he came to Vienna as a young man of eighteen his political 
    sympathies were with Schonerer and the Pan-Germans. He was impressed with 
    Schonerer's enthusiasm for...his advocacy of joining the German <i>Reich</i>...Last 
    but not least Hitler encountered in Vienna a fierce anti-Semitism preached 
    there by leaders of both parties...&quot;Disgusting to me was the conglomerate 
    of races which characterized the capital of the Empire, disgusting this whole 
    mixture of peoples, of Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, Ruthenians, Serbs and Croats...but 
    between them all as the eternal morbid growth of humanity--Jews and more Jews.&quot;
