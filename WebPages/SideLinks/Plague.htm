  <p>ENDING OUR PLAGUE BEFORE OUR CHILDREN BECOME RATS</p>

  Americans are sick with an intentionally spread disease far more deadly than 
  anthrax. Our Plague has symptoms: constant wars and the dilution of our wealth 
  are the two most deadly. Unlike the bubonic plague of the Middle Ages, our disease 
  is being carefully crafted and cultured by man, some few of whom benefit from 
  it beyond our wildest imagination. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/BushSyndicate.gif" width="500" height="321"></p>
<p>Villages and towns all over Europe were wiped out in the Middle Ages, and families 
  lived in dread. The mystery of how the plague was spread engendered terror. 
  Some tried to run from infected towns; people were murdered for being suspected 
  of causing it; no one wanted to handle the bodies of the dead; some who secluded 
  themselves from others died. &quot;Plague&quot; became a uniquely feared word 
  in our language.</p>
<p> The Plague was carried by fleas that lived on immune rats. When humans got 
  too close to the rats they were bitten by infected fleas and soon died a terrible 
  death, and the rats had more to eat; they were unseen, hiding everywhere. Our 
  plague has two faces and its own special rats Someone is methodically stripping 
  our money of its value. While some elites have more than they can spend, many 
  of us are trapped by rising prices and taxes. We are, it seems, helpless to 
  stop it. Pharisee Watch calls this financial plague &quot;dilution,&quot; because 
  someone is causing our hard-saved dollars to be watered down. </p>
<p>Those who cause dilution prefer to call it &quot;inflation.&quot; Our paychecks, 
  our investments, our savings, and our pensions buy less every year--no, every 
  month--and our debts continue to mount. WHTT's easy to read publication, Gold, 
  the Rediscover Investment, lays the groundwork for a good understanding of what's 
  happening.. War goes hand in hand with dilution. THE PLANNERS OF SERIEL WARS 
  ARE LIKE CHILD MOLESTERS; THEY NEVER STOP; THEY'RE ALWAYS PLOTTING. When the 
  heat is on, they go into hiding, but only temporarily. PLAGUE MAKERS REPEAT 
  THEIR WAR CRIMES AS LONG AS THE PUBLIC DOES NOT REVOLT OVER THE KILLINGS. When 
  no enemy remains standing, they engage in &quot;bully&quot; wars against shamefully 
  weak countries. War is a business they cannot allow to stop. Serial wars are 
  perpetual paydays for them. <br>
  Wars destroy morals </p>
<p>Serial Wars also steal the minds of our children, numbing them to killing, 
  a generation at a time. Wars are teaching them that life is cheap. A recently 
  pirated film clip taken in the cockpit of an Apache helicopter made the rounds 
  of the Internet. Military camera footage caught on open ground in the dark the 
  appalling sights and sounds of two young Americans who had received permission 
  to execute three Iraqi men. In the film you see terrified humans executed one 
  at a time from a great distance with a Gatling cannon designed to destroy tanks. 
  The bodies appear to disintegrate when they are hit. </p>
<p>The callous dialog of the two young Americans, with their sights locking onto 
  the infrared images of humans, should chill your blood. Their words are: &quot;Get 
  him, he's wounded&quot;... &quot;here's the other one... under that truck&quot;... 
  &quot;got him!&quot;... &quot;where did the other one go?&quot; In 15 or 20 
  seconds it was over. I felt a distinct and terrible thumping in my chest. My 
  pulse had increased by half. One who saw it described it as a &quot;pornographic 
  experience.&quot; What do the young executioners feel? </p>
<p>Some have described the &quot;head rush&quot; of killing a wounded Iraqi. They 
  will never forget it. They will someday recall their faces or remember that 
  those three men against whom no fault was proved were only in the wrong time 
  in the wrong place, that their wives are sleeping alone, and that their children 
  are fatherless and may be going without food. <br>
</p>
<p>As the selected enemies of the Plague-makers become successively weaker and 
  the serial wars lose their public popularity, IMPERSONAL, NINTENDO-STYLE MASS 
  KILLING replaces the bloody shoot-outs from foxholes and pillboxes of Korea 
  and the jungle patrols in Vietnam, like the Israelis, who surround and execute 
  from a distance, rarely exposing themselves to risk, and then pat the children's 
  heads for the camera. </p>
<p>War infects our families. It feeds the drug importers and porn industry, collapses 
  sexual morality, fuels the abortion mills and crack houses; job problems and 
  anger are anti-family symptoms of the Plague. Does anyone question the immoral 
  impact of the ten-year long war in Vietnam on two generations of Americans? 
  For those that do not know or remember our books and tapes explain. <br>
  To pay for their wars, the Plague-makers print money and pay it to their allies. 
  This is why your dollars are diluted. To hide rising prices (caused by diluted 
  money) they sign treaties that lower labor costs, forcing emigration of stable 
  jobs. Business goes where labor is cheap and civil responsibility is nil. The 
  war promoters also deliberately discourage industry at home with regulations 
  that don't apply abroad. </p>
<p>We consumers are forced to buy cheap-labor imports, while our neighbors look 
  for work. And when our own job disappears, we replace it with two and with mini-paychecks 
  from our new &quot;service jobs&quot; at Wal-Mart and Denny's. The lower priced, 
  cheap-labor stuff we buy provides the illusion that we are not sick. But the 
  jobs that produced raw materials and created the products are gone. Gone is 
  the blue-collar laborer who worked 30 years for just one company and, amazingly, 
  was able to educate four kids on one income. The service economy is vulnerable, 
  unstable. Rare is the middle class family where mom stays home and the family 
  can afford an annual vacation together. <br>
</p>
<p>The illusion that the Plague does not exist is the cruelest part of the hoax. 
  In order to further hide the cause of the disease, the Plague-makers have purchased 
  control of virtually the entire media&oacute;newspapers, TV and talk radio, 
  most of Hollywood and both political parties. All of these openly campaign to 
  justify more serial war. <br>
</p>
<p>Skull and Bones for President Our next presidential election will likely be 
  a rigged competition between two members of the Yale University Skull and Bones 
  occult club. Both will claim to be &quot;Christians,&quot; because some 85% 
  of all American also make this claim. &quot;Skull and Bones&quot; is a perfect 
  choice of name for Plague-makers. There is no political choice for the voter! 
  The symptoms of disease surround our lives; we're preoccupied with a concoction 
  of unhealthy entertainment that tells us this sick society is the norm. Worst 
  of all, the plague-makers have found a way to influence mega-churches and religious 
  celebrities, helping them establish various degrees of control over some 40-70 
  million salt-of-the-earth Americans. It is from this base of practicing Christian 
  Americans that the political swing vote is maintained. But these many missions 
  are the Achilles heel of the Plague-makers. </p>
<p>How the Plague makers control America: Our disease-carrying fleas are well 
  known to many people: The fleas are the Republicans and Democrats, the media, 
  Hollywood and mega-corporations, the CFR, Wall Street and the Federal Reserve, 
  Zionists wherever they are, and many more. Everyone has their own favorite list 
  of blood feeding fleas, and most are indeed part of the problem; but knowing 
  or being partly right cannot overcome a plague planned by experts. Many have 
  suspected for a long time that someone is feeding on our blood. The 35-year 
  Cold War proved to be a farce when the Soviet Union collapsed, revealing a shell 
  behind a high fence. A new, shooting-war was needed, it seemed, but who was 
  left to fight? Only two possible choices, China and the Mideast remained. The 
  Arab Mideast was elected in 1990. <br>
</p>
<p>The Plague makers chose to make China an ally, and Islam was elected as the 
  war target. How does this author know this? <br>
  In 1992, the Plague-makers published and obscure map, the Central Intelligence 
  Agency (CIA) World Peacekeeping Map, and on it was the locations of future wars, 
  even Bosnia. Your writer bought the map; it called for war on Islamic states. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>The Enablers, the root of the problem: The key to controlling bubonic plague 
  was to reduce the number of rats by gradually cleaning them out. Medical science 
  calls the rats &quot;vectors.&quot; We prefer to call them &quot;enablers.&quot; 
  Enablers do not have the Plague themselves, but facilitate the work of those 
  that do, knowingly or not. &quot;Enablers&quot; are often well-meaning facilitators 
  of something evil. In warmaking, most are easily influenced, made accomplices 
  by their own trust of others. Some few are rats. <br>
