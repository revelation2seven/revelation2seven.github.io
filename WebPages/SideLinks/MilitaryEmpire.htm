  <p><b>THE AMERICAN MILITARY EMPIRE</b></p>
  <p><b>by Chalmers Johnson<br>
    January 15, 2004 <br>
    <br>
    </b></p>
</div>
<p><b>As distinct from other peoples, most Americans do not recognize -- or do 
  not want to recognize -- that the United States dominates the world through 
  its military power. Due to government secrecy, our citizens are often ignorant 
  of the fact that our garrisons encircle the planet. This vast network of American 
  bases on every continent except Antarctica actually constitutes a new form of 
  empire -- an empire of bases with its own geography not likely to be taught 
  in any high school geography class. Without grasping the dimensions of this 
  globe-girdling Baseworld, one can't begin to understand the size and nature 
  of our imperial aspirations or the degree to which a new kind of militarism 
  is undermining our constitutional order. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Our military deploys well over half a million soldiers, spies, technicians, 
  teachers, dependents, and civilian contractors in other nations. To dominate 
  the oceans and seas of the world, we are creating some thirteen naval task forces 
  built around aircraft carriers whose names sum up our martial heritage -- Kitty 
  Hawk, Constellation, Enterprise, John F. Kennedy, Nimitz, Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
  Carl Vinson, Theodore Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, John C. 
  Stennis, Harry S. Truman, and Ronald Reagan. We operate numerous secret bases 
  outside our territory to monitor what the people of the world, including our 
  own citizens, are saying, faxing, or e-mailing to one another. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Our installations abroad bring profits to civilian industries, which design 
  and manufacture weapons for the armed forces or, like the now well-publicized 
  Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root company, a subsidiary of the Halliburton Corporation 
  of Houston, undertake contract services to build and maintain our far-flung 
  outposts. One task of such contractors is to keep uniformed members of the imperium 
  housed in comfortable quarters, well fed, amused, and supplied with enjoyable, 
  affordable vacation facilities. Whole sectors of the American economy have come 
  to rely on the military for sales. On the eve of our second war on Iraq, for 
  example, while the Defense Department was ordering up an extra ration of cruise 
  missiles and depleted-uranium armor-piercing tank shells, it also acquired 273,000 
  bottles of Native Tan sunblock, almost triple its 1999 order and undoubtedly 
  a boon to the supplier, Control Supply Company of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and its subcontractor, 
  Sun Fun Products of Daytona Beach, Florida. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>At Least Seven Hundred Foreign Bases </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>It's not easy to assess the size or exact value of our empire of bases. 
  Official records on these subjects are misleading, although instructive. According 
  to the Defense Department's annual &quot;Base Structure Report&quot; for fiscal 
  year 2003, which itemizes foreign and domestic U.S. military real estate, the 
  Pentagon currently owns or rents 702 overseas bases in about 130 countries and 
  HAS another 6,000 bases in the United States and its territories. Pentagon bureaucrats 
  calculate that it would require at least $113.2 billion to replace just the 
  foreign bases -- surely far too low a figure but still larger than the gross 
  domestic product of most countries -- and an estimated $591,519.8 million to 
  replace all of them. The military high command deploys to our overseas bases 
  some 253,288 uniformed personnel, plus an equal number of dependents and Department 
  of Defense civilian officials, and employs an additional 44,446 locally hired 
  foreigners. The Pentagon claims that these bases contain 44,870 barracks, hangars, 
  hospitals, and other buildings, which it owns, and that it leases 4,844 more. 
  </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>These numbers, although staggeringly large, do not begin to cover all the 
  actual bases we occupy globally. The 2003 Base Status Report fails to mention, 
  for instance, any garrisons in Kosovo -- even though it is the site of the huge 
  Camp Bondsteel, built in 1999 and maintained ever since by Kellogg, Brown &amp; 
  Root. The Report similarly omits bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, 
  Kyrgyzstan, Qatar, and Uzbekistan, although the U.S. military has established 
  colossal base structures throughout the so-called arc of instability in the 
  two-and-a-half years since 9/11. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>For Okinawa, the southernmost island of Japan, which has been an American 
  military colony for the past 58 years, the report deceptively lists only one 
  Marine base, Camp Butler, when in fact Okinawa &quot;hosts&quot; ten Marine 
  Corps bases, including Marine Corps Air Station Futenma occupying 1,186 acres 
  in the center of that modest-sized island's second largest city. (Manhattan's 
  Central Park, by contrast, is only 843 acres.) The Pentagon similarly fails 
  to note all of the $5-billion-worth of military and espionage installations 
  in Britain, which have long been conveniently disguised as Royal Air Force bases. 
  If there were an honest count, the actual size of our military empire would 
  probably top 1,000 different bases in other people's countries, but no one -- 
  possibly not even the Pentagon -- knows the exact number for sure, although 
  it has been distinctly on the rise in recent years. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>For their occupants, these are not unpleasant places to live and work. Military 
  service today, which is voluntary, bears almost no relation to the duties of 
  a soldier during World War II or the Korean or Vietnamese wars. Most chores 
  like laundry, KP (&quot;kitchen police&quot;), mail call, and cleaning latrines 
  have been subcontracted to private military companies like Kellogg, Brown &amp; 
  Root, DynCorp, and the Vinnell Corporation. Fully one-third of the funds recently 
  appropriated for the war in Iraq (about $30 billion), for instance, are going 
  into private American hands for exactly such services. Where possible everything 
  is done to make daily existence seem like a Hollywood version of life at home. 
  According to the Washington Post, in Fallujah, just west of Baghdad, waiters 
  in white shirts, black pants, and black bow ties serve dinner to the officers 
  of the 82nd Airborne Division in their heavily guarded compound, and the first 
  Burger King has already gone up inside the enormous military base we've established 
  at Baghdad International Airport. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Some of these bases are so gigantic they require as many as nine internal 
  bus routes for soldiers and civilian contractors to get around inside the earthen 
  berms and concertina wire. That's the case at Camp Anaconda, headquarters of 
  the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, whose job is to police some 1,500 square 
  miles of Iraq north of Baghdad, from Samarra to Taji. Anaconda occupies 25 square 
  kilometers and will ultimately house as many as 20,000 troops. Despite extensive 
  security precautions, the base has frequently come under mortar attack, notably 
  on the Fourth of July, 2003, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was chatting up our 
  wounded at the local field hospital. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The military prefers bases that resemble small fundamentalist towns in the 
  Bible Belt rather than the big population centers of the United States. For 
  example, even though more than 100,000 women live on our overseas bases -- including 
  women in the services, spouses, and relatives of military personnel -- obtaining 
  an abortion at a local military hospital is prohibited. Since there are some 
  14,000 sexual assaults or attempted sexual assaults each year in the military, 
  women who become pregnant overseas and want an abortion have no choice but to 
  try the local economy, which cannot be either easy or pleasant in Baghdad or 
  other parts of our empire these days. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Our armed missionaries live in a closed-off, self-contained world serviced 
  by its own airline -- the Air Mobility Command, with its fleet of long-range 
  C-17 Globemasters, C-5 Galaxies, C-141 Starlifters, KC-135 Stratotankers, KC-10 
  Extenders, and C-9 Nightingales that link our far-flung outposts from Greenland 
  to Australia. For generals and admirals, the military provides seventy-one Learjets, 
  thirteen Gulfstream IIIs, and seventeen Cessna Citation luxury jets to fly them 
  to such spots as the armed forces' ski and vacation center at Garmisch in the 
  Bavarian Alps or to any of the 234 military golf courses the Pentagon operates 
  worldwide. Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld flies around in his own personal 
  Boeing 757, called a C-32A in the Air Force. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Our &quot;Footprint&quot; on the World </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Of all the insensitive, if graphic, metaphors we've allowed into our vocabulary, 
  none quite equals &quot;footprint&quot; to describe the military impact of our 
  empire. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Richard Myers and senior 
  members of the Senate's Military Construction Subcommittee such as Dianne Feinstein 
  (D-CA) are apparently incapable of completing a sentence without using it. Establishing 
  a more impressive footprint has now become part of the new justification for 
  a major enlargement of our empire -- and an announced repositioning of our bases 
  and forces abroad -- in the wake of our conquest of Iraq. The man in charge 
  of this project is Andy Hoehn, deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy. 
  He and his colleagues are supposed to draw up plans to implement President Bush's 
  preventive war strategy against &quot;rogue states,&quot; &quot;bad guys,&quot; 
  and &quot;evil-doers.&quot; They have identified something they call the &quot;arc 
  of instability,&quot; which is said to run from the Andean region of South America 
  (read: Colombia) through North Africa and then sweeps across the Middle East 
  to the Philippines and Indonesia. This is, of course, more or less identical 
  with what used to be called the Third World -- and perhaps no less crucially 
  it covers the world's key oil reserves. Hoehn contends, &quot;When you overlay 
  our footprint onto that, we don't look particularly well-positioned to deal 
  with the problems we're now going to confront.&quot; </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Once upon a time, you could trace the spread of imperialism by counting 
  up colonies. America's version of the colony is the military base. By following 
  the changing politics of global basing, one can learn much about our ever larger 
  imperial stance and the militarism that grows with it. Militarism and imperialism 
  are Siamese twins joined at the hip. Each thrives off the other. Already highly 
  advanced in our country, they are both on the verge of a quantum leap that will 
  almost surely stretch our military beyond its capabilities, bringing about fiscal 
  insolvency and very possibly doing mortal damage to our republican institutions. 
  The only way this is discussed in our press is via reportage on highly arcane 
  plans for changes in basing policy and the positioning of troops abroad -- and 
  these plans, as reported in the media, cannot be taken at face value. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Marine Brig. Gen. Mastin Robeson, commanding our 1,800 troops occupying 
  the old French Foreign Legion base at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti at the entrance 
  to the Red Sea, claims that in order to put &quot;preventive war&quot; into 
  action, we require a &quot;global presence,&quot; by which he means gaining 
  hegemony over any place that is not already under our thumb. According to the 
  right-wing American Enterprise Institute, the idea is to create &quot;a global 
  cavalry&quot; that can ride in from &quot;frontier stockades&quot; and shoot 
  up the &quot;bad guys&quot; as soon as we get some intelligence on them. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>&quot;Lily Pads&quot; in Australia, Romania, Mali, Algeria . . . </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In order to put our forces close to every hot spot or danger area in this 
  newly discovered arc of instability, the Pentagon has been proposing -- this 
  is usually called &quot;repositioning&quot; -- many new bases, including at 
  least four and perhaps as many as six permanent ones in Iraq. A number of these 
  are already under construction -- at Baghdad International Airport, Tallil air 
  base near Nasariyah, in the western desert near the Syrian border, and at Bashur 
  air field in the Kurdish region of the north. (This does not count the previously 
  mentioned Anaconda, which is currently being called an &quot;operating base,&quot; 
  though it may very well become permanent over time.) In addition, we plan to 
  keep under our control the whole northern quarter of Kuwait -- 1,600 square 
  miles out of Kuwait's 6,900 square miles -- that we now use to resupply our 
  Iraq legions and as a place for Green Zone bureaucrats to relax. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Other countries mentioned as sites for what Colin Powell calls our new &quot;family 
  of bases&quot; include: In the impoverished areas of the &quot;new&quot; Europe 
  -- Romania, Poland, and Bulgaria; in Asia -- Pakistan (where we already have 
  four bases), India, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and even, 
  unbelievably, Vietnam; in North Africa -- Morocco, Tunisia, and especially Algeria 
  (scene of the slaughter of some 100,00 civilians since 1992, when, to quash 
  an election, the military took over, backed by our country and France); and 
  in West Africa -- Senegal, Ghana, Mali, and Sierra Leone (even though it has 
  been torn by civil war since 1991). The models for all these new installations, 
  according to Pentagon sources, are the string of bases we have built around 
  the Persian Gulf in the last two decades in such anti-democratic autocracies 
  as Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Most of these new bases will be what the military, in a switch of metaphors, 
  calls &quot;lily pads&quot; to which our troops could jump like so many well-armed 
  frogs from the homeland, our remaining NATO bases, or bases in the docile satellites 
  of Japan and Britain. To offset the expense involved in such expansion, the 
  Pentagon leaks plans to close many of the huge Cold War military reservations 
  in Germany, South Korea, and perhaps Okinawa as part of Secretary of Defense 
  Rumsfeld's &quot;rationalization&quot; of our armed forces. In the wake of the 
  Iraq victory, the U.S. has already withdrawn virtually all of its forces from 
  Saudi Arabia and Turkey, partially as a way of punishing them for not supporting 
  the war strongly enough. It wants to do the same thing to South Korea, perhaps 
  the most anti-American democracy on Earth today, which would free up the 2nd 
  Infantry Division on the demilitarized zone with North Korea for probable deployment 
  to Iraq, where our forces are significantly overstretched. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In Europe, these plans include giving up several bases in Germany, also 
  in part because of Chancellor Gerhard Schr&ouml;der's domestically popular defiance 
  of Bush over Iraq. But the degree to which we are capable of doing so may prove 
  limited indeed. At the simplest level, the Pentagon's planners do not really 
  seem to grasp just how many buildings the 71,702 soldiers and airmen in Germany 
  alone occupy and how expensive it would be to reposition most of them and build 
  even slightly comparable bases, together with the necessary infrastructure, 
  in former Communist countries like Romania, one of Europe's poorest countries. 
  Lt. Col. Amy Ehmann in Hanau, Germany, has said to the press &quot;There's no 
  place to put these people&quot; in Romania, Bulgaria, or Djibouti, and she predicts 
  that 80% of them will in the end stay in Germany. It's also certain that generals 
  of the high command have no intention of living in backwaters like Constanta, 
  Romania, and will keep the U.S. military headquarters in Stuttgart while holding 
  on to Ramstein Air Force Base, Spangdahlem Air Force Base, and the Grafenw&ouml;hr 
  Training Area. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>One reason why the Pentagon is considering moving out of rich democracies 
  like Germany and South Korea and looks covetously at military dictatorships 
  and poverty-stricken dependencies is to take advantage of what the Pentagon 
  calls their &quot;more permissive environmental regulations.&quot; The Pentagon 
  always imposes on countries in which it deploys our forces so-called Status 
  of Forces Agreements, which usually exempt the United States from cleaning up 
  or paying for the environmental damage it causes. This is a standing grievance 
  in Okinawa, where the American environmental record has been nothing short of 
  abominable. Part of this attitude is simply the desire of the Pentagon to put 
  itself beyond any of the restraints that govern civilian life, an attitude increasingly 
  at play in the &quot;homeland&quot; as well. For example, the 2004 defense authorization 
  bill of $401.3 billion that President Bush signed into law in November 2003 
  exempts the military from abiding by the Endangered Species Act and the Marine 
  Mammal Protection Act. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>While there is every reason to believe that the impulse to create ever more 
  lily pads in the Third World remains unchecked, there are several reasons to 
  doubt that some of the more grandiose plans, for either expansion or downsizing, 
  will ever be put into effect or, if they are, that they will do anything other 
  than make the problem of terrorism worse than it is. For one thing, Russia is 
  opposed to the expansion of U.S. military power on its borders and is already 
  moving to checkmate American basing sorties into places like Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, 
  and Uzbekistan. The first post-Soviet-era Russian airbase in Kyrgyzstan has 
  just been completed forty miles from the U.S. base at Bishkek, and in December 
  2003, the dictator of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, declared that he would not 
  permit a permanent deployment of U.S. forces in his country even though we already 
  have a base there. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>When it comes to downsizing, on the other hand, domestic politics may come 
  into play. By law the Pentagon's Base Realignment and Closing Commission must 
  submit its fifth and final list of domestic bases to be shut down to the White 
  House by September 8, 2005. As an efficiency measure, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld 
  has said he'd like to be rid of at least one-third of domestic Army bases and 
  one-quarter of domestic Air Force bases, which is sure to produce a political 
  firestorm on Capitol Hill. In order to protect their respective states' bases, 
  the two mother hens of the Senate's Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee, 
  Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and Dianne Feinstein, are demanding that the Pentagon 
  close overseas bases first and bring the troops now stationed there home to 
  domestic bases, which could then remain open. Hutchison and Feinstein included 
  in the Military Appropriations Act of 2004 money for an independent commission 
  to investigate and report on overseas bases that are no longer needed. The Bush 
  administration opposed this provision of the Act but it passed anyway and the 
  president signed it into law on November 22, 2003. The Pentagon is probably 
  adept enough to hamstring the commission, but a domestic base-closing furor 
  clearly looms on the horizon. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>By far the greatest defect in the &quot;global cavalry&quot; strategy, however, 
  is that it accentuates Washington's impulse to apply irrelevant military remedies 
  to terrorism. As the prominent British military historian, Correlli Barnett, 
  has observed, the U.S. attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq only increased the threat 
  of al-Qaeda. From 1993 through the 9/11 assaults of 2001, there were five major 
  al-Qaeda attacks worldwide; in the two years since then there have been seventeen 
  such bombings, including the Istanbul suicide assaults on the British consulate 
  and an HSBC Bank. Military operations against terrorists are not the solution. 
  As Barnett puts it, &quot;Rather than kicking down front doors and barging into 
  ancient and complex societies with simple nostrums of 'freedom and democracy,' 
  we need tactics of cunning and subtlety, based on a profound understanding of 
  the people and cultures we are dealing with -- an understanding up till now 
  entirely lacking in the top-level policy-makers in Washington, especially in 
  the Pentagon.&quot; </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In his notorious &quot;long, hard slog&quot; memo on Iraq of October 16, 
  2003, Defense secretary Rumsfeld wrote, &quot;Today, we lack metrics to know 
  if we are winning or losing the global war on terror.&quot; Correlli-Barnett's 
  &quot;metrics&quot; indicate otherwise. But the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; 
  is at best only a small part of the reason for all our military strategizing. 
  The real reason for constructing this new ring of American bases along the equator 
  is to expand our empire and reinforce our military domination of the world.
