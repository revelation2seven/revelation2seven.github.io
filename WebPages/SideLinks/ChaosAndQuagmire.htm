<p align="center">Deaths deal their daily blows to pollyanna Bush </p>
<p align="center">October 14, 2003 </p>
<p>Baghdad: Another United States soldier was killed in northern Iraq as Baghdad 
  nervously prepared to go to work following the death of at least six people 
  in a two-car suicide bombing. The soldier was killed and another wounded when 
  their vehicle struck a landmine near Bayji.</p>
<p>The suicide bombers struck outside the Baghdad Hotel, which is used by members 
  of Iraq's Governing Council and United States contractors. A coalition spokesman 
  denied the hotel was the headquarters for the CIA. But a US officer at the scene, 
  who asked not to be identified, said that US security personnel, contractors 
  and Iraqi Governing Council members lived in the hotel. </p>
<p>The latest attacks dealt a new blow to President George Bush's campaign to 
  claim success in the effort to rebuild Iraq. They have also further eroded Iraqis' 
  trust that the administrators can protect them from daily violence. Dozens of 
  Iraqi civilians have been killed in attacks aimed at the US-led coalition and 
  their allies. </p>
<p>Paul Bremer, the leading US official in Iraq, said: &quot;The terrorists know 
  that the Iraqi people and the coalition are succeeding in the reconstruction 
  of Iraq. They will do anything, including taking the lives of innocent Iraqis, 
  to draw attention away from the extraordinary progress made since liberation 
  . . . The terrorists will not succeed.&quot; </p>
<p>But in Washington, Mr Bush came under renewed pressure from politicians who 
  demanded a clearer plan for securing Iraq and winning international support 
  for rebuilding the country. &quot;We need to go to the United Nations more humbly, 
  more directly, more honestly, solicit help in a way that brings the United Nations 
  into this effort, or you are going to continue to see bomb after bomb after 
  bomb,&quot; said Senator John Kerry, a Democrat. </p>
<p> Ali Abbas, the Iraqi boy who lost both arms and most of his family when a 
  US missile destroyed their home in Baghdad on March 29, has been fitted with 
  artificial limbs at St Mary's Hospital, London, the Daily Mirror reported yesterday. 
  His prosthetic arms were paid for by the Kuwaiti Government.</p>

  Army studying high suicide rate among US soldiers in Iraq </p>
<p align="center">October 14, 2003 </p>
<p>The US army has sent mental health specialists to Iraq to determine why so 
  many soldiers are committing suicide there, a US media report said. Eleven US 
  soldiers and three Marines have killed themselves in the past seven months in 
  Iraq, an annualised rate of 17 suicides per 100,000 soldiers. The usual rate 
  of army suicides is 13 per 100,000 soldiers, the report in the USA Today newspaper 
  said.</p>
<p>A dozen other army deaths being investigated in Iraq could include suicides, 
  and the US Navy is also investigating one possible suicide, it said. &quot;The 
  number of suicides has caused the army to be concerned,&quot; said Lieutenant 
  Colonel Elspeth Cameron Ritchie, an army psychiatrist helping investigate the 
  deaths. &quot;Is there something different going on in Iraq that we really need 
  to pay attention to?&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the suicides have occurred since May 1, when major combat operations 
  were declared over. Depression, harsh and dangerous living conditions, a long 
  deployment and the accessibility of weapons could contribute to the problem, 
  experts said. The army has sent 478 soldiers home from Iraq for mental-health 
  reasons, the daily said.</p>

<p align="center">Almost every day brings news of another US death in Iraq, but 
  we hear almost nothing of the hundreds - maybe thousands - wounded by Saddam 
  loyalists. In a rare visit to an army hospital, Rory McCarthy glimpses the victims 
  of a hidden war</p>
<p>The first they hear of Specialist Brian Wilhelm is an indecipherable crackle 
  over the walkie-talkies. It is an early October afternoon and the Black Hawk 
  pilots and paramedics of the 54th Medical Company, one of the US army's medevac 
  units, are lounging in a small, chilled wooden hut. A camouflage net shades 
  them from the relentless sun and the comforts of Gatorade and chocolate snacks 
  tempt the young soldiers to forget for a moment the bloody trials of postwar 
  Iraq. On a small television the medics are watching re-runs of Scrubs, an US 
  sitcom about overworked junior doctors. The helicopter pilots, with a swagger 
  all their own, are playing Black Hawk Down, a shoot 'em up computer game based 
  on the infamous American military operation in Mogadishu a decade ago which 
  left 18 of their comrades dead. </p>
<p>&quot;First up,&quot; shouts the voice on the radio, calling the priority medevac 
  team to work. A convoy from the army's Eigth Infantry Regiment has come under 
  attack yet again just outside this base at Balad, in the heart of resistance 
  country north of Baghdad. A soldier is down, alive but badly wounded. A smoke 
  flare marks the exact spot by a pontoon over the Tigris river. It's a &quot;hot 
  LZ&quot;, says the voice on the radio: the Iraqis are still shooting. </p>
<p>This is the hidden story of America's military adventure in Iraq. From their 
  heavily barricaded offices in Baghdad, the US army's public relations operation 
  did not announce the attack last week on Wilhelm. It did not describe how the 
  Black Hawk pilots risked their lives to retrieve him and bring him to the emergency 
  room of the 21st Combat Support Hospital at Balad where some of the army's finest 
  nurses, medics and doctors saved his life. It did not describe the pain he is 
  suffering, the agony his family is going through or the fact that Spc Wilhelm 
  will never be a soldier again. </p>
<p>More than 320 US troops have died since America invaded Iraq, but hundreds 
  more have been injured in the line of duty, many so seriously that they will 
  be disabled for life. This is the price the commander-in-chief, George Bush, 
  asked of his troops when, after the fall of Baghdad, he challenged Iraq's many 
  resistance fighters into battle. &quot;Bring them on,&quot; Bush declared on 
  July 2. And on the fighters came, their attacks ever more sophisticated and 
  ever more deadly. According to the military's official count, up to six soldiers 
  are now killed each week in Iraq six months after the fall of Saddam Hussein, 
  and at least another 40 are injured. </p>
<p>The military has never admitted the total number of soldiers injured so far, 
  though the figure appears to run into the thousands. At the combat hospital 
  in Balad, one of a handful of military medical centres in Iraq, a total of 1,088 
  patients were admitted for treatment between May and the end of August. As many 
  as 916 had to be evacuated, although not all suffered combat injuries (soldiers 
  who break their ankles in football games are also sent home to recover.) One 
  report last month said 6,000 US soldiers had already been evacuated home, of 
  whom more than 1,000 were designated &quot;wounded in action&quot; - twice the 
  toll for the first Gulf war. </p>
<p>Six minutes after the first call, the Black Hawk helicopter is in the air, 
  racing just a few hundred feet above the canals and brown fields of Balad towards 
  the smoke flare. At the pontoon, heavy reinforcements in Humvees and armoured 
  personnel carriers have already set up a perimeter. A medic on the ground has 
  bandaged Wilhelm's leg, encased it in a splint and attached a white paper to 
  his flak jacket reporting the injury: &quot;RPG blast to left leg.&quot; </p>
<p>The convoy hit a makeshift bomb in the road and was then hit by a rocket-propelled 
  grenade and rifle fire. Spc Wilhelm lies on the stretcher in pain but still 
  conscious, propping up his head with his right arm, dirt in his fingernails. 
  Blood is starting to seep through the stretcher. </p>
<p>Twenty minutes after the call the helicopter lands back at the base. Specialist 
  Chris Shirley, a cheery ambulance driver with &quot;God Bless America&quot; 
  scribbled on his helmet, helps lift the stretcher off the Black Hawk. Minutes 
  later Wilhelm is lying on trolley five surrounded by doctors and medics inside 
  the emergency room tent. A nurse carefully places his bloodstained flak jacket 
  and uniform into a black plastic bag as the doctors prepare him for surgery. 
  Within just an hour of the first call, the young soldier is already on the operating 
  table. </p>
<p>In the opposite corner of the emergency room tent stand a group of sullen soldiers, 
  among them the patient's company commander, Captain Kevin Ryan, 29. It is the 
  seventh time in recent weeks that Ryan has stood here waiting for news of an 
  injured soldier from his company. Frequently he spends the night by their bedsides, 
  comforting young men trained to believe in their own invincibility, and then 
  returns to his company at dawn to prepare them for another day of patrolling. 
  &quot;It pisses most of them off,&quot; he says. &quot;There is really nothing 
  we can do except try and prevent it the next time. After an incident like this 
  we get everybody involved back together and piece together what happened and 
  see how we can handle it a little better next time.&quot; </p>
<p>The doctors report to him that Wilhelm will live and will probably keep his 
  badly damaged left foot. They cannot quite believe Ryan is back in the hospital. 
  &quot;He has had an inordinately high number of soldiers that have ended up 
  here,&quot; says Colonel Carol McNeill, deputy commander of nursing. &quot;He 
  has brought them through the moment that decides whether they are going to live 
  or die and he has made a difference.&quot; </p>
<p>The problem facing American infantrymen is the resistance fighters' weapon 
  of choice: homemade bombs, known in military parlance as improvised explosive 
  devices (IEDs). They are artillery shells or grenades hidden by the roadside 
  and detonated from the bushes with a command wire as a US convoy passes. The 
  blast forces the convoy to halt and then the fighters open fire. &quot;We return 
  fire but they have got the choice of ground. They get as many shots off as they 
  can and they back off,&quot; Ryan says. Soldiers now stuff sandbags into the 
  flooring of their Humvees for protection from the bombs and otherwise hope today 
  is not the day the medevac is coming for them. </p>
<p>The 21st Combat Support Hospital (motto: &quot;Fear Not&quot;) is a peculiar 
  honeycomb of white, air-conditioned tents built around a corridor that connects 
  the emergency room to a pre-op tent and then to two fully collapsible operating 
  rooms. Spread out on either side are wards for intensive and intermediate care. 
  There are seven surgeons in the unit and a host of other medical staff including 
  a dentist, a psychiatrist, a physiotherapist and even a dietician. Most are 
  on active duty - full-time soldiers put through medical training by the army 
  and taught to handle gruesome combat injuries. Specialist Robert Burrell, 32, 
  a phlegmatic medic with nine years' service in the military, was one of the 
  first to treat the injured infantryman. A photograph of Burrell's two young 
  daughters is among dozens of family snaps pinned up on the wall in the emergency 
  room, next to the incongruous &quot;Peace and Love&quot; posters, a timetable 
  of the five different religious services held each week and a calendar that 
  counts down the unit's time left in country: 158 days to go. </p>
<p>He attends the chapel every Sunday, says grace before each meal, chats regularly 
  with the chaplain and has no truck with the post-traumatic counsellors who suddenly 
  materialise in the hospital after particularly heavy days. &quot;We sure see 
  some ugly stuff in here - guys who come in from the field, bleeding all over 
  and with 15 bullet holes in them,&quot; he says. &quot;We see all the shit that 
  the rest of them don't want to see.&quot; </p>
<p>Others among the medical staff are reservists, Americans who joined up as students 
  to pay their way through $120,000 medical schools and who are now giving back 
  their time to the army. Now they live far from home, work 12-hour shifts and 
  spend part of nearly every night sheltering in the bunker from the regular mortar 
  attacks. Major Gordon Olsen is an orthopaedic specialist who runs a small private 
  practice in Heber City, Utah, where the most serious injuries he sees are riders 
  who have fallen off their horses. &quot;Before I came over, watching the news 
  I was rah-rah and here we go,&quot; he says. &quot;Now I am just thinking, this 
  needs to stop and go away. When talking to my wife at home, you know, people 
  just hear about a few casualties a day and it doesn't sound like a big deal. 
  But when you see a 19-year-old kid with his leg barely hanging on, that one 
  alone is a big deal.&quot; </p>
<p>Yet what most of the medical staff in the hospital find the biggest challenge 
  is not the horrific injuries they see every day but the fact that they must 
  also treat Iraqi prisoners. In one recent case an American soldier died from 
  his injuries, while on the trolley next to him the Iraqi suspected of attacking 
  him was treated for his wounds, operated on several times and eventually pulled 
  through. &quot;There are times when you take these guys in, take care of them 
  and they are going to live and that is really hard,&quot; says Captain Eric 
  Ritter. &quot;I know what these guys have done and you have got to remind yourself 
  they are patients. But every day our guys are out there getting hit.&quot; </p>
<p>There are nine Iraqis recovering in the enemy prisoner-of-war ward, all of 
  whom have been injured by US troops. Two armed military policemen guard the 
  door. Ather, 24, a taxi driver, was shot in the hand in a scuffle after troops 
  found a gun in the back of his car. Doctors at the hospital performed a complicated 
  operation on his hand, which is now held together with several pins. &quot;We 
  didn't do anything wrong. We were just driving to Baghdad and we had a gun in 
  the car to protect ourselves from thieves,&quot; he says. &quot;I was happy 
  that Saddam has gone but I'm not pleased with what has happened to me.&quot; 
  Like all the other patients on this ward, once he has recovered he will be taken 
  in for questioning at a US detention centre, probably at Baghdad airport. </p>
<p>In a ward next door nurses are treating a young Iraqi girl, Aya, six, who suffered 
  severe burns to her back after she fell into a clay oven apparently scared by 
  a low-flying American helicopter. There was little the local hospital in Balad 
  could do for her and her father, Faris Abdullah, is plainly overjoyed that his 
  daughter is being so well treated. But every day outside the base there are 
  long queues of Iraqis desperate for similar treatment. Some of the soldiers 
  even mutter their own private criticism that such Iraqi civilians benefit from 
  their medical care. </p>
<p>The news for Wilhelm is good. After more surgery he will probably be evacuated 
  first to Landstuhl regional medical center in Germany, from where most are sent 
  on to the overcrowded wards of Walter Reed army medical centre in Washington. 
  The doctors tell Ryan to go back to his tent and rest. His soldier won't be 
  out from surgery for a while yet. But Ryan wants to stay and the nurses prepare 
  a bed for him next to Wilhelm in the intensive-care ward. In the quiet after 
  the terrible casualties, there is little encouragement to question the reasons 
  for war. &quot;We are here doing our job. It is part of the risk we take,&quot; 
  he says. &quot;If being in the army was easy, there would be a lot more soldiers 
  around.&quot; </p>
