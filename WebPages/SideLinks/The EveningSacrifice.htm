  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;At the highest level of holiness 
    are those persons who have achieved a state in which their whole personalities 
    and all their actions are inseparably joined to the divine holiness. Of these 
    persons it is said that they have become a 'chariot' for the Shekinah, and 
    like the Chariot, they are totally yielded up to the One who sits in the driver's 
    seat, the Throne of Glory, and they constitute a part of the throne of glory 
    itself, even though they are flesh and blood, men and women like all other 
    men and women.&quot; </font><b>Adin Steinsalz</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><b>&quot;Of all who have sailed the seas of life, none have 
    experienced a range of vicissitude more wide than has fallen to the lot of 
    some among the mystics. Theirs have been the dazzling heights; the lowest 
    depths have also been theirs. Their solitary vessels have been swept into 
    the frozen north, where the ice of great despair has closed about them...and 
    through a long soul's winter they have lain hidden in cold and darkness, some 
    belated swallow in the cleft of a rock.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vaughan</font><b>.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    </font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">road of mysticism has 
    materially been a <i>via dolorosa</i>, and its track is thickly strewn with 
    the bones of unremembered martyrs. Speaking of what he calls the &quot;True 
    Christians,&quot; or the &quot;Invisible Church,&quot; Komensky says: &quot;Human 
    fury attacked some of them shamefully. Bands of tyrants and hangmen, with 
    countless followers, surrounded them. Sometimes powerful kings and whole kingdoms 
    strove unto exhaustion to destroy them. Yet...they stood together, or went 
    their way merrily, pursuing their callings.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Nothing unexpected,&quot; 
    continues Komensky, &quot;can, indeed, befall them; for they count wounds, 
    prison, torture, and death among God's gifts. To live joyfully or dolefully 
    is indifferent to them, except that they consider the former more dangerous, 
    the latter safer. Therefore they delight in their troubles, wounds and stripes...In 
    all things they are so hardy in God;s faith, that if they suffer not somewhat, 
    they imagine that they are idling and losing time...Some who fared not thus 
    envied the others with holy envy, fearing God's wrath if they received no 
    correction, and separation from Christ if they had no cross. Therefore they 
    kissed the rod and stick of God whenever they touched them, and gratefully 
    took his cross upon them.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continuing to describe 
    the &quot;True Christians,&quot; Komensky says: 'Now it is true that the evil 
    world granted them but little rest, and, indeed, did everything it could to 
    spite and mock them; it grinned at them, bit its thumb at them, pelted them, 
    spat at them, tripped them up, and whatever worse things can be imagined. 
    Of this I saw many examples, and I understood that it befell, according to 
    the orders of God the Highest, that those who wish to be good here must wear 
    cap and bells; for the ways of the world bring it with them that what is wisdom 
    before God is to the world sheer folly. I saw, therefore, that many to whom 
    God had granted His noblest gifts had to endure the contempt and derision 
    of the others, often even of those who were nearest to them. Thus...I saw 
    that the godly heeded this not, that they, indeed, gloried therein, that the 
    worldly stopped up their noses before them as before a stench, averted their 
    eyes from them as from something loathsome, scorned them as fools, put them 
    to death as malefactors. For they said that their watchword, by which it was 
    known that they belonged to Christ, was &quot;not to please the world.&quot; 
    They said also that they who know not how to suffer wrongs gaily hath not 
    yet fully the spirit of Christ; thus spake they of these things, and identified 
    each other.'&quot; </font>The Lost Language of Symbolism, by Harold Bayley,
