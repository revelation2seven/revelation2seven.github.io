  &quot;We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have 
  no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great 
  Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that 
  one day we'd be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. 
  And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off...&quot; 
  <br>
  <br>

  Upon hearing the term &quot;serial killer,&quot; the mind's eye tends to conjure 
  gruesome images from Hollywood films. It envisions Norman Bates stabbing furiously 
  while donning female garb, Hannibal Lecter eating human flesh while quoting 
  Carlyle, and Michael Meyers and other masked monsters slaughtering indiscriminately 
  while simply refusing to die. If we are to believe the majority of Hollywood 
  films, serial killers are near-supernatural beasts who have tapped into a malevolent 
  cosmic force, bestowing them with intellectual genius and inhuman physical strength. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The truth about serial killers is far more mundane. A century of observation 
  has enabled experts to create a fairly reliable serial killer &quot;profile&quot;: 
  a large majority are white (84%), heterosexual (86%), male (90%), and typically 
  between the age of 20-30 when beginning their crimes (70%, with another 26% 
  beginning in their teens.) <br>

  <br>
  Perhaps the most disturbing statistical fact is this: 76% of the world's serial 
  killers were born and raised in the United States of America. Our nearest rival 
  is England, with 17%. Bear in mind that the US, while sporting three quarters 
  of all serial killers, has but 6% of the world's population. The same nation 
  that spawned fast-food restaurants, Britney Spears, and monster-truck competitions 
  has also birthed history's most infamous serial murderers...The names of these 
  fiends have been canonized in TV-movies, true-crime books, and even macabre 
  board games and trading cards. <br>
  <br>
  Many have posited explanations for America's strange &quot;title&quot; as the 
  world's leading producer of serial killers. Some have blamed the popular culture 
  and increased availability of pornography (Ted Bundy, hours before his execution, 
  claimed that soft-core porn drove him to kill). Others point to everything from 
  violence in media to the destruction of the nuclear family. Like any pathology, 
  the contributing factors to serial murder are thought to be numerous and complex. 
  However, our extraordinary propensity for breeding these strange monsters may 
  well have a fairly fundamental cause. After all, what is it that makes America 
  unique from every other country on Earth? <br>
  <br>
  The United States is the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world. 21st 
  century Americans are untouched by Third World pandemics of genocide, famine, 
  disease, and tyranny. For this, we should all be grateful. However, contrary 
  to the belief of many, America is anything but Shangri-La. All things considered, 
  our country may be &quot;the best,&quot; but it is far from perfect, and a denial 
  of this fact does not benefit anyone (other than a few elected officials, and 
  the Fox News Channel). <br>
  <br>
  The last several decades have witnessed the manifestation of an increasingly 
  pervasive sickness in US citizens. It comes in many forms, and it is not easily 
  detected or treated. However, it is every bit as real as the most malignant 
  tumor or infectious virus. It has already killed many people whose only &quot;sin&quot; 
  was being born in the wrong country at the wrong time, and it is certain to 
  kill many more. It is a sickness of mind and spirit which enslaves its victim 
  and harms many in the victim's life. This sickness is without precedent in the 
  entire history of civilization. It may not kill as many as the worst plague 
  or greatest war, but neither a vaccine nor a treaty has the power to stop it. 
  This sickness has a name. It is called the &quot;disease of affluence,&quot; 
  and if you are an American in the year 2004, there is virtually no escaping 
  its touch. <br>
  <br>
  A disease of affluence can take many forms. The eating disorders anorexia nervosa 
  and bulimia fall under this title, as nearly all of their victims are middle 
  to upper class, overachieving caucasians in the Western world. According to 
  the Psychiatric Times (www.psychiatrictimes.com), between 1950-1992, there was 
  a &quot;significant increase&quot; in incidence of anorexia in young women. 
  However, the actual increase of incidence, while probably enormous, is impossible 
  to verify, as the illness was not widely recognized by psychiatry until the 
  1970's. Ironically, in that same span of time, another possible disease of affluence 
  - OBESITY - exploded in the United States, with 31 percent of all adults and 
  17 percent of children qualifying as obese, and another 34 percent of adults 
  and 31.5 percent of children qualifying as overweight. (Source: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5216980/) 
  In other words, Americans are now simultaneously more likely to starve themselves 
  AND/OR die from overeating than at any time in our country's history. <br>
  <br>
  On the surface, the problems listed above - serial murder, anorexia, bulimia, 
  obesity - seem unrelated, but in reality, at the core of each illness may be 
  the same root cause. It cannot be an accident that these pathologies exist most 
  abundantly, in fact almost EXCLUSIVELY, in affluent Western countries. <br>
  <br>
  What delineates Americans from the citizens of every other country in the world? 
  Let's begin by examining our wealth. Although America is demarcated into several 
  socio-economic &quot;classes,&quot; the fact is that virtually no one in this 
  country, not even the homeless and destitute, will experience the kind of hunger 
  and hardship that is commonplace for billions of others on planet Earth. Resources 
  exist for the most downtrodden of Americans that are simply not available in 
  other nations. While I recognize the undeniable benefits of our relative collective 
  affluence, we must also acknowledge that our tremendous comfort and privilege 
  entails many negative social consequences. <br>
  <br>
  Our current generation - the so-called Y generation - have generally not spent 
  their youth struggling to help their families keep food on the table and coals 
  in the fire. Their mental focus in life has never been, &quot;How can I help? 
  What can I contribute? What MUST I do to keep myself and my loved ones alive?&quot;, 
  but rather, &quot;What do I want? What will make me happy? When will I receive 
  the things that I think I'm entitled to?&quot; Kids in America today are programmed 
  to feel entitled to things that are unattainable. Sitting catatonic in front 
  of the TV, American children engage in the most satanic form of idolatry imaginable, 
  worshipping pop singers, professional athletes and movie stars, believing that 
  they must achieve fame and fortune in order for their lives to have meaning. 
  A child who has never had to work, never performed service, and is fed continuous 
  and rancid lies about the nature of &quot;happiness&quot; is the perfect incubator 
  for a disease of affluence. <br>
  <br>
  I think that the greatest tragedy of our collective affluence has been the inevitable 
  loss of human connectedness, or COMMUNITY, which can only exist when individuals 
  recognize their intrinsic dependence on one another. While most Americans are 
  able to physically survive without assistance from neighbors and friends, our 
  spiritual NEED for community and support is just as real. Increasingly in America, 
  we see the phenomena of individuals withdrawing inward into dark and isolated 
  fantasy worlds - or what can be called &quot;living inside your head.&quot; 
  This is a neurotic, narcissistic, spiritually contracted state that exists almost 
  exclusively in the minds of Westerners, particularly Americans. It is the mental 
  state of anorexics, bulimics, addicts of every sort, and even serial murderers. 
  <br>
  <br>
  A person who is focused only on physical survival does not have the &quot;luxury&quot; 
  of living inside his head. He does not think to ask himself, &quot;What do I 
  want? What would feel good and exciting? What will make me happy?&quot; Up until 
  very recently in our history, humans did not go through life worrying over careers 
  and lofty ambitions. This is a new phenomena, and the resulting neuroses are 
  not yet fully understood. Psychologists are having a hard-time keeping up with 
  the new and continuously proliferating mental illnesses that virtually DID NOT 
  EXIST until the late-20th century in America. Therapists are now even treating 
  grown men whose entire lives are centered on the outcome of professional sporting 
  events. Again, these are diseases of affluence, the victims trapped in mental 
  prisons of their own making. A child born in 21st century America may never 
  know the pain of famine or slavery. But in the place of physical suffering is 
  a spiritual anemia that cannot be remedied by material wealth. Make no mistake, 
  we are in a war for our very souls. Our children must be taught to remain diligent 
  and alert when traversing the battlefield they will find themselves stumbling 
  through. <br>
  <br>
  When I look at America, I see many beautiful things, and I do not think I have 
  ever wished that I was born in a different country. I have learned to take the 
  good with the bad, the sweet with the sour. I can accept the inevitable depravity 
  and degradation that comes with a FREE society, because I believe that freedom 
  is preferable. But rest assured, when I wake up in the morning, I am aware of 
  the pitfalls and landmines that await around every corner. I make it through 
  my days joyous and unscathed only because I am ready for WAR. <br>

  Comment to Spiritual Warfare In <br>
  21st Century America <br>
  <br>
  From Zeph Daniel <br>
  zed7@earthlink.net <br>
  7-7-4 <br>
  <br>
  First of all, I agree with many of Mr. Goodspeed's comments, but he does not 
  describe or tell us what the spiritual battle actually is. It is not simply 
  a struggle against immoral behavior, though this is certainly a part of it. 
  A spiritual battle connotes a soul... i.e. we battle for our souls. This term 
  'soul' is not a euphemism--the soul is a literal thing. Remember those 21 grams 
  that disappear upon the death of the human body? The soul is won or lost through 
  free will. <br>
  <br>
  Watching out for moral pitfalls, while this is a worthy pursuit, cannot deliver 
  us from evil, as Evil is a gamesman. Being &quot;moral&quot; or outwardly upright 
  can and often does lead to the sin of pride, which is just as wicked as any 
  other form of depravity. From the sin of pride we become judgmental or elitist, 
  legalistic and dogmatic. <br>
  <br>
  I believe that all men, regardless of the country of origin, are born in captivity. 
  All men will experience pain, sickness and death--along with unrelenting challenges 
  that will occupy much of their time while they are dying. This is not freedom, 
  in America or anywhere else. Worshiping the almighty dollar while trying to 
  remain moral is not possible without the mental trick called DENIAL. <br>
  <br>
  The deception in America is that she is a free country. Freedom, by what standard? 
  Private property ownership? Free-markets? Free-speech? Free from governmental 
  tyranny? True, humans in America can worship whatever god they choose... so 
  long as they conform to the 501c3 regulations, so long as they comply with tax-law 
  and other laws applicable. <br>
  <br>
  American isn't free, she's prosperous! The most prosperous and the most deadly 
  nation upon the earth. I did like Mr. Goodspeed's talk of serial killers born 
  and bred in America... check also the global porn industry, headquartered in 
  California's San Fernando Valley. Also the Federal Reserve, headquartered in 
  New York, one of the greatest scams against freedom. Check out the IRS, the 
  AMA, the Patriot Act 1 and 2 and 3 and who knows how far it's going to go. Check 
  out the lack of truth in reporting 911, Waco, Ruby Ridge, OK City, Flight 800, 
  etc. etc. etc. I mention these, but you could also mention Viet Nam, Korea, 
  WW2, the upcoming planned WW3, all hatched in America. And when we say prosperous, 
  we mean both spouses working more than 40 hours a week each, and working far 
  past any retirement age... we mean a people so far in debt that if anything 
  were to suddenly go wrong with the economy, projects and work-camps would be 
  the only solution available, especially as they are repealing the current bankruptcy 
  laws for individuals (and not for corporations, I might add). <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  No one upon the earth is born free. True freedom is overcoming the limitation 
  of death. One can be free in a prison or a communist country, and one can be 
  a slave in a nation as wealthy as America. Wealth does not equal freedom. Wealth 
  without true spiritual teaching leads to decadence and the destruction of the 
  nation. <br>
  <br>
  For me though, 'freedom' is a spiritual term, as we can only be set free by 
  our Creator who made us. Man is weak, and without the grace of the Almighty, 
  a Person Who Is Strong, we will die ignorant, never having lived. Freedom means 
  the freedom to die. How many are ready to die today? Many? A few? Death is not 
  an end, but a beginning, a doorway, and only through the Spirit of God can we 
  see and draw comfort from this reality. <br>
  <br>
  Now, all humans are inherently depraved, and the flesh is basically wicked... 
  we must control our lusts and cravings or become the next monster. No one escapes 
  the lust of the flesh and the pride of life. <br>
  <br>
  In our Holy Scriptures, the Bible, God tells us that we have inherited this 
  condition through His honoring of human free-will. Thus, the free-will choices 
  humans make will either lead to liberation of the generations, or enslavement. 
  You can choose to enslave yourself, for example, in the pursuit of wealth...then 
  live in denial that it does not become the controller. God is clear in His Word, 
  that He will not tolerate idolatry...the Royal Law states that He will not tolerate 
  other gods. I believe that his Royal Law (the 10 Commandments) are a key as 
  to how he thinks. It matters little what we think of His Word... I believe this 
  is a kind of instruction manual. People I know who have pursued life-long dreams 
  and fulfilled them are pretty much all miserable. What we fancy, God takes away. 
  Once a dream is fulfilled, there is emptiness. It cannot hold us, it cannot 
  overcome our sad reality as humans in limitation. Or slavery. <br>
  <br>
  America is enslaved to the ideal of working for prosperity, and remaining ignorant 
  of what the true spiritual battle is... over souls. Can a man lose his soul 
  and gain the whole world, as stated in the Book of Matthew 16:26? Indeed, is 
  there a temptation to sell one's soul for prosperity, social acceptance, a happy 
  life? <br>
  <br>
  I contend that nothing is worth selling out for. And this is because, after 
  observing so many humans who have achieved success through this method, none 
  of them ever felt they deserved it--deep down, they feel as if they cheated. 
  At any rate, this is the main battle. It's all a game to get your soul--and 
  America is no different than Haiti or Bombay, or Chili or Russia when it comes 
  to this battle. It is a universal reality, and few churches or religious systems 
  teach children how to stay on that road to freedom. I contend that a person 
  cannot be free until he submits to God and surrenders his free will, then follows 
  Him. <br>
  <br>
  I thank you Jeff Rense for putting up Michael Goodspeed's article, as we can 
  never talk about this subject enough. We have many blessings in America, the 
  biggest one being the opportunity to change course. <br>
