<p align="center">The Dilemma Over Sharing What&#146;s Sacred </p>

  Lynn Case sought a path to spiritual enlightenment that led her, unpredictably, 
  into the bed of a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man.The man&#146;s wife pleaded 
  with the New York woman to sleep with him to &#147;transfer energy&#148; to 
  the medicine man for the sake of the couple&#146;s children. &#147;I believed 
  everything she told me, that one of her kids was going to get hurt,&#148; Case 
  said. &#147;She was crying and holding my hand. I was `all right, all right, 
  all right.&#146; I met her kids. I know her kids.&#148; It was supposed to be 
  a one-time, behind-closed-doors encounter. But two months later, the man&#146;s 
  wife asked Case to repeat the act. She said no. </p>
<p>Last April, Case &#150;who asked to be identified by her maiden name &#150; 
  left the Wisconsin couple&#146;s group of non-Native followers. Unsure of what 
  to do with the pipe she had carved for prayer, she gave it to Arvol Looking 
  Horse, a Lakota spiritual leader from South Dakota&#146;s Cheyenne River Sioux 
  Reservation. </p>
<p>&#147;As I learned of this woman&#146;s story last summer, it made me realize 
  that something needed to be done,&#148; Looking Horse said. &#147;It makes my 
  heart heavy to know just how bad these sacred boundaries were crossed.&#148; 
</p>
<p>That crossing of boundaries has kindled a new sense of urgency among Native 
  people seeking to regain control of their ceremonies. Spiritual leaders are 
  meeting today at the sacred site of Bear Butte in South Dakota in an attempt 
  to stem what they see as the exploitation of Native ceremonies. </p>
<p>Reports abound of abuses that include molestation, money for prayers, drug 
  use and even death during such ceremonies. Many feel Native spiritual leaders 
  and non-Native practitioners have corrupted A SPIRITUAL WAY OF LIFE ONCE CENTRAL 
  TO TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. Past attempts at seclusion &#150; a proposal to ban non-Natives 
  from sacred ceremonies was brought before South Dakota&#146;s Pine Ridge Tribal 
  Council in 1997 &#150; have been futile. But in March, Looking Horse, who represents 
  his family as the 19th-generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe, 
  issued a directive attempting to keep non-Natives from Lakota prayer altars. 
  &#147;If the non-Natives truly understand this purpose, they will ... know that 
  by their departure from this Ho-c&#146;o-ka &#150; our sacred altar &#150; is 
  their sincere contribution to the survival of our future generations.&#148; 
</p>
<p>Lakota altars are found in such ceremonies as the sweat lodge, Sun Dance and 
  Vision Quest. THUS , NON-NATIVES COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN A SUN DANCE BECAUSE 
  DANCERS MUST &quot;GO TO THE TREE,&quot; THE ALTAR AND CENTER OF SUN DANCE ACTIVITY. 
</p>
<p>Looking Horse&#146;s statement evoked spirited rounds of approval from those 
  who believe the Creator gave Native people a way of life &#150; AND IT BELONGS 
  TO THEM ONLY. </p>
<p>But it also brought harsh criticism from non-Natives, and from spiritual leaders 
  who minister to them. A Lakota family from South Dakota&#146;s Rosebud Reservation 
  equated the directive to &#147;ceremonial warfare.&#148; </p>
<p>&#145;We need to protect it&#146; </p>
<p>It wasn&#146;t always like this. But it was predicted. </p>
<p>Frank Good Lance, a Lakota elder, predicted the day when medicine men and women 
  would be as plentiful as the grass, plants and trees. &#147;He said they are 
  going to pray with these ways, and that they are going to sell these ways,&#148; 
  Lakota Medicine Man Roger Byrd told the Native Voice newspaper. That day is 
  here, Byrd said. </p>
<p>And so are many problems. Spiritual practices once meant to strengthen people 
  can also kill them. In July, a 57-year-old Native from Kansas died in a pasture 
  during a Vision Quest &#150; a solitary, two- to four-day fast &#150; on Nebraska&#146;s 
  Santee Reservation. </p>
<p>But it&#146;s the Sun Dance, the most sacred ceremony of Great Plains tribes, 
  that has garnered the most attention. The life-renewal ceremony includes four 
  days of prayer, fasting and dancing Sun Dance participation has reached a &#147;ridiculous 
  proportion,&#148; said Bernard Red Cherries, a Northern Cheyenne Sun Dance chief. 
  &#147;They&#146;re having Sun Dances in Nevada, California, places it doesn&#146;t 
  belong.&#148; </p>
<p>He estimates 300 Sun Dances occur each summer in the United States; Europe 
  also has a growing number. About 240 Sun Dances are of Lakota origin, and nearly 
  one-third of U.S. Sun Dances take place in South Dakota. At last count, 56 occurred 
  on the Pine Ridge Reservation, 40 on the adjacent Rosebud. &#147;It&#146;s at 
  the point now where we need to protect it,&#148; Red Cherries said. </p>
<p>Last October, he called for a meeting of Lakota, Dakota, Nakota, Cheyenne and 
  Arapaho Sun Dance chiefs and medicine bundlekeepers. Another meeting led the 
  group in March to Eagle Butte, S.D., in what was described as a contentious 
  yet historic gathering. That meeting led to this weekend&#146;s meeting in Bear 
  Butte. </p>
<p>Non-Natives no longer welcome </p>
<p>Looking Horse&#146;s position as keeper of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota nations&#146; 
  most sacred medicine bundle prompted others to let him take a lead role after 
  the Eagle Butte meeting. That&#146;s when he released the statement proclaiming 
  non-Natives no longer welcome at the altar of traditional ceremonies. &#147;Our 
  purpose for the Sun Dance is for the survival of the future generations ... 
  first and foremost,&#148; Looking Horse said. He asked non-Natives &#147;to 
  understand and respect our decision. If there have been any unfinished commitments 
  to the Sun Dance and non-Natives have concern for this decision, they must understand 
  that we have been guided through prayer to reach this resolution.&#148; </p>
<p>Martin Marty, a University of Chicago Divinity School emeritus religion professor, 
  said it&#146;s a matter of respecting another&#146;s beliefs. &#147;I&#146;m 
  all with the Native American who rises up and says, `You&#146;re seizing what&#146;s 
  sacred for us and you&#146;re profaning it,&#146;&#148; he said. &#147;When 
  it&#146;s clearly offensive to the majority of people, it comes across more 
  as a parody, a desacrilization, a profaning.&#148; </p>
<p>But Marty also suggests people not close the door of prayer and ritual to others. 
  &#147;I think absolutism from both sides misses the opportunity for us to empathize, 
  to educate, to imagine the life of the other. If we want to do better to each 
  other, we have to know more about each other, we have to care more. </p>
<p>&#147;KEEP SECRET WHAT'S SACRED,&#148; HE SAID. &#147;The outsider can&#146;t 
  always define exactly what that should be. But the more the keeper of the sacred 
  &#150; of any tribe, denomination or whatever &#150; realizes the value of sharing 
  hospitality, the better off we are.&#148; But many Native people say the commercialization 
  and parodies are here, set deep, and out of control. And as summer Sun Dance 
  season gets underway, Looking Horse&#146;s words calling for the ban of non-Natives 
  in significant ceremonial roles has created a stir of spiritual unrest far beyond 
  the borders of Lakota territory. </p>
<p><br>
  Paying for prayers </p>
<p>Each year, hundreds of non-Natives from across the country and Europe arrive 
  at Sun Dance camps. Many reportedly pay hundreds to thousands of dollars &#150;much-needed 
  money on reservations where unemployment rates can reach 80 percent. &#147;It&#146;s 
  really sad to see how much influence these New Agers have on our culture,&#148; 
  said Frank King III, Native Voice editor and a Sicangu Lakota who grew up on 
  the Rosebud Reservation. &#147;It&#146;s the money these white people provide 
  to these medicine men.&#148; </p>
<p>Even the Internet has become a point of sale. Gilbert Walking Bull, a Lakota 
  who lives in Hot Springs, S.D., and his non-Native wife, Diane Marie, sell CDs 
  of ceremonial songs on their Web site, targeting what appears to be a non-Native 
  audience. &#147;We have a place where people can come to camp and relax and 
  they can choose to participate in the (sweat lodge),&#148; Marie said. &#147;What 
  we do here is invite people who have been working with Gilbert to expand their 
  teachings.&#148; </p>
<p>Native spiritual teachings are what drew Case, the New York woman, to follow 
  a Lakota belief system. She described the ways as &#147;beautiful.&#148; But 
  some of her medicine man&#146;s nearly two dozen followers began to feel something 
  wasn&#146;t right, Case said. He visited New York about every three months during 
  the two years she knew him. He and his wife would stay for a week or two, performing 
  several ceremonies a day. &#147;Hundreds of dollars would cross hands,&#148; 
  Case said. &#147;They left there one time with a car. They had enough money 
  to buy a car and bring it home.&#148; Case spent $400 to $500 on a typical ceremony, 
  she said. &#147;Basically we supported the guy and his family. We gave them 
  everything we had.&#148; </p>
<p>In more traditional days, medicine men didn&#146;t have jobs. They worked for 
  the community, and the community took care of them. But many say the tradition 
  has been corrupted, that medicine men seem a dime a dozen. &#147;After `Dances 
  with Wolves,&#146; everybody was a medicine man,&#148; said King, who attended 
  the medicine bundlekeepers meeting in Eagle Butte. &#147;All the Indians, every 
  Indian out here, was some type of spiritual leader.&#148; And while some take 
  their show on the road, many have followers who flock to Rosebud and Pine Ridge. 
</p>
<p>King said he has watched hundreds of non-Natives arrive in South Dakota each 
  summer to participate in Lakota ceremonies. Some, he said, run like assembly 
  lines, with families starting a new Sun Dance as soon as they finish with a 
  group of non-Natives. It&#146;s a mighty shift from the 1882 Bureau of Indian 
  Affairs directive banning Native people from participating in &#147;heathenish 
  dances.&#148; </p>
<p>Back then, tribes took their ceremonies underground. Non-Native participation 
  was unheard of. But now many non-Natives run ceremonies themselves and even 
  carry a sacred pipe, or chanupa &#150; a gift given to the Lakota, Dakota and 
  Nakota nations by the holy White Buffalo Calf Woman. They&#146;re welcomed by 
  some spiritual leaders, who say the colors of the four directions represent 
  the four races of man &#150; red, yellow, black and white. </p>
<p>Others dismiss that notion.&#147;When this pipe was brought to us, they never 
  said the colors represented the four races of people,&#148; said Byrd, the Lakota 
  medicine man. &#147;They didn&#146;t tell us anything about white people. In 
  fact, later on, the spirits did tell us (non-Natives) couldn&#146;t touch the 
  pipe because they have blood on their hands. &#147;One, they killed their own 
  god. And two, it was their ancestors that wiped out hundreds of Native people,&#148; 
  Byrd said. </p>
<p>A return to `segregation&#146; </p>
<p>Looking Horse speaks of the storm swirling above spiritual teachers and believers. 
  &#147;The ones who are abusing our ways are pretty upset about it,&#148; he 
  said. &#147;That doesn&#146;t surprise me. But the traditional people who are 
  using the protocols are very happy that we finally took a stand because it&#146;s 
  gone way too far.&#148; After his statement, Pine Ridge residents displayed 
  support for his stance. Those who called KILI Radio felt the proclamation was 
  overdue. </p>
<p>But it&#146;s not over. </p>
<p>&#147;Now, it looks like this is going to be a ceremonial warfare among the 
  world of the believers of the sacred divine fire,&#148; Leonard Alden Crow Dog, 
  who hails from a family of powerful medicine men, told the Native Voice. &#147;Relatives, 
  think. We are going to go back to that segregation of our people in the &#145;50s 
  and &#145;60s,&#148; he said. </p>
<p>And while Lakota struggle with self-policing their ceremonies, Red Cherries 
  of the Northern Cheyenne is trying to catch the attention of lawmakers. &#147;I&#146;m 
  not going to quit,&#148; he said. &#147;This way belonged to my grandfathers. 
  And I&#146;m going to protect it with my life.&#148; He has traveled to Washington 
  several times in search of legislative backing. Now he is asking federal agencies 
  to help enforce the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978. The act mandates 
  that local, state and federal officials consult with tribes &#147;and review 
  policies to protect properties of our religious way of life,&#148; Red Cherries 
  said. &#147;That has not happened. That&#146;s why all these white guys can 
  ask for a sweat lodge permit and get it.&#148; </p>
<p>Suzan Harjo, executive director of the Morning Star Institute, a Native advocacy 
  organization in Washington, has helped Red Cherries, but said legislation can 
  only do so much. &#147;Now we have to raise the awareness of the public that 
  there&#146;s a problem out there,&#148; she said. </p>
<p>As for Looking Horse, he asks for others to join in prayer, and to respect 
  the Lakota ways. &#147;There&#146;s so much sickness going on in the world,&#148; 
  he said. &#147;We need all nations&#146; prayer to bring healing back to Mother 
  Earth. But we still have to maintain our ceremonies strong, to help bring healing 
  back. If we don&#146;t do this, the spirits will leave our ceremonies. &#147;We 
  surely don&#146;t want that.&#148; </p>
<p>Case, the New York woman who ended up in bed with her medicine man, went through 
  withdrawal after returning her prayer pipe to Looking Horse. &#147;It was horrible. 
  I missed ceremony so bad,&#148;she said. &#147;But if Iwant to pray, I just 
  come in my room and pray, OR I JUST PRAY ANYWHERE. I FEEL STRONGER THAT WAY.</p>
