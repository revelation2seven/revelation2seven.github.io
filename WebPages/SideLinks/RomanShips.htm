<p>It is now confirmed that a Roman ship reached Brazil around the year 19 B.C.! 
  Here is the whole story .</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, the most valuable commodity &quot;known to man&quot; 
  was salt. This is because most fresh meats and fish were preserved by packing 
  in salt. In fact, salt was so valuable, it was used in place of coinage. This 
  is where the word &quot;salary&quot; emerged (as well as the expression &quot;he's 
  not worth his salt&quot;). The Romans had a large salt production facility on 
  Ilha do Sal (Salt Island) in the Cape Verde Islands, which are 350 miles off 
  the coast of West Africa. This location is directly in the path of the hot, 
  dry winds of the Sahara Desert, which can easily blow 60 knots from the east. 
  It is believed that this Roman merchant vessel was heading for Salt Island to 
  pick up a load of salt and to provision the local army garrison when a fierce 
  Sahara storm started. Roman ships were clumsy by modem standards and would have 
  no choice but to lower their sails and to run with the winds to avoid capsizing. 
  The Sahara winds can blow for many days and the Salt Ship was carried to Guanabara 
  Bay (near Rio de Janeiro) in Brazil. In the middle of the - Bay is a large submerged 
  rock lying 3' below the surface called Xareu Rock (named after a local fish 
  that congregates here). The ship appears to have been travelling at a high rate 
  of speed when she struck the rock. She broke into two pieces and settled in 
  75' of water near the base of the rock.</p>
<p>In the late 1970's, a local fisherman using nets around Xareu Rock kept &quot;catching&quot; 
  some large (3' tall), heavy earthen jars which tor his nets. He mistakenly thought 
  these were &quot;macumba&quot;jars, which are used in local voodoo ceremonies 
  and then thrown into the sea. So, as the jars were hauled up, he smashed them 
  with a hammer and threw the small pieces back into the water in an attempt to 
  prevent tearing his nets in the future. If he had only known what treasures 
  he was destroying! In recent years, a scuba diver was spear fishing around Xareu 
  Rock and found eight similar jars that he took home. He sold six jars to tourists 
  before the Brazilian police arrested him with the two remaining jars for illegally 
  selling ancient artifacts. Archaeologists immediately identified these as Roman 
  amphorae of the 1st century B.C These containers were originally used to carry 
  water, grain, salted fish, meat, olives, olive oil and other foods necessary 
  to feed the ship's crew and to provision Roman outposts. One of the world's 
  foremost authorities on Roman shipwrecks, Robert Marx, found more artifacts 
  and confirmed this as an authentic Roman shipwreck. The world's foremost authority 
  on Roman amphorae analyzed the clay in `the jars and confirmed that these were 
  manufactured at Kouass which was a Roman seaport, 2000 years ago, on the coast 
  of modem-day Morocco. The Institute of Archaeology of the University of London 
  performed thermo luminescence testing (which is a more accurate dating process 
  than Carbon 14 dating) and the date of the manufacture was determined to be 
  around 19 B.C. Many more amphorae and some marble objects were recovered, as 
  well as a Roman bronze fibula (a clasp device used to fasten a coat or shirt). 
  This shipwreck may help explain some other intriguing Brazilian finds: - Several 
  hundred ancient Roman silver and bronze coins were unearthed near Recife, Brazil. 
  Did these once belong to the castaways of the Salt Ship?<br>
</p>
<p>A tribe of white, mostly blonde haired, blue-eyed &quot;Indians&quot; has been 
  found in a remote region of the Amazon jungle. Could these be the descendants 
  of the shipwrecked sailors of the Xareu wreck? DNA analysis of these &quot;Indians&quot; 
  will surely bring some interesting facts to light!</p>
