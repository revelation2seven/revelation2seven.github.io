<p align="center"> THE DISAPPEARENCE OF THE JEWISH FOLLOWERS OF JESUS</p>
<p> As the years after the Bar Cochba revolt passed, and it became apparent that 
  the various sectarian groups, including the Evyonim, would no longer be a threat 
  to the Jewish people, the general attitude towards them seemed to soften. This 
  does not mean that they were whole-heartedly accepted by the Jewish people, 
  and certainly no Jew would intermarry with them, but it did mean that Jews could 
  afford to relax more in their presence, and even engage in civil discussion 
  with them despite the Rabbinical injunction to the contrary.</p>
<p> Given all of the preceding, there is an astounding story found in Tractate 
  Chullin 87a, concerning Rabbi Judah the &quot;Great One of his age who lived 
  in the third century and compiled the Mishnah. A certain sectarian (Evyon) came 
  to see Rabbi Judah as he was about to sit down to meal. &quot;Rabbi (Judah) 
  said to him, 'Will you dine with me?' (The Evyon) said, 'Yes'. After they had 
  eaten and drunk, (Rabbi) said to him, 'Will you drink the cup of blessing?' 
  (The Evyon) said, I WILL drink the cup of blessing'&quot;. The fact that this 
  incident took place in the second century, after the Bar Cochba revolt when 
  Jews certainly had nothing to do with sectarians, and that Rabbi Judah asked 
  the Evyon to be part of a MIZUMAN (quarum of three men to say the grace after 
  meals) shows that even at that time, some Jews STILL considered the Evyonim 
  to be Jewish.</p>
<p> Still another story that demonstrates that occaisionally Jews and Evyonim 
  would soften their stance regarding each other is that found in the midrashic 
  work, Bereshit Rabba 82, in which an Evyon came to ask Rabbis Yannai and Jonathan 
  (3rd century) for help in interpreting a Biblical verse. That an Evyon should 
  ask a Rabbi about a Biblical interpretation is astounding. These are not isolated 
  incidents. The Talmud records various other incidents in which Jews held religious 
  &quot;dialogues&quot; with the Evyonim, something they had prohibited to themsleves. 
  Apparently to legislate is one thing, and human interaction in real life is 
  another.</p>
<p> How very true this is is shown by a story found in Tractate Avodah Zarah 4a, 
  which occured in the late third century - early fourth<br>
  century. A certain rabbi, Abahu by name, was approached by the Evyonim and asked 
  to recommend to them a teacher of scripture (!!!). He recommended Rabbi Safra, 
  a famous sage from Babylon. After spending some time with the Evyonim, they 
  fired him because he was unable to satisfactorily explain certain verses to 
  them. When they complained to Rabbi Abahu about his recommendation of Rabbi 
  Safra, he said to them, &quot;I told you that he was great in the Oral Tradition; 
  I did not say he was<br>
  great in the written scriptures.&quot; Aside from the fact that Abahu was asked 
  to recommend a Bible instructor and delivered a Talmudist, we are non-plused, 
  after hearing how Jews and Evyonim were such enemies, to see<br>
  this interchange between them. This incident took place in the city of<br>
  Caesarea, and it is believed by some that the Evyonim held some high<br>
  position there, and posssibly the Jews living there were beholden to<br>
  them for some favor or other, and therefore both groups were forced to<br>
  have some interaction with each other. But even so, one would think that<br>
  whatever interaction they were forced to have with each other, that each<br>
  group would want to avoid a RELIGIOUS interaction with the other.<br>
  Nevertheless the story stands. A suggestion has been offered that since<br>
  Safra came from Babylon, a place where he would never have encountered<br>
  any Jewish believers in Jesus, he was not so sensitive to a mutual<br>
  animosity with them. But then how can the recommendation of Rabbi Abahu<br>
  be explained?</p>
<p> Rabbi Abahu himself had his own confrontation with the Evyonim,<br>
  according to a story in Bereshit Rabba 25:1. In that story, the Jewish<br>
  believers in Jesus point out that the patriarch Enoch never died but was<br>
  taken by G-d. This is done to back up their claim that Jesus never died<br>
  after his resurrection but was taken up bodily by Heaven. Abahu refutes<br>
  this argument by use of a hermeneutic principle in Judaism known as<br>
  GEZERAH SHAVAH, that the verb &quot;to take&quot; is used elsewhere in the Bible<br>
  to indicate death, not ascension.</p>
<p> In all of these stores, it is instructive to note that Jews and<br>
  Evyonim never seem to argue about hallachah or ritual observance. All of<br>
  the arguments and disagreements are over THE INTERPRETATION OF<br>
  SCRIPTURE. This is understandable when we consider that, as Jews, the<br>
  Evyonim never doubted the ongoing legitimacy of hallachah and<br>
  observance. Only when it came to Biblical interpretation, did the<br>
  Evyonim's attitude reflect that of their gentile counterpart believers<br>
  in Jesus' attitude, since Biblical interpretation became the foundation<br>
  of the &quot;proof&quot; of Jesus's messiahship. As to their Torah observance,<br>
  Resh Lakish, the prominent rabbi of his generation (ca. 250), said that<br>
  the so-called POSHEI YISRAEL, literally the &quot;sinners in Israel&quot;, were<br>
  full of good works (Tractate Eruvin 19a). POSHEI YISRAEL is an<br>
  expression often used by the Talmud when referring to Jewish believers<br>
  in Jesus.</p>
<p> But all of this may be explained as follows. During the earlier<br>
  time of the second century, there had been a morbid curiosity about the<br>
  traditions concerning Jesus and his followers as seen in the constant<br>
  questions about them to Rabbi Eliezer memtioned in two chapters ago. Now<br>
  however, in these later third and fourth centuries, with the power of<br>
  the Evyonim obviously in decline, Jewish interest in things concerning<br>
  the Jewish Jesus tradition abated. Jews began to look upon the Evyonim<br>
  as no longer a threat.</p>
<p> Yet another threat arose against the Evyonim and the Christians.<br>
  This occured when the Emperor Diocletian (284 - 305 C.E.) ascended the<br>
  throne. This emperor initiated the last and most bitter persecution of<br>
  Christians and Jewish believers. Diocletian, like the later emperor<br>
  Julian, was an ardent defender of the old Roman pagan religion, and saw<br>
  the religion of Jesus as a threat to the Empire. In C.E. 303, he began a<br>
  war of extermination against believers in Jesus, both Jewish and<br>
  gentile. This included edicts against them which stipulated that their<br>
  churches were to be destroyed, their books confiscated, their priests<br>
  imprisoned, their rights to hold civil service office denied, the<br>
  forfeiture of their lives on whim if they refused to sacrifice to the<br>
  Roman gods. These edicts severely weakened the gentile churches,<br>
  bringing many martyrdoms as well as many aposties. Moreover they were<br>
  more enforced in the East than in the West, mainly in Syria, Phoenicia,<br>
  and Palestine, leading to the near eradication of the Jewish followers.<br>
  Diocletian woudl no doubt have accomplished his end, had he not died and<br>
  been succeeded by Constantine.</p>
<p> Nevertheless, Diocletian showed tolerance to the Jews, exempting<br>
  them from various taxes (Tractate Avodah Zarah 44a). Needless to say,<br>
  the rabbis looked upon him rather favorably (Tractate Berachot 6a).<br>
  Whatever his reasons were for this favorable treatment of Jews, spiting<br>
  the Christians was probably among them.</p>
<p> By the year C.E. 311-312, there were two Roman Emperors reigning<br>
  simultaneously; Constantinein the West, and Licinius in the East. In 321<br>
  a civil war broke out between them. Because Constantine favored<br>
  Christianity, Licinius saw the believers in Jesus as a 5th column<br>
  threat. Hence because it was known that Eastern believers favored<br>
  Constantine, Licinius began another severe persecution of them in the<br>
  East. This persecution, which lasted 3 years, until Constantine's<br>
  victory in 324, further weakened the remaining Evyon communities.</p>
<p> There is a somewhat startling Gemarah found in the Mishnah Sotah<br>
  (9:15) attributed to Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanos, whom we encountered two<br>
  chapters ago. He was the so-called &quot;Christian expert&quot; who had been 
  put<br>
  under the ban of excommunication for alleged membership in the Nazarene<br>
  group.</p>
<p> &quot;Eliezer the Great said, 'Before the messiah comes ... the<br>
  kingdom will be turned to heresy.&quot;</p>
<p> This same sentiment is also found in other sources of the Oral<br>
  Tradition, namely Sanhedrin 97b attributed to Rabbi Yitschak, elsewhere<br>
  by Rabbi Nehemyah, a disciple of Rabbi Akiva (source unknown).</p>
<p> Rabbi Yitschak lived at the time of Constantine and witnessed his<br>
  conversion to Christianity. HIS restatement of the earlier dictum was<br>
  surely interpreted by him to mean that the kingdom of Rome had turned<br>
  from pure paganism to the religion of the gentile church. Both Rabbis<br>
  Eliezer and Nehemyah lived nearly 200 hundred years before Constantine<br>
  so their usage of the saying that the kingdom will turn to heresy cannot<br>
  have anything to do with Constantine but does it have anything to do<br>
  with Christianity? According to Judaism, a gentile cannt be considered a<br>
  heretic, and by the time of Constantine, Jews no longer considered<br>
  Christianity to be a heresey. It was by that time looked on as a foreign<br>
  religion. Yet at the time of Rabbi Eliezer, Christianity was still being<br>
  confused with Nazarenism by Jews and the idea that this Jewish heresy<br>
  was spreading amongst the gentiles was disquieting, and the fact that it<br>
  was quickly being adopted by so many Romans was looked upon as a sign of<br>
  the religious confusion that would abound before the messiah came. In<br>
  the mouth of Rabbi Yitschak it probably has a much different context.<br>
  Rabbi Acha, a contemporary of Rabbi Yistchak, is quoted (Tractate<br>
  Nedarim 38a) as saying in the name of Rabbi Huna that &quot;the wicked Esau<br>
  will don his prayer shawl and sit down with the righteous&quot;. Esau is the<br>
  Jewish code-name for Rome and &quot;the righteous&quot; obviously refers to<br>
  Israel. That the Roman Empire (or Emperor) wraps itself in a Jewish<br>
  prayer shawl is a statement that Rome now considers itself the true<br>
  Israel. The fact of the now CHRISTIAN Roman Empire was a further sign to<br>
  Jews of frsutration and hopelessness that could only be aleviated by the<br>
  appearence of the messiah.</p>
<p> But if Constantine's conversion to Christianity in CE 313 was<br>
  seen as a source of frustration to the Jews, it was seen as an absolute<br>
  calamity by the Jewish followers of Jesus. It was to them the supreme<br>
  sorrowfull irony that the very kingdom that crucified their messiah as<br>
  an insurrectionist, that destroyed the Holy City of their people, and<br>
  that continued to oppress their people, should now adopt the religion of<br>
  &quot;that man&quot; (Paul) who nullified the Torah and turned the Son of Man 
  into<br>
  a deity to be worshipped, and that that same arrogant kingdom should now<br>
  claim to be the inheritors and true descendants of their father Abraham.</p>
<p> As soon as Christianity became the official state religion of<br>
  the Roman Empire, church leaders convinced the newly converted Caesar to<br>
  enact several laws discriminatory to Jews and Judaism which they viewed<br>
  as dangerous rivals. For even at this time Jews and Nazarenes were still<br>
  actively and successfully converting gentiles to their respective<br>
  faiths. It is instructive that the very religion that had earlier asked<br>
  for tolleration from the government now refused to give tolleration to<br>
  others once they BECAME the government, and that they felt too<br>
  spiritually insecure to let religious argumentation prove the day.<br>
  Instead, under severest penalty, Jews (including Evyonim) were forbidden<br>
  to carry on further missionary work, they could no longer convert their<br>
  pagan slaves and they were henceforth forbidden to own Christian slaves.<br>
  Although there is no documentary evidence it is not hard to envision<br>
  that the penalties were more severe when the convicted were Jewish<br>
  believers in Jesus who were considered as heretics whereas ordinary<br>
  rabbinic Jews were merely considered as religious rivals for the hearts<br>
  and souls of the pagans.</p>
<p> In C.E. 325, the Council of Nicaea was convened to give formal<br>
  structure to what would soon be the newly emerging Roman Catholic<br>
  Church. Among the statutes enacted at the Council were the following:<br>
  Christians were forbidden to eat MATSAH on Passover, and to visit<br>
  synagogues or to listen to the religious preaching or religious<br>
  instruction of Jews; the time of the celebration of Easter was separated<br>
  from the time of the celebration of Passover; strongly condemned the<br>
  Christian observance of the Sabbath as the day of rest, and substituted<br>
  Sunday as the Christian day of rest. It is instructive that the Church<br>
  leaders felt these measures necessary because they show the still<br>
  tremendous appeal and attraction of Judaism for Christians even after<br>
  three centuries. At the same time, Christian orators incited mobs to<br>
  riot against Jewish communities. The Christian clergy attempted to<br>
  justify their actions by claiming that Jews constitued a danger to<br>
  Christianity because THEY ATTRACTED PAGANS TO JUDAISM AND CAUSED HERESY<br>
  AMONG CHRISTIANS!!!! This is something to think about.</p>
<p> The situation became alleviated in CE 361 when the emperor Julian<br>
  ascended the throne of Rome. After several Christian emperors, this one<br>
  completely repudiated Christianity and favored the old pagan religion.<br>
  On his ascension to power, he immediately set out to undo all that the<br>
  Christian emperors before him had done to Christianize the Empire. To<br>
  Christians, and to history, he became known as Julian the Apostate. Part<br>
  of his policy of de-Christianization had to do with his dealings with<br>
  the Jews. He wrote to the Jews of Erets Yisrael that he would recind all<br>
  the discriminatory legislation that the Christian emperors had enacted<br>
  against them and he also announced that he would help them rebuild the<br>
  Temple at Jerusalem. This may have lightened Jewish hearts but it did<br>
  not have that effect upon the Evyonim. To them it was seen as a further<br>
  setback. For one thing, as idolatrous as Christianity may have seemed to<br>
  them, at least the Christians professed to believe in the G-d of Israel.<br>
  Secondly, they, like the gentile believers in Jesus, felt that the<br>
  Temple had been destroyed by G-d as a sign of His displeasure with the<br>
  sacrificial system. All contemporary events, coupled with Jesus'<br>
  continued failure to reappear, seemed like a complete setback to all<br>
  their hopes and expectations, and this probably contributed greatly to<br>
  the weakening of their will to survive. It was as though, after three<br>
  centuries of stubborn tenaciousness in the face of all odds, G-d had<br>
  deceived them or they had deceived themselves. Probably at this time,<br>
  many of them opted to abandon their faith in the reappearence of Jesus<br>
  and to return to the larger Jewish community.</p>
<p> A generation after Rabbi Abahu, in the middle of the fourth<br>
  century, gives us the following story about Rabbi Tanhuna. (Tractate<br>
  Sanhedrin 91a). During a religious argument with Caesar, the Emperor<br>
  bcame angry at Rabbi Tanhuma and had him cast into the lion's den.<br>
  However the lion did not touch him and those who observed this tended to<br>
  look upon it as a miracle. A certain Jewish believer in Jesus said to<br>
  the Emperor that it was not a miracle at all, simply that the lion was<br>
  not hungry. At that, the exasperated Caesar removed Tanhuma and had the<br>
  Evyon thrown into the den whereupon the lion attacked and ate him. The<br>
  probability is that the Caesar spoken of here was Julian, called the<br>
  Apostate, who reigned from CE 361 to CE 363. Julian threw off the<br>
  Christianity of his predecessors and returned to Paganism. It is well<br>
  known that he disliked Christians and favored Jews, even wishing to help<br>
  them rebuild the Temple. The major import of the story is to show the<br>
  ongoing animosity of the Jews and the Evyonim, and to show how Julian's<br>
  rise to power only added to the steadily worsening lot of the latter.</p>
<p> Nevertheless, Julian's reign ended and his successor reintroduced<br>
  Christianity as the Roman state religion. The gentile church regained<br>
  its power and quickly grew to become the Roman Catholic Church. The<br>
  Jewish &quot;church&quot;, weakened by persecution, unable to do any large scale<br>
  proselytization, and broken in spirit by the continuing disappoinment at<br>
  Jesus' failure to appear and usher in G-d's Kingdom on earth, entered<br>
  its final death throes.</p>
<p> The Christian writer, Epiphanius, reports a viable Evyoni settlement on the 
  island of Cyprus in the year C.E. 377, where all stil &quot;held things in common 
  and laid their possessions at the feet of the leaders&quot;. St. Augustine, 
  in the year C.E. 400, reports an Evyoni<br>
  community in North Africa. Yet despite the existence of these communities, the 
  day of the Jewish followers of Jesus was coming to an end. Finally, in the fifth 
  century, the last Evyoni communities, located in Eastern Syria, blended with 
  the various gentile Christian communities there and disappeared forever from 
  history. To be sure, there were some of them who wished to return to the Jewish 
  people, but they were only able to do so by undergoing ritual conversion like 
  any gentile.</p>
