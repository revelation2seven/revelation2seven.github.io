<p>have no need for that hypothesis,&quot; Pierre-Simon Laplace famously responded 
  when asked where God fit into his new astronomical theory. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Psalm 
  14; Romans 1:16-20)</font>. Using calculus and Newton's laws of gravity, he 
  explained the forces that kept the planets from gradually drifting out of orbit, 
  imparting some stability to the solar system. Newton had thought the Great Engineer 
  must step in now and then to readjust the machine. The theory didn't explain 
  where the solar system came from. But Laplace also had an answer. The planets, 
  he proposed, had congealed from a swirling cloud of gas and dust surrounding 
  the sun.</p>
<p>O.K., so where did the sun and the mother cloud come from? And what set the 
  whole thing revolving? By now, scientists think they have even those answers, 
  AND THEY DO NOT INVOLVE THE INTERVENTION OF ANY GREAT ENGINEER. The whole point 
  of science for the last few hundred years has been to explain everything in 
  terms of a physical process, something that can be described by equations.</p>
<p>The quest, however, is far from done. God, for those who want to use that term, 
  can be invoked to account for phenomena that have not yet yielded to the scientific 
  method. What is for some the ultimate question &#151; Does God exist? &#151; 
  has become a matter of how much further the domain of the unknown will continue 
  to contract, and if it will ultimately evaporate.</p>
<p>The momentum has been in that direction. The whirlpool of cosmic stuff that 
  spawned the solar system spins because it is one small part of the great rotating 
  galaxy, the Milky Way. When a random fluctuation causes enough gas and dust 
  to bunch together, gravity takes over and celestial bodies begin to form. If 
  you want to know where the galaxies came from, there are answers as well. Ultimately, 
  it all comes down to the Big Bang. That is where the chain of reasoning bottoms 
  out. What caused the primordial explosion? At this point all but a few scientists 
  go with Wittgenstein (&quot;of what we cannot speak we must pass over in silence&quot;) 
  or with Kierkegaard, blindly taking the leap of faith into the abyss of the 
  unknown, choosing what to believe...</p>

<p>Why there is something instead of nothing is not an issue that science is well 
  equipped to address. As cosmologists understand it, the primordial eruption 
  did not take place at a certain instant in a certain place. The Big Bang created 
  absolutely everything, including space-time itself. How can anyone ask what 
  set the whole thing going if there was no space or time for a creator to be 
  in, much less any matter or energy for Him or Her or It to work with?</p>
<p>This rather formidable obstacle doesn't prevent a few people, some of them 
  scientists, from trying to prove, or disprove, the existence of a deity. Almost 
  any book or conference on science and religion inevitably includes what has 
  become a metaphysical set piece: The various parameters of the universe &#151; 
  the charge of the electron, the strength of gravity, and so forth &#151; appear 
  to be finely tuned to support the existence of stars and atoms and molecules 
  and life. If the conditions at the instant of the Big Bang had been slightly 
  different, the argument goes, then the universe (at least from an earthling's 
  point of view) would have been a colossal waste of space-time. So we are the 
  lucky benefactors of blind chance, or life was planned all along &#151; either 
  by a Great Intender or by some physical or mathematical or logical law or process. 
  Ignore the great Wittgensteinian whisper and you feel the queasy discomfort 
  of a human mind pushed to the edge of what it is possible to know.</p>
<p>One theory is that the Big Bang actually spawned a plenitude of universes each 
  randomly endowed with different physical conditions. People, of course, find 
  themselves in one that is capable of supporting life.</p>

  By NICHOLAS WADE</p>
<p align="center"><i><font size="+1">And God said, Let there be light (Life): 
  and there was (Life)...</font></i><font size="+1">(Genesis 1:3; John 1:3-5).</font></p>
<p>The origin of life is biology's most daunting problem. Scientists are good 
  at understanding processes that they can study. But the emergence of life was 
  a single event that occurred 3.5 billion to 4 billion years ago. Even the rocks 
  of that era have mostly vanished. Some progress is being made at reconstructing 
  the process that led to the first living cells. But it consists of conjectures 
  of varying plausibility, not proof.</p>
<p>Modern cells are such complex devices that it is hard to conceive how they 
  could have assembled spontaneously from the chemicals available on the primitive 
  earth. A recent approach to the problem, developed by G&uuml;nter W&auml;chtersha&uuml;ser, 
  a Munich chemist and patent lawyer, goes as follows. Forget, he says, the sophisticated 
  molecules that run today's cells &#151; the DNA that stores information, the 
  RNA that runs operations, the proteins that serve as structural material and 
  controllers of chemical metabolism. All those must have come later. Forget about 
  the cell membrane &#151; ways to get things in and out of it must also have 
  developed later.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg162.gif" width="387" height="701">

<p align="center"><b>John 1:1-14. (KJV)</b></p>
<p>Life must have started in the simplest possible way, as a cycle, a natural 
  chemical reaction that repeated itself, spinning off byproducts, some of which 
  stayed around to maintain and develop the cycle.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/WaterFireAirEarth.gif" width="380" height="338"> 
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Every living organism, including Man, is created out of the 
  Four primary elements.</b></p>
<p>Where did this cycle start? Dr. W&auml;chtersha&uuml;ser favors some mineral 
  surface like iron pyrites, also known as fool's gold. A natural catalyst, the 
  iron pyrites could have assembled chemicals like carbon monoxide into biological 
  building blocks. At some stage, the little cycle acquired a cover of protective 
  chemicals, to separate its own reactions from the general milieu. When the cover 
  eventually enveloped the cycle and broke free of the mineral surface, the first 
  cell was born.</p>
<p>Dr. W&auml;chtersha&uuml;ser and others have shown that important components 
  of today's biochemistry can be formed on iron pyrite surfaces, notably pyruvate, 
  the fuel for a basic energy-producing reaction known as the citric acid cycle.</p>
<p>A different entry point to the origin of life concerns RNA, the close chemical 
  cousin of DNA. Though DNA gets the attention, it is RNA that performs all of 
  the trickiest operations in the cell, whether retrieving information from the 
  DNA or turning this information into proteins. Biologists have long supposed 
  that RNA was the pivotal actor in the earliest cells and later delegated most 
  of its information-storage duties to DNA, a less versatile but stabler chemical. 
  The concept gained credence when Dr. Thomas R. Cech and Dr. Sidney Altman discovered 
  independently that RNA could act as an enzyme, a catalyst of chemical activities, 
  as well as store genetic information.</p>

<p>This dual property of RNA seems in principle to resolve one of life's thornier 
  paradoxes, that DNA requires a protein catalyst for its replication, and the 
  protein requires DNA to make it, implying neither could exist without the other's 
  being there first. RNA could have performed both functions. Chemists have not 
  yet devised an RNA molecule that can replicate itself. But they have shown that 
  RNA molecules can copy short pieces of RNA. That bolsters the idea that before 
  DNA there was an RNA world in which RNA, or some similar precursor polymer, 
  ran the show.</p>
<p>The subunits of RNA molecules are themselves quite complex chemicals. It is 
  not too easy to see how the first RNA molecules could have come into existence. 
  But A CLAY called montmorillonite, formed from weathered volcanic ash and familiar 
  in many households as cat litter, has the interesting property of catalyzing 
  the formation of RNA from its subunits. In an article in Science magazine last 
  month, researchers from the Massachusetts General Hospital reported that the 
  montmorillonite clay had another property of possible relevance to the origin 
  of life. It makes droplets of fat molecules rearrange themselves into small 
  bubbles, similar to the membranes that make up the walls of living cells. Often 
  the clay particles are incorporated into the bubbles, the research team found, 
  with any attached RNA molecules. &quot;Mineral particles may have greatly facilitated 
  the emergence of the first cells,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>In a second experiment, the researchers found that they could make their protocells 
  divide by forcing them through fine holes in a filter. A natural counterpart 
  to this process, they suggest, would be water currents' forcing bubbles through 
  rock pores.</p>
<p>Volcanoes, whether on land or in the vents of the mid-sea floors, have exotic 
  chemistries and processes that make them attractive candidates venues for the 
  origin of life. But Jack W. Szostak, an one of the Massachusetts researchers, 
  warned that it would be of it would be &quot;overinterpreting&quot; the experiments 
  to say they pointed to vents as the spot where life emerged.</p>
<p>Researchers are a long way from reconstructing any plausible path for the origin 
  of life. But they have not given up. And they always conclude, no matter how 
  fragmentary their evidence, that life is possible.</p>

  <font size="+1">IS EVOLUTION TRULY RANDOM?</font><br>
  By CAROL KAESUK YOON</p>
<p>In nearly every life, there is a moment when a person realizes, with a shudder, 
  how easily she might never have come to be: how her parents nearly missed meeting, 
  or how some other critical genealogical event almost didn't happen. In the same 
  way, evolutionary biologists have pondered one of their most intractable questions: 
  how much of the living world is here by chance, and might not evolve, if time 
  were turned back and evolutionary history played out again? A few scientists 
  have begun finding ingenious ways to test the repeatability of evolution. And 
  they are finding that what they thought were the random vagaries of evolution 
  are not so random at all.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of phenomenal data coming out,&quot; said Dr. Loren H. 
  Rieseberg, an evolutionary biologist at Indiana University. &quot;There's clearly 
  more to repeatability than we'd suspected a decade ago.&quot; Dr. Richard E. 
  Lenski, an evolutionary biologist at Michigan State, said, &quot;A lot of studies 
  are finding quite a lot of surprising replicability of evolutionary outcomes.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Jay Gould, the late Harvard paleontologist, crystallized the question 
  in his book &quot;Wonderful Life.&quot; What would happen, he asked, if the 
  tape of the history of life were rewound and replayed? For many, including Dr. 
  Gould, the answer was clear. He wrote that &quot;any replay of the tape would 
  lead evolution down a pathway radically different from the road actually taken.&quot; 
  In fact, to many scientists, it would seem impossible to re-evolve anything 
  like life on earth today, given how life has been shaped by accidents large 
  and small.</p>
<p>But 12 flasks of bacteria in East Lansing, Mich., are beginning to challenge 
  such notions. In 1988, Dr. Lenski and his colleagues set up a dozen genetically 
  identical populations of E. coli bacteria in bottles of broth and have followed 
  their evolutionary fates. Now, more than 30,000 bacterial generations later, 
  Dr. Lenski and colleagues have what is becoming one of the most striking examples 
  of repeatability yet. All 12 populations show the same patterns of improvement 
  in their ability to compete in a bottle and increases in cell size. All 12 have 
  also lost their ability to break down and use a sugar, called ribose. More surprising, 
  many genetic changes underlying these adaptations are very similar. Every population, 
  for example, lost its ability to break down ribose by losing a long stretch 
  of DNA from the same gene. Other scientists studying cichlid fish have observed 
  how the same varieties of cichlids evolve anew every time they invade a new 
  lake. And Dr. Rieseberg and colleagues have found evidence that evolution can 
  repeatedly produce the same species.</p>
<p>These scientists found that one sunflower species on sand dunes has evolved 
  independently three separate times. And each time one of the species newly evolves, 
  genetically it appears to turn out much the same. &quot;With these species, 
  there seems to be only one way to do it,&quot; Dr. Rieseberg said.</p>
<p>Some scientists, like Dr. Simon Conway Morris, a paleobiologist at the University 
  of Cambridge and ardent critic of Dr. Gould's view, say the evidence for repeatability 
  is rampant. He argues in his new book, &quot;Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans 
  in a Lonely Universe,&quot; that some features are so adaptive that they are 
  essentially inevitable &#151; like the ability to see and, as his title suggests, 
  the intelligence and self-awareness that are the hallmarks of humanity.</p>
<p>Still, scientists say that EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS evolving in parallel are 
  not identical. For example, the genetic changes underlying identical adaptations 
  in different populations can differ, even if in minute detail. Are these the 
  subtle differences that could send evolution down a different path? Only the 
  definitive experiment which remains beyond the scope of the National Science 
  Foundation budget can say.</p>
<p>&quot;What we need are about 1,000 worlds to play evolution back correctly,&quot; 
  Dr. Rieseberg said. &quot;THEN WE CAN REALLY FIND OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.&quot;

  <div align="center"><font size="+1">IS WAR OUR BIOLOGICAL DESTINY?</font><br>
    By NATALIE ANGIER </div>
</blockquote>
<p>Published: November 11, 2003__In these days of hidebound militarism and round-robin 
  carnage, when even that beloved ambassador of peace, the Dalai Lama, says it 
  may be necessary to counter terrorism with violence, it's fair to ask: Is humanity 
  doomed? Are we born for the battlefield &#151; congenitally, hormonally incapable 
  of putting war behind us? Is there no alternative to the bullet-riddled trapdoor, 
  short of mass sedation or a Marshall Plan for our DNA? Was Plato right that 
  &quot;Only the dead have seen the end of war&quot;? </p>
<p>In the heartening if admittedly provisional opinion of a number of researchers 
  who study warfare, aggression, and the evolutionary roots of conflict, the great 
  philosopher was, for once, whistling in a cave. As they see it, blood lust and 
  the desire to wage war are by no means innate. To the contrary, recent studies 
  in the field of game theory show just how readily human beings establish cooperative 
  networks with one another, and how quickly a cooperative strategy reaches a 
  point of so-called fixation. Researchers argue that one need not be a Pollyanna, 
  or even an aging hippie, to imagine a human future in which war is rare and 
  universally condemned.</p>

<p>They point out that slavery was long an accepted fact of life; if your side 
  lost the battle, tough break, the wife and kids were shipped off as slaves to 
  the victors. Now, when cases of slavery arise in the news, they are considered 
  perverse and unseemly. The incentive to make war similarly anachronistic is 
  enormous, say the researchers, though they worry that it may take the dropping 
  of another nuclear bomb in the middle of a battlefield before everybody gets 
  the message. &quot;I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought,&quot; 
  Albert Einstein said, &quot;but World War IV will be fought with sticks and 
  stones.&quot;</p>
<p>Admittedly, war making will be a hard habit to shake. &quot;There have been 
  very few times in the history of civilization when there hasn't been a war going 
  on somewhere,&quot; said Victor Davis Hanson, a military historian and classicist 
  at California State University in Fresno. He cites a brief period between A.D. 
  100 and A.D. 200 as perhaps the only time of world peace, the result of the 
  Roman Empire's having everyone, fleetingly, in its thrall. </p>
<p>Archaeologists and anthropologists have found evidence of militarism in perhaps 
  95 percent of the cultures they have examined or unearthed. Time and again groups 
  initially lauded as gentle and peace-loving &#151; the Mayas, the !Kung of the 
  Kalahari, Margaret Mead's Samoans, &#151; eventually were outed as being no 
  less bestial than the rest of us. A few isolated cultures have managed to avoid 
  war for long stretches. The ancient Minoans, for example, who populated Crete 
  and the surrounding Aegean Islands, went 1,500 years battle-free; it didn't 
  hurt that they had a strong navy to deter would-be conquerors. </p>
<p>Warriors have often been the most esteemed of their group, the most coveted 
  mates. And if they weren't loved for themselves, their spears were good courtship 
  accessories. This year, geneticists found evidence that Genghis Khan, the 13th 
  century Mongol emperor, fathered so many offspring as he slashed through Asia 
  that 16 million men, or half a percent of the world's male population, could 
  be his descendants.</p>
<p>Wars are romanticized, subjects of an endless, cross-temporal, transcultural 
  spool of poems, songs, plays, paintings, novels, films. The battlefield is mythologized 
  as the furnace in which character and nobility are forged; and, oh, what a thrill 
  it can be. &quot;The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction,&quot; 
  writes Chris Hedges, a reporter for The New York Times who has covered wars, 
  in &quot;WAR IS A FORCE THAT GIVES US MEANING.&quot; Even with its destruction 
  and carnage, he adds, war &quot;can give us what we long for in life.&quot; 
  &quot;It can give us purpose, meaning, a reason for living,&quot; he continues.</p>

<p>Nor are humans the only great apes to indulge in the elixir. Common chimpanzees, 
  which share about 98 percent of their genes with humans, also wage war: gangs 
  of neighboring males meet at the borderline of their territories with the express 
  purpose of exterminating their opponents. So many males are lost to battle that 
  the sex ratio among adult chimpanzees is two females for every male.</p>
<p>And yet there are other drugs on the market, other behaviors to sate the savage 
  beast. Dr. Frans de Waal, a primatologist and professor of psychology at Emory 
  University, points out that a different species of chimpanzee, the bonobo, chooses 
  love over war, using a tantric array of sexual acts to resolve any social problems 
  that arise. Serious bonobo combat is rare, and the male-to-female ratio is, 
  accordingly, 1:1. Bonobos are as closely related to humans as are common chimpanzees, 
  so take your pick of which might offer deeper insight into the primal &quot;roots&quot; 
  of human behavior. Or how about hamadryas baboons? They're surly, but not silly. 
  If you throw a peanut in front of a male, Dr. de Waal said, it will pick it 
  up happily and eat it. Throw the same peanut in front of two male baboons, and 
  they'll ignore it. &quot;They'll act as if it doesn't exist,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;It's not worth a fight between two fully grown males.&quot;</p>
<p>Even the ubiquitousness of warfare in human history doesn't impress researchers. 
  &quot;When you consider it was only about 13,000 years ago that we discovered 
  agriculture, and that most of what we're calling human history occurred since 
  then,&quot; said Dr. David Sloan Wilson, a biology and anthropology professor 
  at Binghamton University in New York, &quot;you see what a short amount of time 
  we've had to work toward global peace.&quot; </p>
<p>In that brief time span, the size of cooperative groups has grown steadily, 
  and by many measures more pacific. Maybe 100 million people died in the world 
  wars of the 20th century. Yet Dr. Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor of anthropology 
  at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has estimated that if the proportion 
  of casualties in the modern era were to equal that seen in many conflicts among 
  preindustrial groups, then perhaps two billion people would have died.</p>
<p>Indeed, national temperaments seem capable of rapid, radical change. The Vikings 
  slaughtered and plundered; their descendants in Sweden haven't fought a war 
  in nearly 200 years, while the Danes reserve their fighting spirit for negotiating 
  better vacation packages. The tribes of highland New Guinea were famous for 
  small-scale warfare, said Dr. Peter J. Richerson, an expert in cultural evolution 
  at the University of California at Davis. &quot;But when, after World War II, 
  the Australian police patrols went around and told people they couldn't fight 
  anymore, the New Guineans thought that was wonderful,&quot; Dr. Richerson said. 
  &quot;They were glad to have an excuse.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson cites the results of game theory experiments: participants can adopt 
  a cheating strategy to try to earn more for themselves, but at the risk of everybody's 
  losing, or a cooperative strategy with all earning a smaller but more reliable 
  reward. In laboratories around the world, researchers have found that participants 
  implement the mutually beneficial strategy, in which cooperators are rewarded 
  and noncooperators are punished. &quot;It shows in a very simple and powerful 
  way that it's easy to get cooperation to evolve to fixation, for it to be the 
  successful strategy,&quot; he said. There is no such quantifiable evidence or 
  theoretical underpinning in favor of Man the Warrior, he added.</p>
<p>As Dr. de Waal and many others see it, the way to foment peace is to encourage 
  interdependency among nations, as in the European Union. &quot;Imagine if France 
  were to invade Germany now,&quot; he said. &quot;That would upset every aspect 
  of their economic world,&quot; not the least one being France's reliance on 
  the influx of German tourists. &quot;It's not as if Europeans all love each 
  other,&quot; Dr. de Waal said. &quot;But you're not promoting love, you're promoting 
  economic calculations.&quot; </p>
<p>It's not just the money. Who can put a price tag on the pleasures to be had 
  from that wholesome, venerable sport &#151; making fun of the tourists? </p>

  <font size="+1">HOW DOES THE BRAIN WORK?</font><br>
  By SANDRA BLAKESLEE</p>
<p>In the continuing effort to understand the human brain, the mysteries keep 
  piling up. Consider what scientists are up against. Stretched flat, the human 
  neocortex &#151; the center of our higher mental functions &#151; is about the 
  size and thickness of a formal dinner napkin. With 100 billion cells, each with 
  1,000 to 10,000 synapses, the neocortex makes roughly 100 trillion connections 
  and contains 300 million feet of wiring packed with other tissue into a one-and-a-half-quart 
  volume in the brain.</p>
<p>These cells are arranged in six very similar layers, inviting confusion. Within 
  these layers, different regions carry out vision, hearing, touch, the sense 
  of balance, movement, emotional responses and every other feat of cognition. 
  More mysterious yet, there are 10 times as many feedback connections &#151; 
  from the neocortex to lower levels of the brain &#151; as there are feed-forward 
  or bottom-up connections. </p>
<p>Added to these mysteries is the lack of a good framework for understanding 
  the brain's connectivity and electrochemistry. Researchers do not know how the 
  six-layered cortical sheet gives rise to the sense of self. They have not been 
  able to disentangle the role of genes and experience in shaping brains. They 
  do not know how the firing of billions of loosely coupled neurons gives rise 
  to coordinated, goal-directed behavior. THEY CAN SEE TREES BUT NO FOREST....</p>

<p align="center"><b>But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for 
  they hear...(Matthew 13:1-16...KJV).</b></p>
<p>They do think they have solved one longstanding mystery, though. Most neuroscientists 
  are convinced the mind is in no way separate from the brain. In the brain they 
  have found a physical basis for all our thoughts, aspirations, language, sense 
  of consciousness, moral beliefs and everything else that makes us human. All 
  of this arises from interactions among billions of ordinary cells. NEUROSCIENCE 
  FINDS NO DUALITY, NO FINGER OF GOD ANIMATING THE HUMAN MIND. </p>
<p>So what have neuroscientists been doing? Like a child who takes apart his father's 
  watch, they have dissected the brain and now have almost all the pieces laid 
  out before them. There are thousands of clues about what makes the brain tick. 
  But how to put it back together? How to understand something so complex by examining 
  it piecemeal? Even harder, how to integrate the different levels of analysis? 
  Some brain events occur in fractions of milliseconds while others, like long-term 
  memory formation, can take days or weeks. One can study molecules, ion channels, 
  single neurons, functional areas, circuits, oscillations and chemistry. There 
  are neural stem cells and mechanisms of plasticity, which involve how the brain 
  changes with experience or recovers from injury.</p>

<p>New research tools continue to drive progress. In the late 1970's, researchers 
  mostly placed sharp-tipped electrodes into single cells and measured firing 
  patterns. By the 1990's, they had machines that could take images of brain activity 
  while people spoke, read, gambled, solved moral dilemmas or, in a recent study, 
  had orgasms. Unfortunately, studies like these, while fascinating, tend to feed 
  the fires of a huge disagreement within the brain sciences: is the brain made 
  up of discrete modules that pass information among themselves? Or is it more 
  loosely organized so that varied pockets of distant neurons fire together when 
  called upon to perform a particular task? In mapping the brain, some researchers 
  say that areas dedicated to aspects of language, arm movements or face recognition 
  are hard-wired modules. Other researchers say that such areas are surprisingly 
  flexible. For example, the human face recognition area is where expert bird 
  watchers distinguish features of closely related species or car experts decide 
  if a 1958 or 1959 Plymouth had bigger fins. </p>
<p>While the two sides in this debate agree that the brain is prewired to some 
  degree at birth, the nature of that prewiring is uncertain. What do genes expressed 
  in the brain do? How do genes influence behavior? What is innate and what is 
  flexible? What is the role of culture in shaping a brain? </p>
<p>While lacking a coherent framework, scientists are nevertheless making progress 
  in mapping the correlations between brain activity and behavior. New imaging 
  tools reveal circuits and overall patterns of activity as people solve problems 
  or reflect on their feelings. Genes expressed in mouse brain cells are being 
  mapped so that researchers can begin to find out if neurons that look alike 
  have different proteins and functions. A magnetic device can knock out human 
  brain regions, safely and temporarily, to learn what those regions do.</p>
<p>A lively debate continues over the nature of time in brain function. In the 
  absence of stimulation from the outside world, NEURONS REMAIN ACTIVE; they are 
  filled with electrical currents that give them a propensity to oscillate and, 
  on interacting, create spiking patterns of activity. Do the spikes carry precise 
  information? Or do such spikes average out over large areas? HOW IS INFORMATION 
  CARRIED IN THE BRAIN? </p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</font></i></p>

</blockquote>
<p>One of the most exciting developments is the recent exploration of the frontal 
  lobes. Located behind the forehead, the frontal lobes help create the social 
  brain, melding emotions, cognition, error detection, the body, volition and 
  an autobiographical sense of self. Special circuits containing spindle cells 
  appear to broadcast messages &#151; this feels right, this does not feel right 
  &#151; to the rest of the brain. Researchers are finding that emotions arise 
  from body states as well as brain states, confirming that the supposed distinction 
  between mind and body is illusory. </p>
<p>Others are delving into individual differences. What makes one person empathic, 
  another mean or shy or articulate or musical? How do genes relate to temperament 
  and how is a baby's brain constructed from early experience? Specialized cells 
  called mirror neurons seem to help babies imitate the world to learn gestures, 
  facial expressions, language and feelings. Brain chemistry is no longer the 
  study of neuromodulators as &quot;juices&quot; that make us feel good or awake. 
  Substances like serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine play crucial roles in 
  learning, updating memories and neuropsychiatric disease. </p>
<p>THE QUESTION OF FREE WILL IS ON THE TABLE. Some of our behavior is conscious, 
  but most of it is notoriously unconscious. So although we make choices, IS FREE 
  WILL MOSTLY AN ILLUSION? And what is consciousness? In seeking an explanation, 
  a new mystery has emerged. Many scientists now believe that the brain basically 
  works by simulating reality. The sights, sounds and touches that flow into the 
  brain are put in the framework of what the brain expects on the basis of previous 
  experience and memory. </p>
<p>In the words of many neuroscientists, all these mysteries are terrific job 
  security.</p>
