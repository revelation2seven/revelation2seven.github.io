    to return once again, to that which will not be. It is they, however, by themselves, 
    who are greater, more powerful, and more honored than the names which are 
    given to them, which are (their) shadows. In the manner of a reflection are 
    they beautiful. For the face of the copy normally takes its beauty from that 
    of which it is a copy. </font>(They are copies one of another)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

    they are beings existing by themselves and are without a source, since they 
    do not see anything else existing before them. Therefore they lived in disobedience

    because of whom they came into being.</font></p>

    imagining that it is superior to his fellows...Therefore, it happened that 
    many offspring came forth from them, as fighters, as warriors, as troublemakers, 
    as apostates. They are disobedient beings, lovers of power. All the other 
    beings of this sort were brought forth from these.&quot; </font>The Tripartite
