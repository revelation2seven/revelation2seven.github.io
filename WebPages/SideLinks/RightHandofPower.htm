    <p><i><font size="+1">That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ (Hesus-Crishna), 
      the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of Wisdom and Revelation 
      in the knowledge of Him:</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">THE EYES OF YOUR UNDERSTANDING BEING ENLIGHTENED, that 
      ye may know what is the hope of His calling, and the riches of the glory 
      of His inheritance in the saints.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">And what is the exceeding greatness of His Power to 
      us-ward who believe, according to the working of His mighty Power,</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Which He wrought in Christ, when he raised him from 
      the dead, AND SET HIM AT HIS OWN RIGHT HAND IN HEAVENLY PLACES,</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Far above all principality, and power, and might, and 
      dominion, and every Name that is named, not only in this world, but also 
      in that which is to come.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">And hath put all things UNDER HIS FEET, and gave him 
      to be the head over all things to the church,</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Which is his Body, the fulness of him that filleth all 
      in all...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ephesians 1:17-23).</font></p>

      Love wherewith He loved us,</font></i></p>

    <p>&quot;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Christ, or the 
      Higher Self, is the fundamental principle underlying the idea of personal 
      Godhood; and is the Divine Life which proceeds forth from the Absolute, 
      as the Son from the Father, to enter the world of manifestation and animate 
      all things. He it is who is the Divine Sacrifice, in that he limits himself 
      within all his creatures. Again, when involution and evolution are accomplished, 
      </font><font size="+1">(see Eph. 4:8-10)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">, 
      he leaves the world and departs to the Father, taking with him the results 
      of the soul-process.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Now through that Divine 
      effort of manifesations, all that is expressed and comprised in mineral, 
      vegatal, animal, and human, is lived through in due order in this underworld, 
      whilst the essential Christ, the Lord in heaven, is &quot;seated at the 
      right hand of the Father&quot;; that is, he lives as the Power Actual proceeding 
      from Power Potential. He comes forth in the world-cycle as Saviour and Judge 
      in innumerable cloaks (forms) as the One Life operating diversely in many 
      sheaths.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Dictionary of
