  The Religious Roundtable and the Apostolic Congress are sponsoring a grassroots 
  campaign in support of Israel. Their respective leaders, Chairman Edward E. 
  McAteer and Executive Director Pastor Robert Upton are helping spearhead an 
  effort to assist Israel at this crucial moment in history. The group leads a 
  billboard campaign that petitions President Bush to honor God's covenant with 
  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The campaign reflects the growing concern within 
  the Christian community that the &quot;road map&quot; for &quot;peace&quot; 
  - introduced by the U.S. in conjunction with the European Union, Russia and 
  the U.N. - will dictate the surrender of biblical lands promised to Israel - 
  an affront to all believers. </p>
<p>Thousands of bumper stickers have been sent out nationwide to communities asking 
  that Americans pray that President Bush honor God's covenant with Israel. The 
  billboard campaign delivers the same message and quotes from scripture; &quot;And 
  the Lord said to Jacob.. 'Unto you will I give this land!&quot; (Genesis 35:11-12) 
</p>
<p>The billboards ask that people contact the White House at 202-456-1111 and 
  provides the web site for the Apostolic Congress - www.apostoliccongress.com 
  . These billboards will be appearing shortly in your locales as part of a national 
  campaign, and the bumper stickers continue to be distributed. YOU CAN HELP TO 
  OFFSET THE COST OF THESE BILLBOARDS BY SENDING A TAX-DEDUCTIBLE DONATION TO 
  AFSI, 1623 Third Ave., Suite 205, New York, N.Y. 10128, or calling them with 
  your Visa charge - 212-828-2424. </p>
<p>UPDATE<br>
  The One State Solution billboard campaign (http://www.afsi.org/) is expanding.

  Pueblo, Colorado; Chattanooga and Memphis Tennessee; Fort Smith and Little Rock, 
  Arkansas; Hannibal, Mexico, Hermann, and Joplin, Missouri; Forsyth, N. Stockbridge, 
  Griffith, Villa Rica, Athens and Gainesville, Georgia; Waco, San Antonio, and 
  McGregor Texas; Roanoke and Lynchburg, Virginia; Bridgeport, West Virginia;

  stickers, and financial and promotional support from around the country. Please 
  support the campaign against the &quot;road map.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">The Christian Freedom Foundation </p>
<p>&quot;In April 1976, Sojourners, a progressive evangelical magazine, published 
  a report on a series of secret meetings convened by key Christian Right leaders 
  in 1974 and 1975. Sojourners traced the rise of the New Christian Right to the 
  1974 formation of Third Century Publishers, established for the purpose of promoting 
  books and study guides designed to link a comprehensive conservative political 
  agenda with born-again Christianity.&quot; A meeting in 1974 convened to solidify 
  the financial base for Third Century Publishers, was convened by Arizona Congressman 
  John Conlan and Bill Bright, president of Campus Crusade for Christ, with attendees 
  including 20-25. The initial publications &quot;were directed at manipulating 
  Christians to accept political action as part of Christian thought.&quot; In 
  1975 a meeting was convened by Bright and Conlan to &quot;train regional director 
  in Third Century's strategy to gradually take positions of leadership with the 
  government.&quot; Conlan told regional directors that Bill Bright would be working 
  behind the scenes with his Christian business contacts to secure financing. 
  They realized they needed a tax-exempt foundation that could receive donations 
  for the work of the &quot;for-profit&quot; Third Century. &quot;They approached 
  and eventually took over the Christian Freedom Foundation, started in the 1950s 
  to promote conservative economics,&quot; which was in financial trouble in the 
  1970's. &quot;Eventually Christian Freedom Foundation hired [CNP's] Ed McAteer 
  as director...&quot; [Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Religious Right, 
  p.49-50, Sara Diamond, South End Press, Boston, MA]</p>
<p>The Christian Freedom Foundation backers, &quot;... included [CNP's ]Richard 
  DeVos (AMWAY Corp), Art DeMoss (National Liberty Corp), Arizona Congressman 
  John Conlan, and [CNP's] Ed McAteer, CFF's field director at the time, later 
  field director for the Conservative Caucus, and now head of the Religious Roundtable.... 
  Richard DeVos and John Conlan took control of the Christian Freedom Foundation 
  in 1975. Under this leadership, the foundation became the nonprofit, tax-exempt 
  administrative hub of their political efforts to election Christians to politics...&quot; 
  [http://www.pir.org/gw/ Group: Campus Crusade for Christ (Alfa y Omega) File

<p>&quot; A major transition in the religious right occurred in 1975. Richard 
  M. DeVos, the president of Amway Corporation and, from early 1981until mid -1982, 
  finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, and a group of conservative 
  businessmen including [CNP's] John Talcott of Ocean Spray Cranberries and Art 
  De Moss, board chairman of the National Liberty Insurance Corporation, took 
  control of the tax-exempt Christian Freedom Foundation. (J. Howard Pew started 
  the foundation in 1950 with a grant of $50,000. During the 1960's, the various 
  Pew trusts contributed more than $2 million to CFF. In 1974, the Pew Freedom 
  Trust contributed $300,000. DeVos, who, according to Thomas B. Mechling, has 
  functioned for years as &quot;the quiet Godfather and financial angel of the 
  Religious Right Movement,&quot; contributed $25,000 to CFF in 1974.) Their purpose, 
  apparently, was to use the foundation's tax-exempt status to further religious 
  right organizing efforts and to channel funds into Third Century Publishers. 
  Third Century puts out One Nation Under God, which provides a political rationale 
  for the religious right...Art De Moss admitted publicly that the purpose of 
  CFF was to elect Christian conservatives to Congress in 1976: &quot;The vision 
  is to rebuild the foundations of the Republic as it was when first founded--a 
  'Christian Republic.' We must return to the faith of our fathers.&quot; [Saloma,

  the Salvation Army's William Booth Award, the Socially Responsible Entrepreneur 
  of the Year award, and is a 1998 inductee in the Forbes/Junior Achievement Business 
  Hall of Fame. ....&quot;</p>
<p>He is on the Board of Directors of Robert Schuller Ministries, past Co-chairman 
  of Gerald R. Ford Foundation, served as Co-chairman of the Mutual Broadcasting

  Member, Newcomen Society. <br>
  Past Board Director, Spectrum Health. <br>
  Past Finance Chairman, Republican National Committee. <br>
  United Nations Environment Programme Achievement Award, recipient on behalf 
  of Amway - 1989. Amway also sponsored an &quot;Earth Teacher&quot; award that 
  included a free trip to the U.N. to participate in the United Nations Enviromental 
  Programme (UNEP) Global Youth Forum. Amway also was a sponsor of the U.N. Earth 
  Summit--which brought the Earth Charter. </p>
<p>In an undated Amway brochure titled 3 Decades of Caring: AMWAY, Amway announced 
  that it had launched &quot;a new, five year corporate sponsorship: the Aspen 
  Global Change Institute-which is John Denver's initiative. Amway's partners 
  in the project included the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 
  the United Nations Environment Programme, and the Windstar (John Denver) Foundation.&quot; 
</p>
<p>&quot;In the last election, Amway gave more to the GOP than any other company, 
  including an unprecedented $2.5 million in soft money. DeVos and his wife Helen 
  are also major contributors to Newt Gingrich and GOPAC...In 1989, the company 
  spent a jaw-dropping $38.1 million to settle a suit by Canada's trade office 
  that accused the company of undervaluing merchandise to escape customs duties. 
  This topped a $25 million fine from the province of Ontario in 1983, after Amway 
  pleaded guilty to criminal fraud...&quot; [Mojo &gt;www.motherjones.com/coinop_congress/96mojo_400/devos.html]

<p>In the book, Amway Motivational Organizations: Behind the Smoke and Mirrors, 
  by Ruth Carter we read of Amway's alliances and lawsuits. &quot;....in the pro-Amway 
  camp are well-known Republican politicians, including Ronald Reagan, George 
  Bush, George W. Bush, Oliver North, Newt Gingrich, Woody Jenkins and Sue Myrick. 
  Conservative Christian leaders James Dobson, and formerly Jim and Tammi Bakker 
  have been staunchly pro-Amway, and claim friendships with Amway founders and 
  high-level distributors. Jerry Falwell, who receives massive donations from 
  Amway leaders, has recently issued statements on the internet, and through Amway's 
  voice messaging system, supporting Amway against its critics. Author Charles 
  Paul Conn, president of Lee College, a small Christian college in Cleveland, 
  Tennessee, has written six books about the Amway business, and was a favored

<p>Ed McAteer ~ [See; CNP articles] A former executive for Colgate-Palmolive, 
  Ed took the role of director of the Christian Freedom Foundation upon his retirement. 
  In 1979, he founded and was president of the Religious Roundtable Council of 
  56 , &quot;a coalition of conservative business, military, political, and religious 
  leaders working together to bring Biblical principles into public policy. The 
  Roundtable, in its efforts to influence government, works to politicize the 
  millions of people in the U.S. who believe in &quot;traditional, family-based 
  Christian values.&quot; He is also a member of the Boards of Kim Wickes Ministries 
  (past member of the Roundtable), Wycliffe Bible Associates, and All India Prayer 
  Fellowship. He has been a National Field Director of the Conservative Caucus 
  and also a member of the Editorial board of the Christian Inquirer. In 1975 
  McAteer was an official delegate to the Global Congress on World Evangelism 
  in Lausanne, Switzerland. McAteer is listed in the 1982 Council of National 
  Policy (CNP) as being on the Board of Governors. By 1983 he was on the boards 
  of the Gideons, Teen Challenge, Bill Glass Evangelistic Association, the All-Indian 
  Prayer Fellowship, and the Asian Evangelistic Fellowship. McAteer, a press contact 
  for the Moral Majority, along with Howard Phillips , Richard Viguerie, and Paul 
  Weyrich, helped Jerry Falwell start the Moral Majority. [http://www.pir.org/gw/rrt.txt

<p>Sojourners Magazine is found at http://www.sojo.net/home/magazine/index.cfm 
  &gt; Sojo Net is their web site presence. http://www.sojo.net/home/about_us/index.cfm</p>
<p>Their History from their site, states: Sojourners ministries grew out of the 
  Sojourners Community, located in Southern Columbia Heights, an inner-city neighborhood 
  in Washington, D.C. The community began at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School 
  in Deerfield, Illinois, in the early 1970s when a handful of students began 
  meeting to discuss the relationship between their faith and political issues, 
  particularly the Vietnam War. In 1971, the group decided to create a publication 
  that would express their convictions and test whether other people of faith 
  had similar beliefs. What emerged was an evangelical publication committed to 
  social justice and peace: The Post-American....Sojourners office building houses 
  Sojourners magazine and Call to Renewal, a network of people, churches, and 
  organizations working to overcome poverty. We have provided leadership and support 
  over the years to various other activities including Witness for Peace, the 
  Pledge of Resistance, the Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign, the Free South Africa 
  movement.&quot; http://www.sojo.net/home/about_us/index.cfm/action/history.html</p>
<p>Another source records this about the Sojourners group: &quot;Since 1974 a 
  communal group of 25-35 activists have combined left- liberal, pacifist political 
  activity with a strong dose of evangelical Christianity. In addition to publishing 
  &quot;Sojourners,&quot; they were also behind the &quot;Witness for Peace&quot; 
  program in Nicaragua. Sojourners&quot; began as the People's Christian Coalition 
  in Chicago (1971-1973), which published &quot;Post-American&quot; before moving 
  to Washington. They described themselves as a &quot;chief-less&quot; tribe of 
  &quot;university strike leaders, seminarians, whites, blacks, college students, 
  professors and artists.&quot; It was a cross between the Jesus Movement and 
  the New Left, with the Bible preferred over Marx.&quot; http://www.pir.org/cgi-bin/nbonlin1.cgi/FZ 
</p>
<p>Call to Renewal &gt; http://www.calltorenewal.com&gt; is another ecumenical 
  venture that incorporates politics and the reconstruction of society in it's 
  mission. In their History of the movement, &quot;...The ideological polarization 
  of the churches will not contribute to the spiritual discernment of politics 
  the country most needs. Inflamed rhetoric and name calling is no substitute 
  for real and prayerful dialogue between different constituencies with legitimate 
  concerns and a gospel of love which can bring people together. We are Evangelical 
  voices who seek a biblical approach to politics, not an ideological agenda. 
  We are Catholic voices who assert our own church's social teachings as a vital 
  alternative to both the Left and the Right. We are Orthodox voices who have 
  long stressed the role of spirituality in nurturing culture. We are African 
  American, Latino, white, Asian, and Native American church voices whose commitment 
  to personal faith and social justice leads us to visions of transformation beyond 
  both political parties. We are voices from all the Protestant churches who feel 
  represented neither by old religious liberalism nor new right fundamentalism.</p>
<p>...Politics cannot solve all our problems. Spiritual renewal will be required-of 
  our personal values and communal virtues, of our religious congregations and 
  neighborhood organizations, of our educational institutions and economic enterprises. 
  But genuine spiritual renewal must not be self-righteous or mean-spirited. And 
  spiritual sensitivity must replace ideological predictability as the touchstone 
  of religion in politics. Our definitions of politics must be widened to include 
  new solutions and leadership. In particular, new community-based and value-centered 
  solutions must be found to our seemingly intractable problems. The wall between 
  &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; solutions must come down in favor 
  of new partnerships and configurations that involve everyone. And our religious 
  communities must become meeting places and experimentation grounds where those 
  new solutions are shaped and carried out in partnership with other cultural, 
  economic, and political institutions...&quot;</p>

<p align="left">CHRISTIANS &amp; JEWS URGE PRES. BUSH <br>
  TO BE MINDFUL OF ISRAEL'S <br>
  BIBLICAL ENTITLEMENT<br>
  Fri, 20 Dec 2002 </p>
<p>AS THE &quot;QUARTET&quot; MEETS TODAY - FRIDAY, DEC. 20 - TO DETERMINE THE 
  &quot;ROAD MAP&quot; TO ISRAEL'S FUTURE, CHRISTIANS AND JEWS CAME TOGETHER TO 
  PLACE AN AD IN THE WASHINGTON TIMES, THURSDAY, DEC. 19, DEPLORING THE ARAB TAKE-OVER 
  OF THE HOLY SITES, INCLUDING BETHLEHEM. PLEASE READ AND DISTRIBUTE. </p>
<p>President George W. Bush,</p>
<p>We turn to you at this holy season of the year and ask that you focus attention 
  on the Holy Land of Israel where Christians and Jews are now living under daily 
  threat from Arabs. Christmas in Bethlehem this year provides a sad reminder 
  that the Palestine Authority is still in control of this holy city, and because 
  of its ongoing oppression, the Christian community of Bethlehem has been reduced 
  from a clear majority, to a minority of only 20%. The Times (London): &quot;Life 
  in [PA- ruled] Bethlehem has become insufferable for many members of the dwindling 
  Christian minority. Increasing Muslim-Christian tensions have left some Christians 
  reluctant to celebrate Christmas in the town at the heart of the story of Christ&#146;s 
  birth.&quot; Fatah, Tanzim, PFLP and other terrorists walk freely about the 
  streets while local Christians and pilgrims from overseas stay away from the 
  city, fearing violence. What was once a joyous celebration of the birth of Jesus 
  is now a shadow of its former glory.</p>
<p>The &quot;Road Map&quot; you propose would create two states west of the Jordan 
  River. Under such an arrangement, the following are among the Holy places in 
  the lands the Bible calls Judea and Samaria which would become like Bethlehem:</p>
<p>HEBRON: &quot;Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah 
  facing Mamre, which is Hebron, in the land of Canaan.&quot; &#151; Genesis 23:19</p>
<p>BEIT-EL: &quot;And Jacob dreamt &#133; And the Lord said, &quot;The ground 
  upon which you are lying, to you will I give it and to your descendants &#133; 
  And Jacob named that place Beit-El.&quot; - Genesis 28:12-14</p>
<p>SHILO: Israel&#146;s first capital, where the Ark of the Covenant stood for 
  369 years.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the undersigned were elated by your election because we believed 
  that you would be a leader who would bring honor and pride to America. Our faith 
  has been vindicated. We support your war against terror wholeheartedly, along 
  with its components of strengthening our armed forces and eliminating or imposing 
  controls on rogue governments.</p>
<p>We are very concerned, however, about the administration&#146;s decision to 
  follow a &quot;map&quot; that would surely be harmful to Israel&#146;s well-being, 
  a path that would deny the Jewish people its rightful claims, those derived 
  explicitly from God&#146;s covenant with the Jews: &quot;On that day the Lord 
  made a covenant with Abram and said, &quot;To your descendants I give this land&#133;I 
  will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and 
  your descendants after you. The whole land of Canaan&#133;&quot; - Genesis 15:18, 
  17: 7-8</p>
<p>As a fellow Bible-believer, we are certain that you do not wish your administration 
  to go down in history as one that allowed harm to come to Israel by ignoring 
  scripture. We ask you to rethink a policy that has already brought anguish to 
  the birthplace of Jesus, and would threaten the sanctity of so many other places 
  where Jesus walked.</p>

<p align="center">The Jesus Landing Pad White House Checked With Rapture Christians 
  Before Latest Israel Move<br>
  By Rick Perlstein<br>
  The Village Voice<br>
  5-19-4</p>
<p align="left">It was an e-mail we weren't meant to see. Not for our eyes were 
  the notes that showed White House staffers taking two-hour meetings with Christian 
  fundamentalists, where they passed off bogus social science on gay marriage 
  as if it were holy writ and issued fiery warnings that &quot;the Presidents 
  [sic] Administration and current Government is engaged in cultural, economical, 
  and social struggle on every level&quot; - this to a group whose representative 
  in Israel believed herself to have been attacked by witchcraft unleashed by 
  proximity to a volume of Harry Potter. Most of all, apparently, we're not supposed 
  to know the National Security Council's top Middle East aide consults with apocalyptic 
  Christians eager to ensure American policy on Israel conforms with their sectarian 
  doomsday scenarios. But now we know. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Everything that you're discussing is information you're not supposed to 
  have,&quot; barked Pentecostal minister Robert G. Upton when asked about the 
  off-the-record briefing his delegation received on March 25. Details of that 
  meeting appear in a confidential memo signed by Upton and obtained by the Voice. 
  The e-mailed meeting summary reveals NSC Near East and North African Affairs 
  director Elliott Abrams sitting down with the Apostolic Congress and massaging 
  their theological concerns. Claiming to be &quot;the Christian Voice in the 
  Nation's Capital,&quot; the members vociferously oppose the idea of a Palestinian 
  state. They fear an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza might enable just that, and 
  they object on the grounds that all of Old Testament Israel belongs to the Jews. 
  Until Israel is intact and David's temple rebuilt, they believe, Christ won't 
  come back to earth. Abrams attempted to assuage their concerns by stating that 
  &quot;the Gaza Strip had no significant Biblical influence such as Joseph's 
  tomb or Rachel's tomb and therefore is a piece of land that can be sacrificed 
  for the cause of peace.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Three weeks after the confab, President George W. Bush reversed long-standing 
  U.S. policy, endorsing Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank in exchange 
  for Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip. In an interview with the Voice, 
  Upton denied having written the document, though it was sent out from an e-mail 
  account of one of his staffers and bears the organization's seal, which is nearly 
  identical to the Great Seal of the United States. Its idiosyncratic grammar 
  and punctuation tics also closely match those of texts on the Apostolic Congress's 
  website, and Upton verified key details it recounted, including the number of 
  participants in the meeting (&quot;45 ministers including wives&quot;) and its 
  conclusion &quot;with a heart-moving send-off of the President in his Presidential 
  helicopter.&quot; Upton refused to confirm further details. <br>
  <br>
  Affiliated with the United Pentecostal Church, the Apostolic Congress is part 
  of an important and disciplined political constituency courted by recent Republican 
  administrations. As a subset of the broader Christian Zionist movement, it has 
  a lengthy history of opposition to any proposal that will not result in what 
  it calls a &quot;one-state solution&quot; in Israel. <br>
  <br>
  The White House's association with the congress, which has just posted a new 
  staffer in Israel who may be running afoul of Israel's strict anti-missionary 
  laws, also raises diplomatic concerns. The staffer, Kim Hadassah Johnson, wrote 
  in a report obtained by the Voice, &quot;We are establishing the Meet the Need 
  Fund in Israel - 'MNFI.' ... The fund will be an Interest Free Loan Fund that 
  will enable us to loan funds to new believers (others upon application) who 
  need assistance. They will have the opportunity to repay the loan (although 
  it will not be mandatory).&quot; When that language was read to Moshe Fox, minister 
  for public and interreligious affairs at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, 
  he responded, &quot;It sounds against the law which prohibits any kind of money 
  or material [inducement] to make people convert to another religion. That's 
  what it sounds like.&quot; (Fox's judgment was e-mailed to Johnson, who did 
  not return a request for comment.) <br>
  <br>
  The Apostolic Congress dates its origins to 1981, when, according to its website, 
  &quot;Brother Stan Wachtstetter was able to open the door to Apostolic Christians 
  into the White House.&quot; Apostolics, a sect of Pentecostals, claim legitimacy 
  as the heirs of the original church because they, as the 12 apostles supposedly 
  did, baptize converts in the name of Jesus, not in the name of the Father, Son, 
  and Holy Spirit. Ronald Reagan bore theological affinities with such Christians 
  because of his belief that the world would end in a fiery Armageddon. Reagan 
  himself referenced this belief explicitly a half-dozen times during his presidency. 
  <br>
  <br>
  While the language of apocalyptic Christianity is absent from George W. Bush's 
  speeches, he has proven eager to work with apocalyptics - a point of pride for 
  Upton. &quot;We're in constant contact with the White House,&quot; he boasts. 
  &quot;I'm briefed at least once a week via telephone briefings... I was there 
  about two weeks ago ... At that time we met with the president.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Last spring, after President Bush announced his Road Map plan for peace in the 
  Middle East, the Apostolic Congress co-sponsored an effort with the Jewish group 
  Americans for a Safe Israel that placed billboards in 23 cities with a quotation 
  from Genesis (&quot;Unto thy offspring will I give this land&quot;) and the 
  message, &quot;Pray that President Bush Honors God's Covenant with Israel. Call 
  the White House with this message.&quot; It then provided the White House phone 
  number and the Apostolic Congress's Web address. <br>
  <br>
  In the interview with the Voice, Pastor Upton claimed personal responsibility 
  for directing 50,000 postcards to the White House opposing the Road Map, which 
  aims to create a Palestinian state. &quot;I'm in total disagreement with any 
  form of Palestinian state,&quot; Upton said. &quot;Within a two-week period, 
  getting 50,000 postcards saying the exact same thing from places all over the 
  country, that resonated with the White House. That really caused [President 
  Bush] to backpedal on the Road Map.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  When I sought to confirm Upton's account of the meeting with the White House, 
  I was directed to National Security Council spokesman Frederick Jones, whose 
  initial response upon being read a list of the names of White House staffers 
  present was a curt, &quot;You know half the people you just mentioned are Jewish?&quot; 
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked for comment on top White House staffers meeting with representatives 
  of an organization that may be breaking Israeli law, Jones responded, &quot;Why 
  would the White House comment on that?&quot; When asked whose job it is in the 
  administration to study the Bible to discern what parts of Israel were or weren't 
  acceptable sacrifices for peace, Jones said that his previous statements had 
  been off-the-record. <br>
  <br>
  When Pastor Upton was asked to explain why the group's website describes the 
  Apostolic Congress as &quot;the Christian Voice in the nation's capital,&quot; 
  instead of simply a Christian voice in the nation's capital, he responded, &quot;There 
  has been a real lack of leadership in having someone emerge as a Christian voice, 
  someone who doesn't speak for the right, someone who doesn't speak for the left, 
  but someone who speaks for the people, and someone who speaks from a theocratical 
  perspective.&quot; <br>
  When his words were repeated back to him to make sure he had said a &quot;theocratical&quot; 
  perspective, not a &quot;theological&quot; perspective, he said, &quot;Exactly. 
  Exactly. We want to know what God would have us say or what God would have us 
  do in every issue.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The Middle East was not the only issue discussed at the March 25 meeting. James 
  Wilkinson, deputy national security advisor for communications, spoke first 
  and is characterized as stating that the 9-11 Commission &quot;is portraying 
  those who have given their all to protect this nation as 'weak on terrorism,' 
  &quot; that &quot;99 percent of all the men and women protecting us in this 
  fight against terrorism are career citizens,&quot; and offered the example of 
  Frances Townsend, deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism, 
  &quot;who sacrificed Christmas to do a 'security video' conference.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Tim Goeglein, deputy director of public liaison and the White House's point 
  man with evangelical Christians, moderated, and he also spoke on the issue of 
  same-sex marriage. According to the memo, he asked the rhetorical questions: 
  &quot;What will happen to our country if that actually happens? What do those 
  pushing such hope to gain?&quot; His answer: &quot;They want to change America.&quot; 
  How so? He quoted the research of Hoover Institute senior fellow Stanley Kurtz, 
  who holds that since gay marriage was legalized in Scandinavia, marriage itself 
  has virtually ceased to exist. (In fact, since Sweden instituted a registered-partnership 
  law for same-sex couples in the mid '90s, there has been no overall change in 
  the marriage and divorce rates there.) It is Matt Schlapp, White House political 
  director and Karl Rove's chief lieutenant, who was paraphrased as stating &quot;that 
  the Presidents Administration and current Government is engaged in cultural, 
  economical, and social struggle on every level.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Also present at the meeting was Kristen Silverberg, deputy assistant to the 
  president for domestic policy. (None of the participants responded to interview 
  requests.) <br>
  <br>
  The meeting was closed by Goeglein, who was asked, &quot;What can we do to assist 
  in this fight for these issues and our nations [sic] foundation and values?&quot; 
  and who reportedly responded, &quot;Pray, pray, pray, pray.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The Apostolic Congress's representative in Israel, Kim Johnson, is ethnically 
  Jewish, keeps kosher, and holds herself to the sumptuary standards of Orthodox 
  Jewish women, so as to better blend in to her surroundings. In one letter home 
  obtained by the Voice she notes that many of the Apostolic Christians she works 
  with in Israel are Filipino women &quot;married to Jewish men - who on occasion 
  accompany their wives to meetings. We are planning to start a fellowship with 
  this select group where we can meet for dinners and get to know one another. 
  Please Pray for the timing and formation of such.&quot; Elsewhere she talks 
  of a discussion with someone &quot;on the pitfalls and aggravations of Christians 
  who missionize Jews.&quot; She works often among the Jewish poor - the kind 
  of people who might be interested in interest-free loans - and is thrilled to 
  &quot;meet the outcasts of this Land - how wonderful because they are in the 
  in-casts for His Kingdom.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  An ecstatic figure who from her own reports appears to operate at the edge of 
  sanity (&quot;Two of the three nights in my apartment I have been attacked by 
  a hair raising spirit of fear,&quot; she writes, noting the sublet contained 
  a Harry Potter book; &quot;at this time I am associating it with witchcraft&quot;), 
  Johnson has also met with Knesset member Gila Gamliel. (Gamliel did not respond 
  to interview requests.) She also boasted of an imminent meeting with a &quot;Knesset 
  leader.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;At this point and for all future mails it is important for me to note 
  that this country has very stiff anti-missionary laws,&quot; she warns the followers 
  back home. [D]iscretion is required in all mails. This is particularly important 
  to understand when people write mails or ask about organization efforts regarding 
  such.&quot; Her boss, Pastor Upton, displays a photograph on the Apostolic Congress 
  website of a meeting between himself and Beny Elon, Prime Minister Sharon's 
  tourism minister, famous in Israel for his advocacy of the expulsion of Palestinians 
  from Israeli-controlled lands. His spokesman in the U.S., Ronn Torassian, affirmed 
  that &quot;Minister Elon knows Mr. Upton well,&quot; but when asked whether 
  he is aware that Mr. Upton's staffer may be breaking Israel's anti-missionary 
  laws, snapped: &quot;It's not something he's interested in discussing with The 
  Village Voice.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  In addition to its work in Israel, the Apostolic Congress is part of the increasingly 
  Christian public face of pro-Israel activities in the United States. Don Wagner, 
  author of the book Anxious for Armageddon, has been studying Christian Zionism 
  for 15 years, and believes that the current hard-line pro-Israel movement in 
  the U.S. is &quot;predominantly gentile.&quot; Often, devotees work in concert 
  with Jewish groups like Americans for a Safe Israel, or AFSI, which set up a 
  mostly Christian Committee for a One-State Solution as the sponsor of last year's 
  billboard campaign. The committee's board included, in addition to Upton, such 
  evangelical luminaries as Gary Bauer and E.E. &quot;Ed&quot; McAteer of the 
  Religious Roundtable. <br>
  <br>
  AFSI's executive director, Helen Freedman, confirms the increasingly Christian 
  cast of her coalition. &quot;We have many good Jews, of course,&quot; she says, 
  &quot;but they're in the minority.&quot; She adds, &quot;The liberal Jew is 
  unable to believe the Arab when he says his goal is to Islamize the West... 
  But I believe it. And evangelical Christians believe it.&quot; Of Jews who might 
  otherwise support her group's view of Jews' divine right to Israel, she laments, 
  &quot;They're embarrassed about quoting the Bible, about referring to the Covenant, 
  about talking about the Promised Land.&quot; </p>
<p>Pastor Upton is not embarrassed, and Helen Freedman is proud of her association 
  with him. She is wistful when asked if she, like Upton, has been able to finagle 
  a meeting with the president. &quot;Pastor Upton is the head of a whole Apostolic 
  Congress,&quot; she laments. &quot;It's a nationwide group of evangelicals.&quot; 
  Upton has something Freedman covets: a voting bloc. <br>
  <br>
  She laughs off concerns that, for Christian Zionists, actual Jews living in 
  Israel serve as mere props for their end-time scenario: &quot;We have a different 
  conception of what [the end of the world] will be like ... Whoever is right 
  will rejoice, and whoever was wrong will say, 'Whoops!' &quot; <br>
  <br>
  She's not worried, either, about evangelical anti-Semitism: &quot;I don't think 
  it exists,&quot; she says. She does say, however, that it would concern her 
  if she learned the Apostolic Congress had a representative in Israel trying 
  to win converts: &quot;If we discovered that people were trying to convert Jews 
  to Christianity, we would be very upset.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Kim Johnson doesn't call it converting Jews to Christianity. She calls it &quot;Circumcision 
  of the Heart&quot; - a spiritual circumcision Jews must undergo because, she 
  writes in paraphrase of Jeremiah, chapter 9, &quot;God will destroy all the 
  uncircumcised nations along with the House of Israel, because the House of Israel 
  is uncircumcised in the heart ... [I]t is through the Gospel ... that men's 
  hearts are circumcised.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Apostolics believe that only 144,000 Jews who have not, prior to the Second 
  Coming of Christ, acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah will be saved in the end 
  times. Though even for those who do not believe in this literal interpretation 
  of the Bible - or for anyone who lives in Israel, or who cares about Israel, 
  or whose security might be affected by a widespread conflagration in the Middle 
  East, which is everyone - the scriptural prophecies of the Christian Zionists 
  should be the least of their worries. Instead, we should be worried about self-fulfilling 
  prophecies. &quot;Biblically,&quot; stated one South Carolina minister in support 
  of the anti-Road Map billboard campaign, &quot;there's always going to be a 
  war.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Don Wagner, an evangelical, worries that in the Republican Party, people who 
  believe this &quot;are dominating the discourse now, in an election year.&quot; 
  He calls the attempt to yoke Scripture to current events &quot;a modern heresy, 
  with cultish proportions. &quot;I mean, it's appalling,&quot; he rails on. &quot;And 
  it also shows how marginalized mainstream Christian thinking, and the majority 
  of evangelical thought, have become.&quot; It demonstrates, he says, &quot;the 
  absolute convergence of the neoconservatives with the Christian Zionists and 
  the pro-Israel lobby, driving U.S. Mideast policy.&quot; The problem is not 
  that George W. Bush is discussing policy with people who press right-wing solutions 
  to achieve peace in the Middle East, or with devout Christians. It is that he 
  is discussing policy with Christians who might not care about peace at all - 
  at least until the rapture. <br>
  <br>
  The Jewish pro-Israel lobby, in the interests of peace for those living in the 
  present, might want to consider a disengagement. <br>

  What is really sad about these evangelical yahoo's is that they are utterly 
  blind to the meaning of the prophets they lay claim to! &quot;The Promised Land&quot; 
  was nothing more than a living picture in history, drawn out by God through 
  a people, to symbolize something greater and spiritual -- the Kingdom of God. 
  Not a piece of physical property or real estate! This is even explained plainly 
  in the New Testament, but goes utterly ignored by them.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he 
    should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing 
    whither he went. <br>
    9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling 
    in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: 
    <br>
    10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker 
    is God. <br>
    11 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and 
    was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful 
    who had promised. <br>
    12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as 
    the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore 
    innumerable. <br>
    13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen 
    them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed 
    that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. <br>
    14 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. 
    <br>
    15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came 
    out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. <br>
    16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God 
    is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.&quot; 
    (Hebrews 11:8-16)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have missed the boat completely on the meaning of the New Jerusalem and 
  God's Israel. And I have no doubts its deliberate and for the same, sick, pocket-lining, 
  power-now, ego-based sinful reasons the Pharisees did it. I have no doubts these 
  very men would be the first to convince the world that the coming Christ was 
  the enemy. We are told in the Revelation and the Gospels that Christ's second 
  coming will be preceded by a sign in the heavens; Jesus appears to suggest in 
  Matthew 24 that this sign will be his literal coming, from heaven, upon the 
  clouds of the sky -- but before that, heralded by a great sign in the heavens. 
  Could this be his very approach to the planet itself? Then we are told in the 
  Revelation that 'the Beast' will gather all the armies of the world to one place, 
  to do battle and make war with &quot;the Lamb&quot; (the coming Christ). That 
  place he gathers them is called Armageddon, and it is a specific, geographical 
  location north of Jerusalem in Israel, in the land of Edom and Moab. I can just 
  see these weasels telling their millions of Christian followers that the spectacle 
  in the heavens is an alien invasion of Satanic entities. It wouldn't surprise 
  me a bit if someone like Bush has been convinced he is some pivotal character 
  in the last days scenario.</p>

<p>You Cant' Lie To God<br>
  Yet Most American Christians And Jews Lie About Iraq, Islam, And Themselves<br>
  By John Kaminski<br>

  The Tibetan Book of the Dead (Evans-Wentz version) is one of my favorite books. 
  It describes how after death our souls pass through a place called the bardo, 
  and after reviewing every event that has happened in our lives through conversations 
  and confrontations with apparitions called the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities, 
  we either evolve into pure light or choose the time and place of our next reappearance 
  on this physical plane. </p>
<p>I am not a believer in reincarnation. So it took me awhile to realize that 
  this ancient ritual prescription is more about life than it is about death. 
  We carry the memories of every bad thing we've ever done in this life with us, 
  and when we die, these thoughtless transgressions are going to come back to 
  bother us. Which makes it a lot better to confront those episodes long before 
  we breathe our last. You know, beat the rush! Make those last moments more comfortable, 
  because when you think about it, we really live our lives in order to have our 
  deaths be the best, most enlightening experience of our lives. I mean, nobody 
  has an utterly clean slate after very many years of life, but having confronted 
  one's own faults prior to the moment of big sleep will at least make that last 
  closing of the eyes a lot more peaceful. <br>
</p>
<p>It was in this vein I was chatting with a friend the other day about the sundry 
  forms of religion in the world, many of which seem hateful skeletons of what 
  a fully functional, compassionate and healthful human being should be. Of course 
  it was the vengeful, superficial brand of religion espoused by the current U.S. 
  president that set our tongues to wagging. George W. Bush is fond of saying 
  how he talks to God every day, and God tells him which country to invade, which 
  innocent people to slaughter from the air with his high-tech weaponry, and presumably, 
  which multinational corporations upon whom to bestow his ill-gotten gains. Bush's 
  brand of religion is endorsed by a larger audience of American evangelical Bible-thumpers, 
  many of whom advocate the death penalty for such human subgroups as homosexuals, 
  peaceniks and all those who don't accept the fire-and-brimstone version of their 
  Christian holy book. <br>
</p>
<p>In our conversation, my friend, shaking her head at all these punitive pronouncements 
  so popular among those who seek to get everyone else to believe the way they 
  do, brought up Catholic confession, and noted that at least Catholics are made 
  to verbally confess their sins on a regular basis to help keep them living honest 
  lives. But as far as the bizarre belief that some people, including Catholics 
  and George W. Bush (among millions of others), have special insight as to what 
  &quot;God&quot; really said, nothing these days tops for sheer sickness the 
  relationship between the Jews of Israel and the evangelical Christians of the 
  United States, all of whom are collectively known as Zionists. This special 
  relationship, which is behind what is perhaps the most heartless and destructive 
  political philosophy of all time (the policy of pre-emptive war), links Jews 
  and Christians in a downright pathological bond in which the two pretend to 
  be philosophical allies while underneath the surface each is working and praying 
  for the utter destruction of the other group. <br>
</p>
<p>The Christian evangelicals support Israel because it fits their fixated belief 
  that their messiah will only return if Israel is controlled by the Jews. However, 
  when their messiah returns, they believe he will destroy the entire Jewish population, 
  or at least those who don't instantly accept Christ as their savior. The cynical 
  Jews, on the other hand, don't really care what the Zionist Christians think, 
  because they don't believe in Christ at all and are merely contented by the 
  political and financial support brought to them by a group they consider subhuman, 
  but politically important. This is truly a match made in hell, the forging of 
  a powerful coalition of lunatics who together aim to turn the world into a smoldering 
  cinder merely to fulfill their own mutually exclusive and insane desires. <br>
</p>
<p>So, getting back to the conversation with my friend, she insisted that some 
  people, when push comes to shove, actually try to lie to God, because their 
  egos are so big, and their religion is merely something they use a badge of 
  social status and acceptance. These people, she insisted, merely use the concept 
  of God for their own psychological aggrandizement, and because they are willing 
  to lie to God, they certainly are willing to lie to their families, friends 
  and everybody to achieve their own selfish objectives. <br>
  I let this percolate around in my mind for awhile, and then vehemently (or as 
  strenuously as you can be when you love someone and disagree with them) objected 
  to her characterization that people, in their last moments of life, would actually 
  try to lie to God. <br>
  Maybe it's because I've led a somewhat sheltered life. For instance, I've never, 
  like so many Iraqi and Palestinian families, had a loved one shot to death by 
  a soulless enemy right in front my eyes. Or like a Hutu or a Tutsi, I've never 
  seen one of my children hacked to death by someone who can't explain why he's 
  doing what he's doing. Or, like an Afghani or a Serb, I've never seen one of 
  my children born with grotesque external tumors on his face because someone 
  had bombed my neighborhood with poisonous radioactive ammunition. I've led a 
  sheltered, coddled, relatively affluent American life, for which I constantly 
  give thanks to God and many others for my good luck. <br>
</p>
<p>But the idea that, at the final moment of death, someone would actually lie 
  to God as they enter the infinite realm of dark shadows is just beyond my comprehension. 
  How could anyone, faced with the freighted moment of their final departure from 
  this life, tell a lie to an all-encompassing being who knows the truth about 
  everything? What kind of delusional indoctrination could make somebody attempt 
  something so ludicrously impossible? Then I began to re-examine all these hateful 
  things that so-called religious people are constantly saying. I have long held 
  the belief that the people you can trust least are religious people, because 
  they use their divine excuses to refute reason in any and all situations. The 
  current U.S. demolition of Iraq provides a clear example. We are going to bomb 
  these innocent people into submission so they can have freedom. What is wrong 
  with this picture? <br>
</p>
<p>It is high time for people of good conscience to ignore the dictates of their 
  so-called spiritual leaders and abandon their churches, if they continue to 
  preach divine retribution for what is clearly a case of robbery and mass murder 
  cloaked in noble rhetoric. <br>
  And it is time for all Americans to turn on their murderous government and support 
  freedom for the Iraqi people against the shocking sexual perversions of the 
  U.S. government. That's right - only perverts and moral criminals support what 
  the U.S. is doing in Iraq. <br>
</p>
<p>What is right is right, and the U.S. attack on Iraq is clearly wrong - immoral, 
  inhumane, ignorant and against every single word a truly just God would ever 
  utter through those who pretend to be his bewitched human interpreters. The 
  same goes for Christian and Jewish pronouncements against Islam. Muhammad wrote 
  that worshippers of other religions should be protected against discrimination, 
  and their shrines protected. That makes Islam morally superior to both Christianity 
  and Judaism, whose commonly held holy books (i.e, the Old Testament) endlessly 
  preach destruction, murder, and robbery against all those who won't accept their 
  evil version of ancient events. <br>
</p>
<p>To all Christians, I say: how can you accept as your messiah a cynical, figmented 
  construct not verifiable in history who was invented by a Jewish rabbi who changed 
  his name from Saul to Paul? And to all Jews I say: your God is Moloch, who values 
  money and power over compassion and respect. Anyone who thinks their subgroup 
  is supernaturally superior to all others is bound to be destroyed by the resentful 
  retribution of the masses. It's only a matter of time. In this respect, both 
  Christians and Jews worship an evil God. All of you will suffer eternal torment 
  when you die for failure to use both your brain and your heart to a minimal 
  extent. If you believe God put us here, it had to be for us to use our brains 
  and our hearts to protect and nurture this wonderful garden he gave us to thrive 
  in. <br>
</p>
<p>Getting back to the subject of lying to God, I switch now to another Book of 
  the Dead, the Egyptian one, the actual title of which is &quot;The Book of Going 
  Forth by Day,&quot; for a much more intelligent and functional description of 
  what happens to you when you die, and how you should really live your life (if 
  you need to be religious at all, and sooner or later, most of us do)...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac4.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p> When you die, you go before the Goddess Ma'at and your soul is put on a scale 
  and weighed against the Feather of Truth. If your unforgiven sins reveal that 
  your soul is no heavier that that single feather, then your soul is allowed 
  to travel blissfully through the Field of Reeds and across the River of Truth 
  to the Island of the Just, where it will repose in peace forever. But if it 
  is found to be heavier than the Feather of Truth, your soul is fed to Thoth's 
  dog! (Think very big teeth.) I'm sure you will agree with me that in this sad 
  day and age of war and lies that the gurgling hordes of human souls on this 
  planet - those who believe you can lie to God by using the hateful phrases of 
  warped preachers who are far more interested in property than propriety - are 
  just so much dogfood.</p>
