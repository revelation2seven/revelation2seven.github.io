    The Name. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The name &quot;tanna&quot; 
    is derived from the Aramaic &quot;teni&quot; or &quot;tena&quot; (=&quot;to 
    teach&quot;), and designates in general a teacher of the oral law, and in 
    particular one of the sages of the Mishnah, those teachers of the oral law 
    whose teachings are contained in the Mishnah and in the Baraita. The term 
    was first used in the Gemara to indicate a teacher mentioned in the Mishnah 
    or in a baraita, in contradistinction to the later authorities, the Amoraim. 
    Not all the teachers of the oral law who are mentioned in the Mishnah are 
    called tannaim, however, but only those belonging to the period BEGINNING 
    WITH THE DISCIPLES OF SHAMMAI AND HILEL AND ENDING WITH THE CONTEMPORARIES 
    OF JUDAH HE-NASI. The authorities preceding that period are called &quot;ze?enim 
    ha-rishonim&quot; (the former elders). In the time of the Amoraim the name 
    &quot;tanna&quot; was given also to one well versed in the Mishnah and the 
    other tannaitic traditions.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The period of the 
    Tannaim, which lasted about 210 years (10-220 C.E.), is generally divided 
    by Jewish scholars into five or six sections or generations, the purpose of 
    such division being to show which teachers developed their principal activity 
    contemporaneously. Some of the tannaim, however, were active in more than 
    one generation. The following is an enumeration of the six generations and 
    of the more prominent tannaim respectively belonging to them:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First Generation (10-80 C.E.):</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Principal tannaim: 
    the Shammaites (Bet Shammai) and the Hillelites (Bet Hillel), 'A?abya b. Mahalaleel, 
    Rabban Gamaliel the Elder, ?anina, chief of the priests (&quot;segan ha-kohanim&quot;), 
    Simeon b. Gamaliel, and JOHANAN B. ZAKKAI.</font></p>

    ELIEZER B. HYRCANUS, Joshua b. Hananiah, Eleazar b. Azariah, Judah b. Bathyra.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third Generation (120-140): </font></p>

    ?arfon, Ishmael, Akiba, Johanan b. Nuri, Jose ha-Gelili, Simeon b. Nanos, 
    Judah b. Baba, and Johanan b. Baro?a. Several of these flourished in the preceding 
    period.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fourth Generation: </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This generation extended 
    from the death of Akiba (c. 140) to that of the patriarch Simeon b. Gamaliel 
    (c. 165). The teachers belonging to this generation were: Me&iuml;r, Judah 
    b. Ilai, Jose b. ?alafta, SIMEON B. YOHAI, Eleazar b. Shammua, Johanan ha-Sandalar, 
    Eleazar b. Jacob, Nehemiah, Joshua b. ?ar?a, and the above-mentioned Simeon 
    b. Gamaliel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fifth Generation (165-200): </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Principal tannaim: 
    Nathan ha-Babli, Symmachus, Judah ha-Nasi I., Jose b. Judah, Eleazar b. Simeon, 
    Simeon b. Eleazar.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sixth Generation (200-220): </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To this generation 
    belong the contemporaries and disciples of Judah ha-Nasi. They are mentioned 
    in the Tosefta and the Baraita but not in the Mishnah. Their names are: Polemo, 
    Issi b. Judah, Eleazar b. Jose, Ishmael b. Jose, Judah b. La?ish, ?iyya, A?a, 
    Abba (Arika). These teachers are termed &quot;semi-tannaim&quot;; and therefore 
    some scholars count only five generations of tannaim. Christian scholars, 
    moreover, count only four generations, reckoning the second and third as one 
    (Strack, &quot;Einleitung in den Talmud,&quot; pp. 77 et seq.).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following list 
    </font>(not included here)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> enumerates 
    all the ze?enim harishonim, tannaim, and amoraim mentioned in the Talmudic-Midrashic 
    literature, those who are well known and frequently mentioned as well as those 
    whose names occur once only in the Mishnah and Tosefta or in the Talmud and 
    Midrash. To this pretannaitic period belong the so-called &quot;pairs&quot; 
    (&quot;zugot&quot;) of teachers: SIMEON THE JUST and Antigonus of Soko; Jose 
    ben Joezer and Jose ben Johanan; Joshua ben Pera?yah and Nittai of Arbela; 
    Judah ben Tabbai and Simeon ben She?a?; Shemaiah and Abtalion; Hillel and 
    Shammai.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Our contention here is that the merkabah doctrines 
    of the Essenes--those that gave birth to Christianity--were secretly carried 
    over to the Pharisees (to those on the Lunar side of the oracles) in the name 
    of John the son of Zachariah ( John the Baptist the original Johanan b. Zakkai), 
    and that these teachings then forth among the <i>Tannaim</i> not merely under 
    that name but by some anonymous individual (or individuals) who adopted the 
    name to themself. And that they were carried there by Simon bar Jonah (and 
    others such as Eliezer b. Hyrcanus), whose ministry was directly to the Circumcision, 
    and who was also the original Simeon bar Yochai (the disciple of Yochanan). 
    Again, the name passed into the Judaic stream of thought and was either taken 
    up by another (a later Schimon b. Yochai), or taken out of its historic context 
    by others later on, and inserted in the list of tannaim <i>after </i> Akiba, 
    and that to lend further credence to the teachings of Akiba which were in 
    question by others. Please keep in mind, Akiba said that Bar Kochba was the 
    messiah. The words attributed to Simeon b. Yochai in the Zohar centuries later 
    could only have been uttered by one who <i>knew</i> the mystery.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">And we hold that the excommunicated Elisha ben 
    Abuyah is none other than Christianity's Paul, who followed John the Baptist--the 
    spirit of Elijah in his time--in the historical framework of the hidden oracles:</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most important 
    tanna in the last decade of the Second Temple, and, after the destruction 
    of Jerusalem, the founder and first president of the academy at Jabneh. According 
    to the theory formulated in the Mishnah (Ab. ii. 8), that traditions were 
    handed down through an unbroken chain of scholars, Johanan, in receiving the 
    teachings of Hillel and Shammai, formed the last link in that chain. But it 
    is rather as a pupil of Hillel than of Shammai that he is known (Suk. 28a). 
    Before his death Hillel is said to have prophetically designated Johanan, 
    his youngest pupil, as &quot;the father of wisdom&quot; and &quot;the father 
    of coming generations&quot; (Yer. Ned. v., end, 39b). Like that of Hillel, 
    Johanan's life was divided into periods of forty years each. In the first 
    of these he followed a mercantile pursuit; in the second he studied; and in 
    the third he taught (R. H. 30b). Another version has it (Sifre, Deut. 357) 
    that in the last forty years of his life he was a leader of Israel. If the 
    last statement be accepted as approximately correct, and it is assumed that 
    Johanan lived at the latest one decade after the destruction of Jerusalem, 
    his public activity as the recognized leader of the pharisaic scribes must 
    have begun between the years 30 and 40 of the common era. </font>(Right at 
    the time as these doctrines were coming over and being committed in secret 
    measure to the Pharisees)</p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Activity Before Destruction 
    of Temple. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some data have been 
    preserved concerning Johanan's public activity in Jerusalem before the destruction 
    of the Temple. Together with Simon b. Gamaliel I. he sent orders to the different 
    districts of Palestine concerning the delivery of the tithe (statement of 
    his pupil Joshua b. Netunya in the Mekilta of Simeon b. Yochai; Midr. ha-Gadol 
    to Deut. xxvi. 13). He refuted the objections of the Sadducees to the Pharisees 
    (Yad. iv. 5), and opposed the halakah of the Sadducees (Men. 65a; B. B. 115b). 
    He prevented a Sadducean high priest from following the Sadducean regulations 
    at the burning of the red heifer (Tosef., Parah, iii. 8; comp. Parah iii. 
    7, 8). It was Johanan's activity as a teacher in Jerusalem which was especially 
    extolled by tradition. HIS SCHOOL WAS CALLED THE &quot;GREAT HOUSE,&quot; 
    after the expression in II Kings xxv. 9 (Yer. Meg. 73d). It was the scene 
    of many incidents THAT FORMED THE SUBJECTS OF ANECDOTE AND LEGEND (Lam. R. 
    i. 12, passim; Gen. R. iv.). The oft-repeated story concerning JOHANNAN'S 
    MOST IMPORTANT PUPIL, ELIEZER B. HYRCANUS, shows Johanan's bet ha-midrash 
    (academy) as the scene of a pathetic meeting between son and father (Tan., 
    ed. Buber, to Gen. xiv. 1). An old tradition (Pes. 26a) relates that Johanan 
    sat in the shadow of the Temple and lectured the whole day; but that of course 
    was not the permanent place for his teaching. The statements regarding five 
    of his pupils, his verdict concerning them, and the question he put to them 
    as to the best road for a person to pursue through life (Ab. ii. 8) are reminiscences 
    of the period before the destruction.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Residence IN GALILEE.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Johanan's residence 
    in 'Arab, a place in Galilee, which was perhaps his home, belongs to this 
    period. Two questions of a legal nature (regarding the observance of the Sabbath) 
    which he answered while there (Shab. xvi. 7, xxii. 3) gave rise to the statement 
    that he lived there for eighteen years (probably a round number) and that 
    he was moved by the religious indifference of the inhabitants to exclaim: 
    &quot;O Galilee, Galilee, thou hatest the Torah; HENCE WILT THOU FALL INTO 
    THE HANDS OF ROBBERS!&quot; Another prophetical exclamation of a similar nature 
    is ascribed to Johanan. THE GATES OF THE TEMPLE HAD OMINOUSLY OPENED OF THEMSELVES, 
    whereupon he apostrophized the sanctuary: &quot;O Temple, Temple, why dost 
    thou frighten thyself? I KNOW OF THEE THAT THOU SHALT BE DESTROYED... ZECHARIAH 
    the son of Iddo [Zech. xi. 1] HAS ALREADY PROPHESIED CONCERNING THEE: 'Open 
    thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars'&quot; (Yoma 39b; 
    comp. Ab. R. N., Recension B, vii., ed. Schechter, p. 21).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the Destruction.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Johanan's part in 
    the last struggle of Jerusalem against Rome has been immortalized in the legends 
    concerning the destruction of that city, which, however, have a historical 
    kernel (Gi?. 56b; Lam. R. i. 5; Ab. R. N. iv.). He counseled peace; and when 
    the strife of parties in the besieged city became unbearable he had himself 
    carried to the Roman camp in a coffin. Like Josephus, Johanan prophesied imperial 
    honors for the general Vespasian, quoting the words of the prophet Isaiah: 
    &quot;LEBANON [that is, the sanctuary] SHALL FALL BY A MIGHTY ONE&quot; (Isa.x. 
    34). He sought and obtained permission to settle in Jabneh (Jamnia) and to 
    exercise his profession of teacher there. In Jabneh, surrounded by his pupils, 
    Johanan received the terrible news that the Temple was burned to ashes. They 
    tore their garments, wept, and made lamentation as for the dead (Ab. R. N. 
    iv.). But the aged master in the catastrophe which had befallen the Jewish 
    people kept his vigor unimpaired. He converted the school at Jabneh into a 
    center for Judaism in Palestine. The college, of which he was president, exercised 
    the functions of the great law court (Sanhedrin) of Jerusalem, and by this 
    institution of an authorized board the continuity of spiritual leadership 
    was maintained uninterrupted. Johanan saw to it that Jabneh took the place 
    of Jerusalem as the Jewish religious center. He ordained that certain privileges 
    peculiar to Jerusalem and the sanctuary should be transferred to Jabneh (R. 
    H. iv. 1, 3). Other regulations of his dealt with the determination of the 
    exact time when the new month begins&#151;a matter then very important&#151;and 
    with the acceptance of the testimony on which such determination is based 
    (ib. iv. 41; Baraita, R. H. 21b). His order that, as had been customary in 
    the Temple, the trumpets should sound in Jabneh on New-Year's Day even when 
    it fell on the Sabbath, was opposed, but unsuccessfully, by some of the members 
    of the council (Baraita, R. H. 29b).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not known how 
    long Johanan remained at the head of the bet ha-midrash and of the legal council. 
    It may be accepted as certain that Johanan was succeeded by Gamaliel II. while 
    the former was still living, inasmuch as he did not die in Jabneh; for it 
    is related (Eccl. R. vii. 7; comp. Ab. R. N. xiv.) that his pupils went to 
    Jabneh after his death. And furthermore, since a place, Berur ?ayil, is mentioned 
    as the seat of a legal council over which Johanan presided (Sanh. 32b; Sifre, 
    Deut. 144), and at another time it is related that Joshua b. Hananiah visited 
    his teacher in Berur ?ayil (Tosef., Ma'aser al-Rishon, i. 1), it may be concluded 
    that Johanan spent the last years of his life and died at this place, which 
    was near Jabneh (concerning the name comp. Krauss's conjecture in Berliner's 
    &quot;Magazin,&quot; xx. 119; Derenbourg, in &quot;Monatsschrift,&quot; xxxvii. 
    304). His pupils were present at his death. The solemn conversation between 
    the dying master and his disciples (Ber. 28b) begins with a question from 
    the latter: &quot;LIGHT OF ISRAEL, PILLAR OF THE SANCTUARY, STRONG HAMMER, 
    why dost thou weep?&quot; These remarkable epithets characterize the work 
    of Johanan and his importance for his period. The blessing which just before 
    his death he pronounced upon his pupils at their desire consisted of the prayer: 
    &quot;May it be God's will that the fear of heaven be as strong in you as 
    the fear of flesh and blood&quot; (ib.). His last words were: &quot;Put the 
    vessels out of the house, that they may not become unclean, AND PREPARE A 
    THRONE FOR HEZEKIAH, THE KING OF JUDAH, WHO IS COMING&quot; (ib.). By this 
    puzzling reference to Hezekiah, Johanan plainly meant the coming of the Messiah, 
    of which he was thinking in his last moments. A son of Johanan died before 
    him (Ab. R. N. xiv., end). In one &agrave;necdote (B. B. 10b) his sister's 
    sons are mentioned. One of these nephews, Ben Ba?ia?, is named as one of the 
    Zealot leaders (Lam. R. to i. 4; Jew. Encyc. ii. 673).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His Teaching.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Johanan ben Zakkai's 
    motto was, &quot;If thou hast learned much of the Torah, do not take credit 
    for it; for this was the purpose of thy creation&quot; (Ab. ii. 8). He found 
    his real calling in the study of the Law. The following description of him 
    was handed down by tradition (Suk. 28a): &quot;He never spoke an idle word; 
    he did not go four yards without reflecting on the Torah and without the phylacteries; 
    no one ever preceded him in entering the bet ha-midrash; he never slept in 
    the bet ha-midrash, and was always the last to leave it; no one ever found 
    him engaged in anything but study.&quot; His knowledge was spoken of as though 
    it included the whole of Jewish learning (Ab. R. N. xiv., end; Suk. 28a; B. 
    B. 134a; Masseket Soferim xvi. 8). He advises a priestly family in Jerusalem, 
    the members of which died young, to occupy itself with the study of the Torah 
    so as to ward off the curse of dying in the prime of life, which is laid upon 
    the descendants of Eli (from whom they may have descended) in I Sam. ii. 23 
    (R. H. 18a). He, however, warned against a one-sided devotion to study, as 
    in his verdict concerning scholars and those free of sin: &quot;Whoever possesses 
    both these characteristics at the same time is like an artist who has his 
    tools in his hands&quot; (Ab. R. N. xxii.). (see image) Traditional Tomb of 
    Johanan ben Zakkai, near Tiberias, with the Grave of Maimonides to the Right.(From 
    a photograph by Dr. W. Popper.)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His Exegesis.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the halakic tradition 
    JOHANAN IS BUT SELDOM REFERRED TO AS AN ORIGINATOR OF MAXIMS. His halakah 
    is doubtless to be found in that of Hillel's school and in the sayings of 
    his pupils, especially of Eliezer and Joshua. The haggadic tradition, on the 
    other hand, connects numerous and varied sayings with his name. Mention may 
    first be made of conversations between him and his pupils, or between him 
    and unbelievers who were versed in the Bible, in which questions of textual 
    interpretation were discussed. At one time he asked his pupils what the words 
    in Prov. xiv. 34 meant (Pesi?., ed. Buber, 12b; comp. B. B. 10b, where the 
    accounts of two conversations have been confused). He himself interpreted 
    them as follows: &quot;Benevolence [HESED] on the part of a nation has the 
    atoning power of a sin-offering&quot; (B. B. l.c.). In the same sense he interpreted 
    the words of the prophet (Hosea vi. 6), &quot;I desired mercy [HESED], and 
    not sacrifice,&quot; with which he comforted his pupils for the destruction 
    of the Temple and the discontinuance of the sacrifice of atonement (Ab. R. 
    N. iv.). He answered several questions of a polemical tendency put by a Roman 
    commander, who can not be identified owing to the different ways in which 
    his name is written. These questions referred to the contradiction between 
    the figures in Num. iii. 22, 28, 34 and the total sum in verse 39 of the same 
    chapter (Bek. 5b), between Ex. xxxviii. 26 and 27 (ib.), and between Gen. 
    i. 20 and ii. 19 (?ul. 27b); also to the legal regulation in Ex. xxi. 29 (Yer. 
    Sanh. 19b), and to the law concerning the red heifer (Pesi?. 40a). In connection 
    with the last-mentioned question Johanan refers the Gentile to a Gentile analogy: 
    Just as the evil spirit is driven out of a person possessed through burning 
    certain roots and by other means, so the process of purification drives out 
    the &quot;unclean spirit&quot; (Zech. xiii. 2). To his pupils, however, who 
    were not satisfied with this answer, he said: &quot;By your lives, death does 
    not make impure, nor water clean; but it [the law concerning the red heifer] 
    is a decree of the All Holy, whose reasons we must not question&quot; (comp. 
    Lazarus, &quot;Die Ethik des Judenthums,&quot; i. 189, 246).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The omer.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A special group of 
    Johanan's haggadic text interpretations is given the name &quot;omer,&quot; 
    which term is related to the designation &quot;doreshe ?amurot,&quot; applied 
    to the ancient expositors of the Bible. In this group the interpretations 
    are symbolic, SEEKING TO PENETRATE INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE BIBLE TEXT.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One source (Tosef., 
    B. ? vii. 3 et seq.) puts five such explanations of Johanan together. They 
    answer the following questions: &quot;Why is the ear of a Hebrew slave bored 
    who voluntarily refuses to be made free?&quot; (Ex. xxi. 6; comp. ?id. 22b). 
    &quot;Why is iron excluded from the building material of the altar?&quot; 
    (Ex. xx. 25; Deut, xxvii. 5; comp. Mek., Yitro, Ba?odesh, 11). &quot;What 
    does the remarkable word 'asher' in Lev. iv. 22 mean?&quot; (comp. Hor. 10b). 
    &quot;WHY WAS ISRAEL EXILED SPECIALLY TO BABYLON?&quot; (comp. Pes. 87b). 
    &quot;Why were only the first tables of the testimony, and not the second, 
    considered to be the work of God?&quot; (Ex. xxxii. 16).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides the explanations 
    to these questions, Johanan gave others of a similar character. He explained 
    why a thief is punished more severely than a robber (B. ?. 79b), and by explaining 
    the Biblical numbers symbolically he answered the question: &quot;Why does 
    the Scripture (Ex. xxii. 1] ordain fivefold restitution for an ox and only 
    fourfold for a sheep?&quot; (ib.). The forty days of rain during the Flood 
    which destroyed sinful man (Gen. vii. 12) corresponded, he said, to the forty 
    days of the formation of the human embryo (Gen. R. xxxii.). The ten gerah 
    (= a half-shekel) of the atonement money (Ex. xxx. 13) corresponded to the 
    Ten Commandments, for the transgression for which atonement is to be made 
    (Pesi?. 19b).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among other things 
    Johanan explained the following:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exhortation to 
    those who are freed from military service to return home (Deut. xx. 5-7):&#151;this, 
    he said, was given in order that the cities of Israel might not become depopulated 
    in times of war (Sifre, Deut. 192). The passage Gen. ii. 19:&#151;he does 
    not find that the account of the creation of the animals is here repeated 
    but that their subjection to man is described (Gen. R. xvii). The words &quot;And 
    the eyes of them both were opened&quot; (Gen. iii. 7):&#151;this means that 
    God opened their eyes to the evil they had brought upon future generations 
    (Gen. R. xix.). Abraham's vision of the future (Gen. xv. 18):&#151;this showed 
    Abraham the present world only, not the future one (Gen. R. xliv.).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Johanan's views on 
    piety (comp. his motto given above) correspond to his teaching that Job's 
    piety was not based on the love of God, but on the fear of Him (Job. i. 1; 
    So?ah v. 5, reported by Joshua b. Hananiah). He explains the exhortation in 
    Eccl. ix. 8 allegorically: &quot;White garments and costly oils are not meant 
    here,&quot; he says (Eccl. R. ix. 6), &quot;for the Gentile peoples have these 
    in plenty: it is rather an exhortation to fulfil the Law, to do good deeds, 
    and to study the Scriptures.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Esoteric Doctrines.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a tradition concerning 
    the knowledge of esoteric doctrines (&quot;Ma'aseh Bereshit &quot; and &quot;Ma'aseh 
    Merkabah&quot;), related by Jose b. Judah, a tanna of the second half of the 
    second century, IT IS SAID THAT JOSHUA B. HANANIAH, THE PUPIL OF JOHANAN, 
    UNDER THE EYES OF HIS MASTER OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH ESOTERIC DOCTRINES AND 
    THAT AKIBA LEARNED THEM FROM HIM (?ag. 14b). According to another tradition 
    (ib.), it was Eleazar b. 'Arak with whom Johanan studied the mystic doctrines. 
    A remarkable saying of Johanan's has been preserved, which is in accord with 
    his study of mystic doctrines (?ag. 13a; comp. Pes. 94b). In this saying man 
    is advised to bring the infinity of God, the Creator of the world, nearer 
    to his own conception by imagining the space of the cosmos extended to unthinkable 
    distances.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion may 
    be mentioned the historical meaning which Johanan, on a certain sad occurrence, 
    gave to a verse of the Song of Solomon (Yitro, Ba?odesh, 1). In Ma'on, a town 
    of southern Judea, Johanan saw, probably not long after the destruction of 
    Jerusalem, a young Jewess picking out grains of barley from the ordure of 
    an Arab's horse, in order to still her hunger. Johanan said to his pupils 
    who were with him: &quot;My whole life long I have tried to understand that 
    sentence in the Song of Solomon [i. 8]: 'If thou know not, O thou fairest 
    among women,' etc. Now for the first time I catch its meaning: 'You did not 
    wish'&#151;so goes the word reproving Israel&#151;'to submit to God; hence 
    you are made subject to foreign peoples. You did not wish to pay God a half-shekel 
    for each person; now you pay 15 shekels to the government of your enemies. 
    You did not wish to repair the roads and streets for the holiday pilgrims; 
    you must now repair the road-houses and watch-towers for your oppressors. 
    And in you is fulfilled the prophecy [Deut. xviii. 47-48, R. V.]: Because 
    thou servedst not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, 
    by reason of the abundance of all things, therefore shalt thou serve thine 
    enemies, which the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger and in thirst, 
    and in nakedness, and in want of all things.'&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Johanan felt the fall 
    of his people more deeply than any one else, but&#151;and in this lies his 
    historical importance&#151;HE DID MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE TO PREPARE THE WAY 
    FOR ISRAEL TO RISE AGAIN.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Heavenly Throne; 
    hence &quot;Ma'aseh Merkabah,&quot; the lore concerning the heavenly Throne-Chariot, 
    with especial reference to Ezek. i. and x. The conception of Yhwh riding upon 
    cherubim, or fiery cloud-birds, upon the heavens or the clouds, is certainly 
    genuinely Hebrew (see Ps. xviii. 11 [A. V. 10]; Deut. xxxiii. 26; Ps. lxviii. 
    5 [A. V. 4]; Isa. xix. 1); hence His &quot;war-chariot&quot; (Hab. iii. 8 
    and Isa. lxvi. 15, Hebr.) and the name &quot;chariot&quot; for the ark with 
    the cherubim (I Chron. xxviii. 18). Just as the Assyrian sunchariot with its 
    horses is employed in the legend of the ride of Elijah to heaven (II Kings 
    ii. 11; comp. Enoch lxx. 2, lxxii. 5, lxxiii. 2), so did the prophet Ezekiel 
    in his vision, probably suggested by Babylonian sculpture, see Yhwh riding 
    on the Throne-Chariotwhen leaving the doomed Temple at Jerusalem (see M&uuml;ller, 
    &quot;Ezechielstudien,&quot; 1895, pp. 8-11; Bertholet, &quot;Das Buch Hezekiel,&quot; 
    1897, p. 12). To a later age Ezekiel's picture became a sacred mystery known 
    by the term &quot;Merkabah&quot; as early as the time of Ben Sira (Ecclus. 
    xlix. 8). The ancient Mishnah lays down the rule: &quot;The Ma'aseh Merkabah 
    should not be taught to any one except he be wise and able to deduce knowledge 
    through wisdom ('gnosis') of his own&quot; (?ag. ii. 1). Job beheld the throne 
    of God, and his daughters sang the doxology of the Ma'aseh Merkabah (according 
    to the Testament of Job, ed. Kohler, vii. 39, xi. 25; see Kohut Memorial Volume, 
    pp. 282, 288). Quite characteristic is the story given in Tosef., ?ag. ii. 
    1; ?ag. 14b; Yer. ?ag. ii. 77a:(p?e?&micro;at????; see Jo&euml;l, &quot;Blicke 
    in die Religionsgeschichte,&quot; 1880, pp. 133-135). </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;R. Eleazar ben 
    'Arak was riding on a mule behind R. Johanan b. Zakkai, when he asked for 
    the privilege of being initiated into the secrets of the Merkabah. The great 
    master demanded proof of his initiation into the gnosis, and when Eleazar 
    began to tell what he had learned thereof, R. Johanan immediately descended 
    from the mule and sat upon the rock. 'Why, O master, dost thou descend from 
    the mule?' asked the disciple. 'Can I remain mounted upon the mule when the 
    telling of the secrets of the Merkabah causes the Shekinah to dwell with us 
    and the angels to accompany us?' was the answer. Eleazar continued, and, behold, 
    fire descended from heaven and lit up the trees of the field, causing them 
    to sing anthems, and an angel cried out, 'TRULY THESE ARE SECRETS OF THE MERKABAH' 
    Whereupon R. Johanan kissed Eleazar upon the forehead, saying, 'Blessed be 
    thou, O father Abraham, that hast a descendant like Eleazar b. 'Arak!' Subsequently 
    two other disciples of R. Johanan b. Zakkai walking together said to each 
    other: 'Let us also talk together about the Ma'aseh Merkabah'; and no sooner 
    did R. Joshua begin speaking THAN A RAINBOW-LIKE APPEARANCE [Ezek. i. 28] 
    WAS SEEN UPON THE THICK CLOUDS WHICH COVERED THE SKY, and angels came to listen 
    as men do to hear wedding-music. On hearing the things related by R. Jose, 
    R. Johanan b. Zakkai blessed his disciples and said: 'Blessed the eyes that 
    beheld these things! Indeed I saw myself in a dream together with you, seated 
    like the select ones [comp. Ex. xxiv. 11] upon Mount Sinai; and I heard a 
    heavenly voice saying: &quot;Enter the banquet-hall and take your seats with

    SIMEON BEN YOCHAI<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By : Kaufmann Kohler M. Seligsohn 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    Pupil of Akiba. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tanna of the second 
    century; supposed author of the Zohar; born in Galilee; died, according to 
    tradition, at Meron, on the 18th of Iyyar (Lag be-'Omer). In the Baraita, 
    Midrash, and Gemara his name occurs either as Simeon or as Simeon ben Yohai, 
    but in the Mishnah, with the exception of ?ag. i. 7, he is always quoted as 
    R. Simeon. He was one of the principal pupils of Akiba, under whom he studied 
    thirteen years at Bene-Bera? (Lev. R. xxi. 7 et al.). It would seem, from 
    Ber. 28a, that Simeon had previously studied at Jabneh, under Gamaliel II. 
    and Joshua b. Hananiah, and that he was the cause of the quarrel that broke 
    out between these two chiefs. But considering that about forty-five years 
    later, when Akiba was thrown into prison, Simeon's father was still alive 
    (see below), and that Simeon insisted upon Akiba's teaching him even in prison, 
    Frankel (&quot;Darke ha-Mishnah,&quot; p. 168) thinks Ber. 28a is spurious. 
    Simeon's acuteness was tested and recognized by Akiba when he first came to 
    him; of all his pupils Akiba ordained only Me&iuml;r and Simeon. Conscious 
    of his own merit, Simeon felt hurt at being ranked after Me&iuml;r, and Akiba 
    was compelled to soothe him with soft words (Yer. Ter. 46b; Yer. Sanh. i. 
    19a). During Akiba's lifetime Simeon was found occasionally at Sidon, where 
    he seems to have shown great independence in his halakic decisions.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following incident 
    of Simeon's stay at Sidon, illustrating both his wit and his piety, may be 
    mentioned: A man and his wife, who, though they had been married ten years, 
    had no children, appeared before Simeon at Sidon to secure a divorce. Observing 
    that they loved each other, and not being able to refuse a request which was 
    in agreement with rabbinical law, Simeon told them that as their wedding was 
    marked by a feast they should mark their separation in the same way. The result 
    was that both changed their minds, and, owing to Simeon's prayer, God granted 
    them a child (Pesi?. xxii. 147a; Cant. R. i. 4). Simeon often returned to 
    Akiba, and once he conveyed a message to him from his fellow pupil ?anina 
    ben ?akinai (Niddah 52b; Tosef., Niddah, vi. 6).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simeon's love for 
    his great teacher was profound. When Akiba was thrown into prison by Hadrian, 
    Simeon, probably through the influence of his father, who was in favor at 
    the court of Rome, found a way to enter the prison. He still insisted upon 
    Akiba's teaching him, and when the latter refused, Simeon jestingly threatened 
    to tell his father, Yo?ai, who would cause Akiba to be punished more severely(Pes. 
    112a). After Akiba's death Simeon was again ordained, with four other pupils 
    of Akiba's, by Judah b. Baba (Sanh. 14a).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anti-Roman Feeling.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The persecution of 
    the Jews under Hadrian inspired Simeon with a different opinion of the Romans 
    than that held by his father. On more than one occasion Simeon manifested 
    his anti-Roman feeling. When, at a meeting between Simeon and his former fellow 
    pupils at Usha, probably about a year and a half after Akiba's death (c. 126), 
    Judah ben Ila'i spoke in praise of the Roman government, Simeon replied that 
    the institutions which seemed so praiseworthy to Judah were for the benefit 
    of the Romans only, to facilitate the carrying out of their wicked designs. 
    Simeon's words were carried by Judah b. Gerim, one of his own pupils, to the 
    Roman governor, who sentenced Simeon to death (according to Gr&auml;tz, this 
    governor was Varus, who ruled under Antoninus Pius, and the event took place 
    about 161). Simeon was compelled to seek refuge in a cavern, where he remained 
    thirteen years, till the emperor, possibly Hadrian, died (Yer. Sheb. ix. 38d; 
    Shab. 33b; Pesi?. 88b; Gen. R. lxxix. 6; Eccl. R. x. 8; Esth. R. i. 9). Two 
    different accounts of Simeon's stay in the cavern and of his movements after 
    leaving it are given in Shabbat (l.c.) and in the five other sources just 
    mentioned. The latter, of which Yer. Sheb. ix. 38d seems to be the most authentic, 
    relate, with some variations, that Simeon, accompanied by his son Eleazar 
    (in Yer. Sheb. Simeon alone), hid himself in a cavern near Gadara, where they 
    stayed thirteen years, living on dates and the fruit of the carob-tree, their 
    whole bodies thus becoming covered with eruptions. One day, seeing that a 
    bird had repeatedly escaped the net set for it by a hunter, Simeon and his 
    son were encouraged to leave the cavern, taking the escape of the bird as 
    an omen that God would not forsake them. When outside the cavern, they heard 
    a &quot;bat kol&quot; say, &quot;Ye are [singular in Yer. Sheb.] free&quot;; 
    they accordingly went their way. Simeon then bathed in the warm springs of 
    Tiberias, which rid him of the disease contracted in the cavern, and he showed 
    his gratitude to the town in the following manner:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His Miracles.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tiberias had been 
    built by Herod Antipas on a site where there were many tombs (Josephus, &quot;Ant.&quot; 
    xviii. 2, &sect; 3), the exact locations of which had been lost. The town 
    therefore had been regarded as unclean. Resolving to remove the cause of the 
    uncleanness, Simeon planted lupines in all suspected places; wherever they 
    did not take root he knew that a tomb was underneath. The bodies were then 
    exhumed and removed, and the town pronounced clean. To annoy and discredit 
    Simeon, a certain Samaritan secretly replaced one of the bodies. But Simeon 
    learned through the power of the Holy Spirit what the Samaritan had done, 
    and said, &quot;Let what is above go down, and what is below come up.&quot; 
    The Samaritan was entombed; and a schoolmaster of Magdala (but comp. Buber, 
    note 180, to Pesi?. x. 90a), who mocked Simeon for his declaration, was turned 
    into a heap of bones.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the version, 
    in Shab. l.c., Simeon and Eleazar hid in a cavern, whereupon a carob-tree 
    and a spring miraculously appeared there. In order to spare their garments 
    they sat naked in the sand, in consequence of which their skin became covered 
    with scabs. At the end of twelve years the prophet Elijah announced to them 
    the death of the emperor, and the consequent annulment of the sentence of 
    death against them. When they came forth Simeon observed people occupied with 
    agricultural pursuits to the neglect of the Torah, and, being angered thereby, 
    smote them by his glances. A bat kol then ordered him to return to the cavern, 
    where he and Eleazar remained twelve months longer, at the end of which time 
    they were ordered by a bat ?ol to come forth. When they did so, Simeon was 
    met by his son-in-law Phinehas b. Jair (comp., however, Zacuto, &quot;Yu?asin,&quot; 
    ed. Filipowski, p. 46), who wept at seeing him in such a miserable state. 
    But Simeon told him that he ought to rejoice, for during the thirteen years' 
    stay in the cavern his knowledge of the Torah had been much increased. Simeon 
    then, in gratitude for the miracle that had been wrought for him, undertook 
    the purification of Tiberias. He threw some lupines into the ground, whereupon 
    the bodies came to the surface at various places, which were then marked as 
    tombs. Not only was the man who mocked at Simeon's announcement of the purification 
    of Tiberias turned into a heap of bones, but also Simeon's pupil and delator, 
    Judah b. Gerim.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">School at Tekoa.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It appears that Simeon 
    settled afterward at Meron, the valley in front of which place was filled, 
    at Simeon's command, with gold dinars (Tan., Pe?ude, 7; Ex. R. lii. 3; comp. 
    Yer. Ber. ix. 13d; Pesi?. x. 87b; Gen. R. xxxv. 2). On the other hand, it 
    is said that Simeon established a flourishing school at Tekoa, among the pupils 
    of which was Judah I. (Tosef., 'Er. viii. [v.] 6; Shab. 147b). It has been 
    shown by Gr&auml;tz that this Tekoa evidently was in Galilee, and hence must 
    not be identified with the Biblical Tekoa, which was in the territory of Judah 
    (II Chron. xi. 6). Bacher (&quot;Ag. Tan.&quot; ii. 76) endeavors to show 
    that Tekoa and Meron were one and the same place.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the last important 
    event in Simeon's life it is recorded that, accompanied by Eleazar b. Jose, 
    he was sent to Rome with a petition to the emperor for the abolition of the 
    decree against the three main observances of the Jewish religion, and that 
    his mission was successful (Me'i. 17b). The reason Simeon was chosen for this 
    mission is stated (ib.) to have been that he was known as a man in whose favor 
    miracles often were wrought. At Rome, too, Simeon's success was due to a miracle, 
    for while on the way he was met by the demon Ben Temalion, who offered his 
    assistance. According to agreement, the demon entered into the emperor's daughter, 
    and Simeon exorcised it when he arrived at the Roman court. The emperor then 
    took Simeon into his treasure-house, leaving him to choose his own reward. 
    Simeon found there the vexatious decree, which he took away and tore into 
    pieces (comp. &quot;Tefillot R. Shim'on b. Yo?ai&quot; in Jellinek, &quot;B. 
    H.&quot; iv. 117 et seq., where, instead of &quot;Ben Temalion,&quot; &quot;Asmodeus&quot; 
    occurs). This legend, the origin of which apparently is non-Jewish, has been 
    the subject of discussion bymodern scholars. Israel L&eacute;vi (in &quot;R. 
    E. J.&quot; viii. 200 et seq.) thinks it is a variation of the legend, found 
    in the &quot;Acta Apostolorum Apocrypha&quot; (ed. Tischendorf, pp. 246 et 
    seq.), of the apostle Bartholomew exorcising a demon that had taken possession 
    of the daughter of Polymnius, the King of India. Israel L&eacute;vi's opinion 
    was approved by Joseph Hal&eacute;vy (in &quot;R. E. J.&quot; x. 60 et seq.). 
    Bacher (ib. xxxv. 285 et seq.) thinks there is another Christian legend which 
    corresponds more closely to the Talmudic narrative, namely, that narrated 
    by Simeon Metaphrastes in &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; (vol. ix., Oct. 22, 1896), 
    according to which Abercius exorcised a demon from Lucilla, the daughter of 
    Marcus Aurelius.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simeon is stated to 
    have said that whatever might be the number of persons deserving to enter 
    heaven he and his son were certainly of that number, so that if there were 
    only two, these were himself and his son (Suk. 45b; Sanh. 97b; comp. Shab. 
    33b). He is also credited with saying that, united with his son and Jotham, 
    King of Judah, he would be able to free the world from judgment (Suk. l.c.; 
    comp. Yer. Ber. ix. 13d and Gen. R. xxxv. 3 [where Simeon mentions Abraham 
    and the prophet Ahijah of Shiloh, instead of his son and Jotham]). Thus, on 
    account of his exceptional piety and continual study of the Law, Simeon was 
    considered as one of those whose merit preserves the world, and therefore 
    during his life the rainbow was never seen, that promise of God's forbearance 
    not being needed (Yer. Ber. l.c.).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His Halakot.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simeon's halakot are 
    very numerous; they are met with in all the treatises of the Talmud except 
    Berakot, ?allah, Ta'anit, Nedarim, Tamid, and Middot. He greatly valued the 
    teaching of his master Akiba, and he is reported to have recommended his pupils 
    to follow his own system of interpretation (&quot;middot&quot;) because it 
    was derived from that of Akiba (Gi?. 67a). But this itself shows that Simeon 
    did not follow his teacher in every point; indeed, as is shown below, he often 
    differed from Akiba, declaring his own interpretations to be the better (Sifre, 
    Deut. 31; R. H. 18b). He was independent in his halakic decisions, and did 
    not refrain from criticizing the tannaim of the preceding generations (comp. 
    Tosef., Oh. iii. 8, xv. 11). He and Jose b. ?alafta were generally of the 
    same opinion; but sometimes Simeon sided with Me&iuml;r (Kelim iii. 5; Me'i. 
    11a). Like the other pupils of Akiba, who, wishing to perpetuate the latter's 
    teaching, systematized it in the foundation of the Mishnah (R. Me&iuml;r), 
    Tosefta (R. Nehemiah), and Sifra (R. Judah), Simeon is credited with the authorship 
    of the Sifre (Sanh. 86a) and of the Mekilta de-Rabbi Shim'on, the former work 
    being a halakic midrash to Numbers and Deuteronomy, the latter a similar midrash 
    to Exodus.<br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The particular characteristic 
    of Simeon's teaching was that whether in a halakah or in a haggadic interpretation 
    of a Biblical command, he endeavored to find the underlying reason therefor 
    (B. M. 115a et al.). This often resulted in a material modification of the 
    command in question. From many instances the following may be taken: In the 
    prohibition against taking a widow's raiment in pledge (Deut.xxiv. 17) it 
    was Judah b. Ila'i's opinion that no difference is to be made between a rich 
    and a poor widow. But Simeon gives the reason for such a prohibition, which 
    was that if such a pledge were taken it would be necessary to return it every 
    evening (comp. Ex. xxii. 25-26), and going to the widow's home every morning 
    and evening might compromise her reputation; consequently, he declares, the 
    prohibition applies only in the case of a poor widow, since one who is rich 
    would not need to have the garment returned in the evening (B. M. l.c.).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simeon's name was 
    widely identified with this halakic principle of interpretation, and his teacher 
    Akiba approved of it; therefore his contemporaries often applied to him when 
    they wished to know the reason for certain halakot (Tosef., Zeb. i. 8). Simeon 
    also divided the oral law into numbered groups, of which fifteen are preserved 
    in the Talmud. He especially favored the system of giving general rules, of 
    which there are a great number (Bik. iii. 10; Zeb. 119b et al.). All this 
    shows that he was systematic, and that he had the power of expressing himself 
    clearly (Sheb. ii. 3; 'Er. 104b). He was dogmatic in his halakic decisions, 
    but where there was a doubt as to which of two courses should be followed, 
    and the Rabbis adopted a compromise, he admitted the legality of either course 
    (Yeb. iii. 9). He differed from Akiba in that he did not think that particles 
    like &quot;et,&quot; &quot;gam,&quot; and others contain in themselves indications 
    of halakot (Men. 11b); but in many instances he showed that he was opposed 
    to R. Ishmael's opinion that the Torah speaks as men do and that seemingly 
    pleonastic words can never serve as the basis for deducing new laws (Sifre, 
    Re'eh, 119; R. H. 8b; Zeb. 108b et al.).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simeon is very prominent 
    also in the Haggadah, and his utterances are numerous in both Talmuds. Many 
    of his sayings bear on the study of the Torah, which, according to him, should 
    be the main object of man's life. Notwithstanding the stress he laid on the 
    importance of prayer, and particularly on the reading of the &quot;Shema',&quot; 
    he declared that one must not, for the sake of either, interrupt the study 
    of the Torah (Yer. ?ag. ii. 77a). &quot;There are three crowns,&quot; he says, 
    &quot;the first being that of the Torah&quot; (Ab. iv. 13); he completes his 
    sentence with the words, &quot;But the crown of a good name mounts above them 
    all,&quot; showing that, in addition to studying the Law, one must execute 
    the commands by which he can acquire a good name. The Torah, also, is one 
    of the three good gifts which God gave to Israel and which can not be preserved 
    without suffering (Mek., Yitro, Ba?odesh, 10; Sifre, Deut. 32; Ber. 5a). But 
    recognizing the difficulty of occupying oneself with the study of the Torah 
    and of providing a livelihood at the same time, Simeon said that the Torah 
    was given only for those who ate the manna or the priestly meals (Mek., Beshalla?, 
    Waye?i, 1, Wayassa', 2). He declared also that had he been on Mount Sinai 
    when God delivered the Torah to Israel, he would have requested two mouths 
    for man, one to be used exclusively as a means for repeating and thus learning 
    the Torah. But then he added, &quot;How great also would be the evil done 
    by delators [&quot;moserim&quot;) with two mouths!&quot; (Yer. Shab. i. 3a, 
    b; Yer. Ber. i. 3b).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His Ethical Views.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among Simeon's many 
    other utterances may be mentioned those with regard to repentance, and some 
    of his ethical sayings. &quot;So great is the power of repentance that a man 
    who has been during his lifetime very wicked [&quot;rasha' gamur&quot;], if 
    he repent toward the end, is considered a perfectly righteous man&quot; (Tosef., 
    ?id. i. 14; ?id. 40b; Cant. R. v. 16). He was particularly severe against 
    haughtiness, which, he declared, is like idolatry (So?ah 4b), and against 
    publicly shaming one's neighbor: &quot;One should rather throw himself into 
    a burning furnace than shame a neighbor in public&quot; (Ber. 43b). He denounced 
    the crimes of usury, deceitful dealing, and disturbing domestic peace (Yer. 
    B. M. 10d; B. M. 58b; Lev. R. ix.). HIS ANIMOSITY TOWARD THE GENTILES GENERALLY 
    AND TOWARD FEMININE SUPERSTITION IS EXPRESSED IN THE FOLLOWING UTTERANCE: 
    &quot;THE BEST OF THE HEATHEN MERITS DEATH; THE BEST OF THE SERPENTS SHOULD 
    HAVE ITS HEAD CRUSHED; AND THE MOST PIOUS OF WOMEN IS PRONE TO SORCERY&quot; 
    (Yer. ?id. iv. 66c; Massek. Soferim xv. 10; comp. Mek., Beshalla?, Waye?i, 
    1, and Tan., Wayera, 20). His hostility to the Romans, mentioned above, is 
    expressed also in his maxims; thus, alluding probably to the Parthian war 
    which broke out in the time of Antoninus Pius, he said: &quot;If thou hast 
    seen a Persian [Parthian] horse tied in Palestine, then hope for the arrival 
    of the Messiah&quot; (Cant. R. viii. 10; Lam. R. i. 13).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R. Simeon combined 
    with his rationalism in halakah a strange mysticism in his haggadic teachings, 
    as well as in his practise. HE SPOKE OF A MAGIC SWORD, ON WHICH THE NAME WAS 
    INSCRIBED, BEING GIVEN BY GOD TO MOSES ON SINAI (Midr. Teh. to Ps. xc. 2; 
    comp. ib. to Ps. xxxvi. 8; Gen. R. xxxv.); and he ascribed all kinds of miraculous 
    powers to Moses (Me'i. 17b; Sanh. 97b). After his death he appeared to the 
    saints in their visions (B. M. 84b; Ket. 77b; Sanh. 98a). THUS HIS NAME BECAME 
    CONNECTED WITH MYSTIC LORE, AND HE BECAME A CHIEF AUTHORITY FOR THE CABALISTS; 
    for this reason THE ZOHAR FIRST APPEARED UNDER THE NAME OF MIDRASH DE-RABBI 
    SHIM'ON BEN YOCHAI (see Zohar). There exist, besides, two apocryphal midrashim 
    ascribed to this tanna (published by Jellinek, &quot;B. H.&quot; iii. 78 et 
    seq., iv. 117 et seq.). The first is entitled &quot;Nistarot de-R. Shim'on 
    b. Yo?ai&quot;; the second, &quot;Tefillat R. Shim'on b. Yo?ai&quot;; both 
    of them bear on the Messianic time, but the second is more complete. The main 
    point of these midrashim is that while Simeon was hidden in the cavern, he 
    fasted forty days and prayed to God to rescue Israel from such persecutions. 
    THEN METATRON REVEALED TO HIM THE FUTURE, announcing the various Mohammedan 
    rulers, the last one of whom would perish at the hands of the Messiah. As 
    in similar Messianic apocrypha, the chief characters are Armilus and the three 
    Messiahs&#151;Messiah b. Joseph, Messiah b. Ephraim, and Messiah b. David.</font></p>

      is urgent; the Herald crieth aloud daily, and the reapers of the land are 
      few; and those who are about the end of the vineyard attend not, AND HAVE 
      NOT KNOWN WHERE MAY BE THE LAWFUL PLACE.'&quot; .</font></p>
    <p></p>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Rabbi Schimeon spake unto 
    his companions, and said, 'HOW LONG SHALL WE ABIDE IN THE CONDITION OF ONE 
    COLUMN BY ITSELF'? When it is written, Psalm 119:126: &quot;It is time for 
    Thee, Lord, to lay Thine Hand, for they have destroyed Thy law.&quot;' </font>
    <p></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rabbi Schimeon (Simon) sat down 
      and wept; then he said, 'WOE! IF I SHOULD REVEAL IT! WOE IF I SHOULD REVEAL 
      IT NOT!' His companions who were with him were silent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rabbi Abba arose and said unto 
      him: 'With the favour of the Lord, also it is written, (Ps.24:14), &quot;The 
      Arcanum of Tetragrammaton (YHVH) is with them that fear him.&quot; And well 
      do these companions fear the Holy and Blessed One; and now they have entered 
      into the assembly of the tabernacle of his house, some of them have only 
      entered, and some of them have departed also.' Moreover it is said the companions 
      who were with Rabbi Schimeon were numbered and they were found to consist 
      of Rabbi Eleazar, his son; and Rabbi Abba, and Rabbi Yahuda, and Rabbi Yosi 
      the son of Jacob, and Rabbi Isaac, and Rabbi Chisqiah the son of Rav, and 
      Rabbi Chia, and Rabbi Yosi, and Rabbi Yisa. (Ten in all).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They gave their hands unto Rabbi 
      Schimeon, and raised their fingers on high, and entered into a field under 
      the trees (as Druids do) and sat down...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rabbi Schimeon began, and said, 
      'Time for Thee, O Tetragrammaton, to lay Thine Hand.' (see Chapter 6). Why 
      is it time for the Tetragrammaton to lay His hand? Because they have perverted 
      Thy law. What is this, 'they have perverted Thy law?' The Higher law, which 
      is itself made void, if it is not carried out according to His commands. 
      Wherefore is this? (Or, as others read: Wherefore is this name Tetragrammaton 
      here employed?) This hath been said concerning the Ancient of Days. For 
      it is written, Deut.33:29: 'Blessed art thou O Israel: who is like unto 
      thee?' Also it is written, Exodus 15:11: Who is like unto Thee among the 
      gods, O Tetragrammaton?'</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul is not a proper name. It

  Elisha an &quot;Epicurean&quot; </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Born in Jerusalem before 70; flourished 
  in Palestine at the end of the first century and the beginning of the second. 
  At one time the Rabbis were proud to recognize him as of their number; but later 
  their opposition to him grew so intense that they even refrained from pronouncing 
  his name, and referred to him in terms used to designate some vile object (&quot;dabar 
  a?er,&quot; lit. &quot;another thing&quot;). For this reason it is almost impossible 
  to derive from rabbinical sources a clear picture of his personality, and modern 
  historians have differed greatly in their estimate of him. According to Gr&auml;tz, 
  he was a Karpotian Gnostic; according to Siegfried, a follower of Philo; according 
  to Dubsch, a Christian; according to Smolenskin and Weiss, a victim of the inquisitor 
  Akiba.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Youth and Activity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of Elisha's youth and of his activity 
  as a teacher of the Law very little is known. He was the son of an esteemed 
  and rich citizen of Jerusalem, and was trained for the career of a scholar. 
  His praise of this method of education is the only saying that the Mishnah has 
  found worth perpetuating. According to Abot iv. 25, his favorite saying was, 
  &quot;Learning in youth is like writing upon new paper, but learning in old 
  age is like writing upon paper which has already been used.&quot; Elisha was 
  a student of Greek; as the Talmud expresses it, &quot;Aher's tongue was never 
  tired of singing Greek songs&quot; (Yer. Meg. i. 9), which, according to some, 
  caused his apostasy (?ag. 16b, below). Bacher has very properly remarked that 
  the similes which Elisha is reported to have used (Ab. R. N. xxiv.) show that 
  he was a man of the world, acquainted with wine, horses, and architecture. He 
  must have acquired a reputation as an authority in questions of religious practise, 
  since one of his halakic decisions is recorded&#151;the only one in his name, 
  though there may be others under the names of different teachers. The Babylonian 
  Talmud asserts that Elisha, while a teacher in the bet ha-midrash, kept forbidden 
  books (&quot;sifre minim&quot;) hidden in his clothes. This statement is not 
  found in the Jerusalem Talmud, and if at all historical, may possibly mean that 
  he also studied the writings of the Sadducees, who, owing to changes made by 
  the censors, are sometimes called &quot;minim.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The oldest and most striking reference 
  to the views of Elisha is found in the following baraita (?ag. 14b; Yer. ii. 
  1):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Four [sages] entered paradise&#151;Ben 
  'Azzai, Ben Zoma, A?er, and Akiba. Ben 'Azzai looked and died; Ben Zoma went 
  mad; A?er destroyed the plants; Akiba alone came out unhurt.&quot;</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will 
    come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether 
    in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body I cannot tell: God 
    knoweth); such a one caught up to the Third heaven.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And I knew such a man...HOW HE WAS CAUGHT UP INTO PARADISE, 
    AND HEARD UNSPEAKABLE WORDS, WHICH IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR A MAN TO UTTER...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Corinthians 12:1-8).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Four Who Entered Paradise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There can be no doubt that the journey 
  of the &quot;four&quot; to paradise, like the ascension of Enoch (in the pre-Christian 
  books of Enoch) and of so many other pious men, is to be taken literally and 
  not allegorically. This conception of the baraita is supported by the use of 
  the phrase (&quot;entered paradise&quot;), since (&quot;entered the Garden of 
  Eden&quot; = paradise) was a common expression (Derek Ere? Zu?a i.; Ab. R. N. 
  xxv.). It means that Elisha, like Paul, in a moment of ecstasy beheld the interior 
  of heaven&#151;in the former's case, however, with the effect that he destroyed 
  the plants of the heavenly garden.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Talmud gives two different interpretations 
  of this last phrase. The Babylonian Talmud says:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What is the meaning of 'A?er 
  destroyed the plants'? Scripture refers to him (Eccl. v. 5 [A. V. 6]) when it 
  says: 'Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin.' What does this signify? 
  In heaven Aher saw Metatron seated while he wrote down the merits of Israel. 
  Whereupon Aher said: 'We have been taught to believe that no one sits in heaven, 
  . . . or are there perhaps two supreme powers?' Then a heavenly voice was heard: 
  'Turn, O backsliding children (Jer. iii. 14), with the exception of Aher.'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Talmudic Explanation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dualism with which the Talmud 
  charges him has led some scholars to see here Persian, Gnostic, or even Philonian 
  dualism. They forget that the reference here to Metatron&#151;a specifically 
  Babylonian idea, which would probably be unknown to Palestinian rabbis even 
  five hundred years after Elisha&#151;robs the passage of all historical worth. 
  The story is of late origin, as is seen from the introductory words, which stand 
  in no connection with the context, as they do in the parallel passage in the 
  Jerusalem Talmud. This latter makes no mention of Elisha's dualism; but it relates 
  that in the critical period following the rebellion of Bar Kokba, Elisha visited 
  the schools and attempted to entice the students from the study of the Torah, 
  in order to direct their energies to some more practical occupation; and it 
  is to him, therefore, that the verse &quot;Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy 
  flesh to sin &quot;(Eccl. v. 5) is to be applied. In connection with this the 
  Biblical quotation is quiteintelligible, as according to another haggadah (Shab. 
  34b; Eccl. R. v. 5) &quot;flesh&quot; here means children&#151;spiritual children, 
  pupils&#151;whom Elisha killed with his mouth by luring them from the study 
  of the Torah....</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not 
    hear the law?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one 
    by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; 
    but he of the freewoman was by promise.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Which things are an allegory: for these are two covenants; 
    the one from mount Sinai </font></i>(not the Higher Sinai, but the several 
    places believed to be Sinai in the East)<i><font size="+1">, which gendereth 
    to bondage, which is Hagar.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth

  <p><i><font size="+1">But JERUSALEM WHICH IS ABOVE IS FREE, WHICH IS THE MOTHER 
    OF US ALL...</font></i><font size="+1">(Galatians 4:21-26).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Babylonia amoraim must have 
  known this story, from which they took the concluding part and attached it to 
  another legend. The Jerusalem Talmud is also the authority for the statement 
  that Elisha played the part of an informer during the Hadrianic persecutions, 
  when the Jews were ordered to violate the laws of the Torah. As evidence of 
  this it is related that when the Jews were ordered to do work on the Sabbath, 
  they tried to perform it in a way which could be considered as not profaning 
  the Sabbath. But Elisha betrayed the Pharisees to the Roman authorities. Thus 
  it is probable that the antipathy of Elisha was not directed against Judaism 
  in general, but only against Pharisaism. The reason given for his apostasy is 
  also characteristic. He saw how one man had lost his life while fulfilling a 
  law for the observance of which the Torah promised a long life (Deut. xxii. 
  7), whereas another man who broke the same law was not hurt in the least. This 
  practical demonstration, as well as the frightful sufferings of the martyrs 
  during the Hadrianic persecutions, strengthened his conviction that there was 
  no reward for virtue in this life or the next. These statements of the Jerusalem 
  Talmud are no doubt based on reliable tradition, as they are also confirmed 
  by the Babylonian Talmud (?id. 39b). Bearing in mind what is said about Elisha, 
  there can be little doubt that he was a Sadducee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Elisha an &quot;Epicurean&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The harsh treatment he received from 
  the Pharisees WAS DUE TO HIS HAVING DESERTED THEIR RANKS AT SUCH A CRITICAL 
  TIME. Quite in harmony with this supposition are the other sins laid to his 
  charge; namely, that he rode in an ostentatious manner through the streets of 
  Jerusalem on a Day of Atonement which fell upon a Sabbath, and that he was bold 
  enough to overstep the &quot;te?um&quot; (the limits of the Sabbath-day journey). 
  Both the Jerusalem and the Babylonian Talmuds agree here, and cite this as proof 
  that Elisha turned from Pharisaism to heresy. It was just such non-observance 
  of customs that excited the anger of Akiba (So?ah 27b). The mention of the &quot;Holy 
  of Holies&quot; in this passage is not an anachronism, as Gr&auml;tz thinks. 
  For while it is true that Eliezer and Joshua were present as the geonim par 
  excellence at Elisha's circumcision&#151;which must, therefore, have occurred 
  after the death of Johanan ben Zakkai (80 C.E.)&#151;it is also true that the 
  &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; is likewise mentioned in connection with Rabbi Akiba 
  (Mak., end); indeed, the use of this expression is due to the fact that the 
  Rabbis held holiness to be inherent in the place, not in the building (Yeb. 
  6b).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same passage from the Jerusalem 
  Talmud refers to Elisha as being alive when his pupil R. Me&iuml;r had become 
  a renowned teacher. According to the assumption made above, he must have reached 
  his seventieth year at that time. If Elisha were a Sadducee, the friendship 
  constantly shown him by R. Me&iuml;r could be understood. This friendship would 
  have been impossible had Elisha been an apostate or a man of loose morals, as 
  has been asserted. Sadducees and Pharisees, however, lived in friendly intercourse 
  with one another (for example, Rabban Gamaliel with Sadducees; 'Er. 77b). For 
  legends concerning Elisha see Johanan ben Nappa?a; Me&iuml;r; compare also Gnosticism.</font></p>

  ELIEZER (LIEZER) BEN HYRCANUS<br>

<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the most prominent tannaim 
  of the first and second centuries; disciple of R. Johanan ben Zakkai (Ab. ii. 
  8; Ab. R. N. vi. 3, xiv. 5) and colleague of Gamaliel II., whose sister he married 
  (see Imma Shalom), and of Joshua b. Hananiah (Ab. l.c.; Ab. R. N. l.c.; B. B. 
  10b). His earlier years are wrapped in myths; but from these latter it may be 
  inferred that he was somewhat advanced in life when a desire for learning first 
  seized him, and impelled him, contrary to the wishes of his father, to desert 
  his regular occupation and to repair to Jerusalem to devote himself to the study 
  of the Torah. Here he entered Johanan's academy and for years studied diligently, 
  notwithstanding the fact that he had to cope with great privations. It is said 
  that sometimes many days elapsed during which he did not have a single meal. 
  Johanan, recognizing Eliezer's receptive and retentive mind, styled him &quot;a 
  cemented cistern that loses not a drop&quot; (Ab. l.c.). These endowments were 
  so pronounced in him that in later years he could declare, &quot;I have never 
  taught anything which I had not learned from my masters&quot; (Suk. 28a).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His father in the meantime determined 
  to disinherit him, and with that purpose in view went to Jerusalem, there to 
  declare his will before Johanan ben Zakkai. The great teacher, having heard 
  of Hyrcanus' arrival and of the object of his visit, instructed the usher to 
  reserve for the expected visitor a seat among those to be occupied by the &eacute;lite 
  of the city, and appointed Eliezer lecturer for that day. At first the latter 
  hesitated to venture on Johanan's place, but, pressed by the master and encouraged 
  by his friends, delivered a discourse, gradually displaying wonderful knowledge. 
  Hyrcanus having recognized in the lecturer his truant son, and hearing the encomiums 
  which Johanan showered on him, now desired to transfer all his earthly possessions 
  to Eliezer; but the scholar, overjoyed at the reconciliation, declined to take 
  advantage of his brothers, and requested to be allowed to have only his proportionate 
  share (Ab. R. N. vi. 3; Pir?e R. El. i. et seq.). He continued his attendance 
  at Johanan's college until near the close of the siege of Jerusalem, when he 
  and Joshua assisted in smuggling their master out of the city and into the Roman 
  camp.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Subsequently Eliezer proceeded to 
  Jabneh (Ab.R. N. iv. 5; Gi?. 56), where he later became a member of the Sanhedrin 
  under the presidency of Gamaliel II. (Ab. R. N. xiv. 6; Sanh. 17b), though he 
  had established, and for many years afterward conducted, his own academy at 
  Lydda (Sanh. 36b). His fame as a great scholar had in the meantime spread, R. 
  Johanan himself declaring that Eliezer was unequaled as an expositor of traditional 
  law (Ab. R. N. vi. 3); and many promising students, among them Akiba (ib.; Yer. 
  Pes. vi. 33b), attached themselves to his school.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eliezer became known as &quot;Eliezer 
  ha-Gadol&quot; (&quot;the Great&quot;; Tosef., 'Orlah, 8; Ber. 6a, 32a; So?ah 
  13b, 48b, 49a; generally, however, he is styled simply &quot;R. Eliezer&quot;), 
  and with reference to his legal acumen and judicial impartiality, the Scriptural 
  saying (Deut. xvi. 20), &quot;That which is altogether just [lit. &quot;Justice, 
  justice&quot;] shalt thou follow,&quot; was thus explained: &quot;Seek a reliable 
  court: go after R. Eliezer to Lydda, or after Johanan ben Zakkai to Beror ?el,&quot; 
  etc. (Sanh. 32b). Once he accompanied Gamaliel and Joshua on an embassy to Rome 
  (Yer. Sanh. vii. 25d; Deut. R. ii. 24).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eliezer's Conservatism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rabbi Eliezer was very severe and 
  somewhat domineering with his pupils and colleagues (see Sifra, Shemini, i. 
  33; 'Er. 68a; ?ag. 3b; Meg. 25b), a characteristic which led occasionally to 
  unpleasant encounters. The main feature of his teaching was a strict devotion 
  to tradition: he objected to allowing the Midrash or the paraphrastic interpretation 
  to pass as authority for religious practise. In this respect he sympathized 
  with the conservative school of Shammai, which was also opposed to giving too 
  much scope to the interpretation. Hence the assertion that he was a Shammaite, 
  though he was a disciple of R. Johanan ben Zakkai, who was one of Hillel's most 
  prominent pupils. This brought Eliezer into conflict with his colleagues and 
  contemporaries, who realized that such conservatism must be fatal to a proper 
  development of the oral law. It was also felt that the new circumstances, such 
  as the destruction of the Temple and the disappearance of the national independence, 
  required a strong religious central authority, to which individual opinion must 
  yield.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At last the rupture came. The Sanhedrin 
  deliberated on the susceptibility to Levitical uncleanness of an 'aknai-oven 
  (an oven consisting of tiles separated from one another by sand, but externally 
  plastered over with cement). The majority decided that such an oven was capable 
  of becoming unclean, but Eliezer dissented. As he thus acted in direct opposition 
  to the decision of the majority, it was deemed necessary to make an example 
  of him, AND HE WAS EXCOMMUNICATED. Still, even under these circumstances great 
  respect was manifested toward him, and the sentence was communicated to him 
  in a very considerate manner. Akiba, dressed in mourning, appeared before him 
  and, seated at some distance from him, respectfully addressed him with &quot;My 
  master, it appears to me that thy colleagues keep aloof from thee.&quot; Eliezer 
  readily took in the situation and submitted to the sentence (B. M. 59b; Yer. 
  M. ?. iii. 81a et seq.). Thenceforth Eliezer lived in retirement, removed from 
  the center of Jewish learning; though occasionally some of his disciples visited 
  him and informed him of the transactions of the Sanhedrin (Yad. iv. 3).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Relations with Christianity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the persecutions of the Jewish 
  Christians in Palestine, ELIEZER WAS CHARTGED WITH BEING A MEMBER OF THAT SECT, 
  and was summoned before the penal tribunal. Being asked by the governor, &quot;How 
  can a great man like thee engage in such idle things?&quot; he simply replied, 
  &quot;The judge is right.&quot; The judge, understanding thereby Eliezer's denial 
  of all connection with Christianity, released him, while Rabbi Eliezer understood 
  by &quot;judge&quot; God, justifying the judgment of God which had brought this 
  trial upon him. That he should be suspected of apostasy grieved him sorely; 
  and though some of his pupils tried to comfort him, he remained for some time 
  inconsolable. At last he remembered that once, while at Sepphoris, he had met 
  a sectary who communicated to him a singular halakah in the name of Jesus; that 
  he had approved of the halakah and had really enjoyed hearing it, and, he added, 
  &quot;Thereby I transgressed the injunction (Prov. v. 8), 'Remove thy way far 
  from her, and come not nigh the door of her house,' which the Rabbis apply to 
  sectarianism as well as to heresy&quot; ('Ab. Zarah 16b; Eccl. R. i. 8). The 
  suspicion of apostasy and the summons before the dreaded tribunal came, therefore, 
  as just punishment. This event in his life may have suggested to him the ethical 
  rule, &quot;Keep away from what is indecent and from that which appears to be 
  indecent&quot; (Tosef., ?ul. ii. 24). It is suggested that his sayings, &quot;Instructing 
  a woman in the Law is like teaching her blasphemy&quot; (Sotah iii. 4); &quot;Let 
  the Law be burned rather than entrusted to a woman&quot; (ib.); and &quot;A 
  woman's wisdom is limited to the handling of the distaff&quot; (Yoma 66b), also 
  date from that time, he having noticed that women were easily swayed in matters 
  of faith.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Separated from his colleagues and 
  excluded from the deliberations of the Sanhedrin, Eliezer passed his last years 
  of life unnoticed and in comparative solitude. It is probably from this melancholy 
  period that his aphorism dates: &quot;Let the honor of thy colleague [variant, 
  &quot;pupils&quot;] be as dear to thee as thine own, and be not easily moved 
  to anger. Repent one day before thy death. Warm thyself by the fire of the wise 
  men, but be cautious of their burning coals [= &quot;slight them not&quot;], 
  that thou be not burned; for their bite is the bite of a jackal, their sting 
  is that of a scorpion, their hissing is that of a snake, and all their words 
  are fiery coals&quot; (Ab. ii. 10; Ab. R. N. xv. 1). When asked how one can 
  determine the one day before his death, he answered: &quot;So much the more 
  must one repent daily, lest he die to-morrow; and it follows that he must spend 
  all his days in piety&quot; (Ab. R. N. l.c. 4; Shab. 153a).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His Death.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When his former colleagues heard 
  of his approaching dissolution, the most prominent of them hastened to his bedside 
  at C&aelig;sarea. When they appeared before him he began to complain about his 
  long isolation. They tried to mollify him by professing great and unabated respect 
  for him, and by averring that it was only the lack of opportunity that had kept 
  them away. He felt that they might have profited by his teaching. Thereupon 
  they besought him to communicate to them traditions concerning certain moot 
  points, particularly touching Levitical purity and impurity. He consented, and 
  answered question after question until all breath left him. The last word he 
  uttered was &quot;?ahor&quot; (&quot;pure&quot;), and this the sages considered 
  as an auspicious omen of his purity; whereupon they all rent their garments 
  in token of mourning, and R. Joshua revoked the sentence of excommunication.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eliezer died on a Friday, and after 
  the following Sabbath his remains were solemnly conveyed to Lydda, where he 
  had formerly conducted his academy, and there he was buried. Many and earnest 
  were the eulogies pronounced over his bier. R. Joshua is said to have kissed 
  the stone on which Eliezer used to sit while instructing his pupils, and to 
  have remarked, &quot;This stone represents Sinai [whence the Law was revealed]; 
  and he who sat on it represented the Ark of the Covenant&quot; (Cant. R. i. 
  3). R. Akiba applied to Eliezer the terms which Elisha had applied to Elijah 
  (II Kings ii. 12), and which Joash subsequently applied to Elisha himself (ib. 
  xiii. 14), &quot;O MY FATHER, MY FATHER, THE CHARIOT OF ISRAEL, AND THE HORSEMEN 
  THEREOF&quot; (Ab. R. N. xxv. 3).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though excommunicated, Eliezer is 
  quoted in the Mishnah, the Baraita, and the Talmudim more frequently than any 
  one of his colleagues. He is also made the putative author of Pir?e De-R. Eliezer 
  or Baraita of R. Eliezer, though internal evidence conclusively proves the late 
  origin of the work.</font></p>
