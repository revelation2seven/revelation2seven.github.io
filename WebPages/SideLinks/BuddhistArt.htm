<div align="center"><b>FROM THE HIMALAYAS, ART FOR YOUR SOUL'S SAKE</b> </div>
<p align="center">By Holland Cotter</p>
<p align="left"><b>It's easy to forget &#151; and museums will seldom remind you 
  &#151; that much of the art in most of the world before the modern era wasn't 
  made just to sit there looking pretty. It was made to save your soul.</b> Two 
  major museum presentations of Buddhist art in California are filled with art 
  of exactly this kind. One show pays only dutiful attention to that fact; the 
  other doesn't let you lose sight of it for a second.</p>
<p>&quot;<b>The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art&quot;</b> at the Los 
  Angeles County Museum of Art is a rarity for two reasons. It's a big, luxuriant 
  display of truly fabulous religious images, but tightly focused. <b>And it doubles 
  as a step-by-step guided trek over rigorous spiritual and intellectual terrain</b>.</p>
<p>Geographically, it might be said to begin and end in Nepal, at the Svayambhu, 
  the Great Stupa, near Katmandu. To reach the stupa, which is <b>a mound-shaped 
  reliquary thought to hold remains of the Buddha</b>, pilgrims and sightseers 
  climb flights of stone stairs winding up a wooded hill. Apart from the monkeys 
  looking for handouts, you might be in upstate New York. Then you round a corner 
  and, as if out of nowhere, there it is: this enormous spaceship staring down 
  at you with stern, alert eyes.</p>
<p>One of the oldest Buddhist monuments in the world, the Svayambhu is a solid, 
  whitewashed hemisphere of brick and packed rubble <b>surmounted by a square 
  tower painted with pairs of eyes on all four sides</b>. The tower itself is 
  topped by <b>a sun-catching gilded finial</b> from which strings of little flags 
  fly, like yachting colors. Prayer wheels line the stupa base. As you walk around 
  it, <b>you can set each wheel spinning with a sweep of your hand. At every rotation, 
  the idea is, prayers fly up</b>.</p>
<p>A splendid 18th-century copper model of the <b>Svayambhu &#151; the name means 
  self-arisen</b> &#151; appears a few galleries into the Los Angeles show. But 
  by then you've already been introduced to the Buddha and to Nepal, where he 
  was born in the fifth century B.C. <b>His mother, the queen of a tribal kingdom, 
  was traveling, the story goes, and delivered him in a roadside garden</b>. A 
  stone-relief depiction of the nativity scene, dating from the fifth or sixth 
  century A.D and on loan from the National Museum in Katmandu, is one of the 
  oldest pieces in the show.</p>
<p>Essentially Indian in style, the figures of the relief have a smooth, pliant 
  delicacy &#151; arms and legs are <b>like sapling branches</b> &#151; characteristic 
  of carving by Newar artists, members of the ethnic majority in the Katmandu 
  Valley and creators of some of the most beautiful Buddhist art ever made. In 
  fact, the presence of this piece, along with a dozen others on loan from Nepal's 
  national art collections, is a minor event in itself. The last time such things 
  came West was 40 years ago.</p>
<p>As with everything else in this gathering of nearly 150 sculptures, paintings, 
  illuminated books and ritual instruments, charisma is harnessed to an exposition 
  of ideas. <b>One of these ideas entails a rethinking of history.</b> In many 
  traditional accounts, Buddhism and its art make a flying leap from India, were 
  the Buddha spent his life, over the Himalayas to Tibet. Nepal, which lies between 
  the two, is more or less left out, its art viewed either as a raw mix of Hindu 
  and Buddhist elements or as a knockoff of Tibetan styles. The show proposes, 
  more emphatically than has been done elsewhere, that Nepal played a catalytic 
  role in that transmission, in the process developing beliefs, practices and 
  aesthetic styles from which Tibet benefited.</p>
<p><b>These fall under the general name of Tantric or Esoteric Buddhism, and it 
  is Tantric practice that forms the spine of the show</b>. <b>Spiritually speaking, 
  the crucial moment of the Buddha's life, the moment when he became a buddha, 
  was his enlightenment, the instant he fully internalized an existential concept 
  as plain as A, B, C but profound in its implications.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/BoTree.gif" width="350" height="458"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Under the Tree of Enlightenment</b></p>
<p><b>Humans beings want, want, want; and they want to keep what they get forever, 
  which, of course, they cannot do. So, to live is to exist in a state of constant 
  desire. To live in desire is, inevitably, to suffer loss and fear further loss. 
  To get beyond desire and pain, some alternative had to be found. And in that 
  moment, he found one.</b></p>
<p>But who could benefit from this information? Very early monastic Buddhism insisted 
  that to reach enlightenment required moving through countless turns of the reincarnation 
  cycle, and even then only a few strivers made the grade. <b>Later Buddhism said 
  that anyone willing to follow the teachings can be awakened in this life. Among 
  Tantric Buddhists, anyone willing to pursue a regime of ritual-intensive discipline 
  can reach enlightenment now and, in the process, benefit all other creatures, 
  which is the ultimate goal</b>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ChristMystery.gif" width="675" height="501"></p>
<p>This is where art comes in. The Tantric rituals require special tools. Some 
  of these are meant to be touched, held or worn; others are meant to be meditated 
  on. <b>Contact turns on two-way spiritual currents: the devotee imbues the object 
  with power; the object sends power zooming back.</b> And the other way around. 
  &quot;The Circle of Bliss&quot; asks us to consider nearly every item on view 
  in light of this electric interchange.</p>
<p>It's easiest to see in the case of hand-held ritual instruments, and those 
  assembled are visually riveting: pronged scepters that are like lightning rods 
  for attracting spiritual energies, hand bells that wake the slumbering mind, 
  goblets made from human skulls. <b>Drink deeply of death, they seem to say; 
  let its toxins pass through you, and out, carrying your ego with them.</b></p>
<p><b>Like any serious course of instruction, Tantra aims to focus you, expand 
  you; and it uses teaching aids to do so. The painted mandala is one. It's at 
  once visually logical and bafflingly complex; color-coded like a psychedelic 
  version of the New York City subway map, it's an aerial view of a deity's house 
  as vast as the cosmos.</b></p>
<p>Of the many mandalas in the show, I'll choose just one. Probably created by 
  Newar artists at a Tibetan monastery in the 15th century, it offers <b>a labyrinthine, 
  circles-within-squares topographic chart of heaven and hell,</b> bristling with 
  tiny sprites and monsters. <b>A Tantric teacher, a guru, who knows the image, 
  with its pitfalls and high places, will lead the committed student on a pilgrim's 
  progress to the mandala's center.</b> </p>
<p><b>There two deities, male and female, are locked in an amorous embrace. The 
  male is named Chakrasamvara, the female, Vajravarahi. Their intertwined bodies 
  are &quot;The Circle of Bliss.&quot; Separately they represent the forces of 
  wisdom and compassion; enlightenment is their union.</b> Astonishing examples 
  of these figures, separate and together, from Nepal, Tibet, India, China and 
  Mongolia, form the heart of the exhibition.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/KrishnaRhada.gif" width="500" height="402"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Dalet Vaw Dalet</b></p>
<p>I'm giving you the dummy's version of all of this, which is the one I know. 
  The function and meaning of mandalas and other such objects can be fully explained 
  only by an interpretive calculus of prodigious complexity, one untimately accessible 
  only to initiates.</p>
<p>But the fact of this art's spiritual utility &#151; how it works &#151; is 
  what the show is about. And its organizers &#151; Stephen Markel, the museum's 
  curator of South Asian art; John C. Huntington, a professor of art history at 
  Ohio State University in Columbus; and Dina Bangdel, a visiting assistant professor 
  at Ohio State and the daughter of the late Nepalese art historian Lain Singh 
  Bangdel &#151; demonstrate it with dogged, daring thoroughness, recreating the 
  steps of a specific meditational practice through a combination of art objects, 
  interpretive wall texts and computer-generated illustrations of theological 
  concepts.</p>
<p>As you can guess, the outcome is a very read-as-you-look affair, which is not 
  to everyone's taste. Some viewers will object that the curators have overarticulated 
  concepts at the expense of the objects and will choose to take one and leave 
  the other. Hard-core &quot;art speaks for itself&quot; advocates will be outraged 
  by the didactic interference.</p>
<p>My advice to them? Get over it. <b>If beauty were so self-evident</b>, the 
  South Asian galleries in every museum would be jammed with eager visitors all 
  the time. But they aren't, ever. In part this is because of visual unfamiliarity 
  of the &quot;Daddy why does that person have eight arms&quot; sort. <b>It's 
  also because certain Buddhist art, like any religious art &#151; and, for that 
  matter, much modern secular art &#151; is elaborately coded and will reveal 
  itself only when those codes are unlocked.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Magdaline.gif" width="616" height="259"></p>
<p>This is not to say that &quot;The Circle of Bliss&quot; is a &quot;religious&quot; 
  show. <b>It simply acknowledges, right up front, something we basically know: 
  that all art is, for better and for worse, trying to sell us something &#151; 
  pleasure, ideology, salvation, whatever.</b> The exhibition elucidates both 
  the message being sold in a particular art and the complex mechanics of its 
  delivery. If you find yourself attracted to that message, cool. If not, also 
  cool.</p>
<p>So, obviously, I have no problem with a didactic approach, at least when the 
  reading and the looking are as engrossing as they are here. And for those who 
  want more to read, there is a 600-page catalog with contributions by two dozen 
  of Mr. Huntington's graduate students. It's awesome. When the time comes to 
  hand out awards for art publications, it should rank high on the list of candidates. 
  (The book was produced by the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio, where the show, 
  which runs in Los Angeles through Jan. 4, will open on Feb. 9.)...</p>
<p>No exhibition involving international loans is a breeze to pull off these days. 
  The Los Angeles museum might have cut corners and cooked up a decent show from 
  its own fine Himalayan collection &#151; much of it assembled by a former curator, 
  Pratapaditya Pal, who almost single-handedly introduced this material to the 
  United States beginning in the 1960's &#151; but it did more. It not only brought 
  treasures from European and Asian institutions, which must have cost a bundle, 
  but did so in the interest of creating a risky, difficult project. Future scholars 
  will be grateful for this...</p>
<p><b>That art and those ideas are tremendous and exquisite. At their most complex, 
  they propose entire whirling universes of thought and emotion, with bells clanging, 
  lightning flashing. At their most basic, they offer a user's guide for a sane 
  life, greeted daily with unexpectant joy, its end met with unregretful equanimity. 
  Milarepa sang about this:</b></p>
<p><b>My mind has delighted in my teacher's counsel;<br>
  my mouth has delighted in singing songs of my soul;<br>
  my body has delighted in a cotton cloth from Nepal.<br>
  I have lived delighting, thus delighting.<br>
  Do ye also live rejoicing, thus rejoicing.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Either way, the ideas are far beyond most of us. But how invigorating and 
  reorienting to be brought into a close encounter with them. Sometimes their 
  vision is mild-mannered and humanly scaled, as in the Buddha's nativity. Sometimes 
  it is ferocious and incendiary, as in the Chakrasamvara embrace. Whatever its 
  temperament, it is embodied in art that was precision-tooled for hard labor 
  but that stops you in your tracks with a shock of beauty, as the Buddha's eyes 
  on the stupa do when you reach the top of the hill. </b></p>
