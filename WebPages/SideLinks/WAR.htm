<p><font size="+1">It is January, 2003. The words of the prophets are being fulfilled 
  before our very eyes. American forces are at this very moment assembling once 
  again in the Middle East. George Bush (he says he is a Christian, doesn't he)? 
  is threatening North Korea, and sneering at others in outright defiance of the 
  words at Romans 13, and <i>the day</i> is upon us. How is it that so few in 
  the Judeo-Christian and Islamic world are awake to these great age-ending matters? 
  Why are not millions more standing up alongside of those that are? Well of course, 
  it is the millions who sustain the present world-order, and who put this American 
  regime in power in the first place. (Well of course they didn't, it was God). 
  Thus the words: <i>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that 
  they shall believe a lie...</i>(2 Thessalonians 2:5-11; 1 Samuel, chapter 8):</font></p>

    mighty God, thou hast established them for correction...</font></i></p>

    glad.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefor they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense

  <p><i><font size="+1">Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually 
    to slay the nations?...</font></i><font size="+1">(Habakkuk 1:7-17).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE WAR OF THE KITTIM...&quot;In 
    a number of Qumran texts the Kittim appear as the last Gentile world power 
    to oppress the people of God. In the Habakkuk Commentary from cave 1 the prophet's 
    Chaldeans are understood to be the Kittim, sent by God to execute His judgments 
    on the godless rulers of Judea (think of the two World Wars) but destined 
    because of their unconscionable rapacity to be the subjects of His judgment 
    in their turn...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Kittim are a world power, pursuing 
    a career of conquest from the West. In their irresistible advance they overwhelm 
    all who stand in their way and bring them under their own rule. They take 
    possession of many lands and plunder the cities of the earth; they carry on 
    negotiations with other nations in a spirit of cunning and deceit; they lay 
    their subversive plans in advance and tolerate no opposition in carrying them 
    into execution. Their lust for conquest is insatiable; they mock at kings 
    and rulers...and their leaders follow one another in quick succession: They 
    come one after another to destroy the earth. This rapid succession happens 
    by 'the council of the guilty house,'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prophet's description of the 
    Chaldeans as catching men like fish and then paying divine honors to their 
    nets is said to denote the Kittim's practice of offering sacrifice to their 
    standards (the Flag)...and worshipping their weapons.&quot; </font>From a 
    Commentary on the Dead Sea Scrolls<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, 
    be diligent that ye might be found of him IN PEACE, WITHOUT SPOT, AND BLAMELESS</i>...(2 
    Peter 3:14).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">How did this happen? How did the people finally fall into the 
  clutches of these powerful merchant-warriors? When did it happen? Of course! 
  long before the Reformation and the eventual establishment of the American nation, 
  almost immediately after the Gospel of Peace and Non-violence was sown into 
  the hearts of men, and when others came right afterwards and devoured the seed 
  and destroyed the plants (Matthew, chapter 13). How did Paul say it: <i>For 
  the mystery of iniquity doth already work...</i>(2 Thessalonians 2:7).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have 
    gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Wherefore I take you to record this day, THAT I AM PURE 
    FROM THE BLOOD OF ALL MEN...</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In other words, those who came after Paul, having found justification 
  for the shedding of blood, the commission of war, or in any other wise the taking 
  of human life, no matter what the reason, did not learn it from Paul, nor can 
  it be found anywhere in his doctrine of Christ. The first-century Church taught 
  a doctrine of absolute pacifism--the precepts of Light and the ways of Abel, 
  in direct contrast to the precepts of Darkness and the doctrines of Cain...(James, 
  chapter 4...KJV. And then open the pages of the Book of 1 John, here in America, 
  in our own times):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For I have not shunned to declare unto you ALL the counsel 
    of God.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, 
    over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, 
    which He hath purchased with His own blood, </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(which 
    means, with the blood of the righteous in every generation, everywhere throughout 
    the earth)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For I know this, that after my departing shall grevious 
    Wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse 
    things, to draw away disciples after them.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three 
    years I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears...</font></i><font size="+1">(Acts 
    20:25-31).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What is it about war, besides the utter and primitive violence 
  of it, and besides the fact that those who wage it IN THE NAME OF CHRIST are 
  criminals against the very doctrine of Christ that they pretend to profess,

  itself?...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> What is it about war, besides the fact that God instructed 
  Moses (and therefore Christ) to set a barrier between the people and Himself, 
  commanding them to <i>come not up </i>when God Himself descended to the earth 
  in the sight of all men in the time of war (Exodus 19:10-18)?...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> What is it about war, beside the fact that God placed a great 
  distance between the children of Zion and Himself (an ocean in fact) to keep 
  them safe, when He himself, the God of War, rose up in the East to shake the 
  earth? It is this: </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Six thousand years ago at the time of Adam/Manu, a new awareness 
  appeared in the earth. It came as a revelation to humankind. In fact it is through 
  this revelation that the Creators set about to create the order of <i>Man </i>itself--a 
  new order of humanity in the earth. (We are now at the full-cycle end of that 
  creation process, and are only now coming to the fullest import of the words 
  in Genesis: <i>Let us create man in our image...</i>Genesis 2:26. We are at 
  this moment in time being created, being <i>fired</i> to perfection as it is, 
  in the image of Christ that is)....</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">What is it about war? It is this: When God appeared to that 
  human couple we know as Adam (six thousand, or 120 jubilees of years ago), Adam 
  themselves became the world's first <i>monotheists</i>. They were the very first 
  in the earth to receive a glimpse of God's Singular Presence in the universe. 
  They were the very first to realize that all things flow from the ONE. If night 
  and day are from the same source they reasoned, then it followed in their minds 
  that all other things--seemingly in opposition to each other--must also flow 
  from the same singular source. (It was a very simple but profound deduction). 
  They realized that if there is only One Power in the universe, then from that 
  One Power must come <i>ALL</i> things, including good <i>and </i>evil, and life 
  <i>and </i>death. The Mind of the Universe has confirmed these reasoning, many 
  times over the course of history, and is confirming them to the mind of Light 
  again in our time...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">See, I have set before you (again), Life and Good, and 
    Death and Evil...choose Life...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 30:15-19).</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For there are no powers but of God, the powers that be 
    are ordained of God...</font></i><font size="+1">(Romans 13).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">W</font><font size="+1">ith that revelation came a serious 
  obligation. Adam was, first of all, compelled to go to the people (who, in the 
  later allegorical and metaphorical interpretations of the sacred texts, became 
  their <i>church</i>. As Adam was the first christs, and Eve, the <i>woman</i>--all 
  the people to whom they were sent, and into whose consciousness they went to 
  sow the seed of this new understanding--was the first church...Ephesians 5:25-32, 
  KJV. Please see chapter 5). Thus they came to the people and expounded the doctrine 
  of ONE God, ONE Power--of God's Singular Presence in <i>all </i>things--an idea 
  which many of the people, and among them the most powerful, could not fully 
  grasp. The very same held true thousands of years later, in the time of Christ, 
  as Paul wrote: <i>The natural mind receiveth not the things of the Spirit of 
  God....</i>(1 Corinthians 2:13-16). Others, however, did understand, and some 
  of them to perfection. Those who could not (or would not) come to terms with 
  the simple, but sublime implications of these teachings became the progenitors 
  of the spirit of Cain in the earth--the one that God subsequently <i>marked</i> 
  because of his continued violence to others. This violence was in clear violation 
  of the teachings (or the <i>Torah, </i>the <i>Veda</i>) that had now come into 
  the earth (Genesis 4:13-16; Revelation 13:16-18). It is as Paul also wrote: 
  <i>For where no law is, there is no transgression</i> (Romans 4:15). Only the 
  children of Adam--those who heard these teachings then, and those who now profess 
  to be Jews and Christians, and Muslims (and in a very ancient sense Hindus)--are 
  capable of transgressing God's laws against killing and warfare, because it 
  is only to them that the law against such things has come. All of the other 
  families of humankind still belong to the older angelic order or are still in 
  flux between one order and the other. (2 Thessalonians 1:6-10)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Of course this must not be confused with the idea of race, 
  but rather must be understood in terms of structure and history, in terms of 
  the great circular direction the story of <i> Adam</i> has taken all these millennia. 
  For it is plain to see that individuals from every race of humankind, and every 
  religious tradition, have come into this circle, and that everywhere else throughout 
  the earth millions of others have put on the garments of non-violence and true 
  peace between themselves and others:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but 
    the doers of the law shall be justified.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature 
    the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto 
    themselves:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, 
    their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, 
    or else excusing one another,</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by 
    Jesus Christ according to my gospel...</font></i><font size="+1">(Romans 2:9-16)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Adam at that time reasoned with the people: &quot;Why do you 
  spend so much of your time in apprehension, making implements of war, spears 
  and arrows to protect yourselves...against what? Don't you know that you are 
  arming yourselves against God?&quot; &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; 
  the leaders said. &quot;Which god?&quot; There is only ONE Adam said. &quot;Are 
  you suggesting that we do not have to protect ourseves against those neighboring 
  tribes, as fierce and powerful (and as terror-prone) as they obviously are? 
  Are they not themselves a warrior band?&quot; &quot;Exactly! That's exactly 
  what we are saying, because...well because there is only ONE God, the ONE God 
  who dwells in all things, who dwells as magestically and powerfully, and even 
  moreso among them as He does among us. Only He (and we mean They--The Heavenly 
  Father and the Divine Mother) has revealed something to us that He has not revealed 
  to others yet. He wants us to see that He Himself (and you must try hard to 
  comprehend it), is indeed the <i>God of War</i> (Exodus 15:3), and that He himself 
  is indeed a <i>Consuming Fire </i>(Deuteronomy 4:24; Hebrews 12:29), which is 
  why all of these others tribes are as warlike as they are. God wants us to realize 
  that there is only one way we can defeat, or overcome Him, and thereby becoming 
  in the process exactly what He wants to create in us, and that is through <i>Peace</i>--not 
  talk of peace mind you, but the actual commission of peace itself. We must give 
  up our weapons, lay them aside and promise to never pick them up again (no matter 
  what happens in return) We must then go over to those other peoples and profess 
  our previous ignorance of Divine matters, and our realization that the One God 
  is indeed powerful, and that we know He dwells among them (in ways that they 
  themselves can not even understand) in the most Powerful way. We must go over 
  with the good things that our hands have made (not in fear but with courage). 
  We must go over as the servant-kings and priests the Creator wishes us to become, 
  and overcome both them, and our fear of them, in the only way that is possible, 
  through Love--enduring Love, self-sacrificing Love. When the One God who dwells 
  in them sees the Light that dwells in us, and is certain of the integrity of 
  our witness (when He sees us coming with the very words that He and She have 
  taught us), He will lay down His own arms and become one with us.&quot;...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But, alas, the seers were later to understand, this would not 
  happen in its most complete and earth-changing sense until the end of the age, 
  until an entire epic period of Six thousand years were fulfilled, until the 
  elements of both Light and Darkness that God created have worked themselves 
  out to perfection, and therefore until the One God who dwells in <i>all</i> 
  has risen up in the earth in His Most Powerful and Terrible Form (in the form 
  of Earth-shaking War itself), to liberate the Light. It is plain to see that 
  this is the only way that many will believe.&quot; And besides, many great and 
  marvellous wonders had still to unfold in the earth, things that were almost 
  beyond the imagination of those who lived in that time, things which we ourselves 
  are witness to in the 20th century. Those who refused to believe in those days, 
  and who could not fully understand what it was that Adam was saying, or what 
  God was beginning to bring to pass in the earth, reasoned to themselves, &quot;Why 
  then should we take such chances now? Why should we risk our own lives, or give 
  up our own possessions, if we can never in our own lifetimes realize the fruits 
  of our efforts? This is the reasoning of the children of Darkness, who went 
  on to become the mighty men of the earth, the Nimrods and Pharaohs, the Caesars 
  and eventually the kings of Europe, the religious leaders who have upheld and 
  supported them, and finally the most powerful antichrists of them all, the Presidents 
  of the United States of America. (</font><font size="+1">The United States of 
  America--a kingdom of nations and empires gathered together)...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Those who did believe, and who were able to understand, not 
  only the teachings of Adam but their own responsibility to those teachings, 
  became the first truly committed pacifists in the earth. They gave birth to 
  the spirit of Abel (the first living sacrifices in the earth, the first to willingly 
  lay down their own lives for an idea, for truth's sake, so that the process 
  of Creation could unfold). They became not only co-creators with God, but co-conspirators. 
  They became the seers and rishis of those earliest of times, and in time the 
  first of the Hebrew prophets--thus the first to purposely conceal through their 
  own literary methods, the deepest and highest meanings of their teachings and 
  on-going revelations from the mind of Darkness. Besides the art of allegory, 
  similitude and metaphor they devised and mastered a most peculiar discipline 
  of study, and the means of storing and relaying this information from one generation 
  to the next--the discipline and science of Kabbalah. One of its initiates wrote:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Underlying the ensuing Crusades 
    (and underlying countless other similar conflicts during the following centuries) 
    were characteristic assumptions. Crusaders go into battle for a religious 
    or supposedly-religious cause. Since their enemy stands for the forces of 
    evil, he must be defeated totally: there can be no compromise between righteousness 
    and wickedness. Ideally the enemy is vanquished by honourable means. But if 
    you hate an enemy who embodies error, and smite him indiscriminately, that 
    is quite excusable in the circumstances.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the centuries the crusader's 
    enemy has altered from the Muslims, to the Catholics or Protestants, to the 
    French revolutionaries, to the Germans or Allies, to the communists. But the 
    crusading mentality has remained consistent...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Older than the crusade, though 
    by no means so popular, is the second approach--the &quot;Just&quot; War. 
    </font>(This is the theory of war espoused by Jimmy Carter and the liberal, 
    intellectual elite of the Western religious world)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Although the idea was rooted in Roman Stoic philosophy, Ambrose and Augustine 
    </font>(whose doctrines also brought us disdain of women, and the Inquisition 
    several centuries later)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> formed 
    the just war into a Christian approach to the problem of warfare in the late 
    fourth century. Thomas Aquinas, the Spanish Dominican Francisco de Vitoria 
    and the Dutch Protestant Hugo Grotius developed it further.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The just war theory has come to 
    provide a series of criteria by which the permissibility of war in a particular 
    situation can be weighed. Some of these criteria have to do with the origins 
    of war: is there a just cause (for example, a clear injury which needs to 
    be redressed)? Has every reasonable attempt been made to get redress without 
    bloodshed? Will war be declared by a legitimate authority? </font>(Please 
    understand Isaiah 59)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Other criteria 
    concern the way in which the war is fought. Is it to be waged solely by by 
    legitimate and moral means? Is the damage which is likely to be incurred by 
    the war less grievous than the prior injury? Its success likely? </font>(These 
    are the reasonings of devilish, earth-born men)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the answer to these questions 
    are &quot;yes,&quot; one may justly declare war. Unfortunately this will entail 
    killing. But Augustine emphasized that this does not clash with loving the 
    enemy. What really matters are the intentions of the combatants' hearts. Although 
    these criteria for the just war may seem clear, in practice they have often 
    proved difficult to apply. Augustine's assumption that in any conflict justice 
    will lie mainly on one side is clearly wrong...It has rarely been clear who 
    has the insight and objectivity necessary to decide what justice means in 
    a given situation...Decisions about the meaning and application of justice 
    have almost always been made by the interested parties in the dispute. And 
    they in turn have used the criteria of the just war simply simply to justify 
    wars in which they were already engaged...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third and oldest Christian 
    approach to the war is pacifism. The Christian church of the first three centuries 
    was pacifist. The early Christians combined a simple obedience to the words 
    of Jesus...with a genuine international spirit..They were also repelled by 
    the idolatry which permeated the Roman army life...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the third centuries some Christians 
    were in the legions...Some Christian converts, however, left the forces upon 
    their conversion. Martin of Tours, following his conversion in 339, exclaimed, 
    &quot;I am Christ's soldier, I am not allowed to fight.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the triumph of Constantine 
    in the early fourth century, this early Christian pacifism withered rapidly. 
    In 392 the Emperor Theodosius declared Christianity to be the sole legal religion 
    in the empire; and in 416 all of the non-Christian troops were purged from 
    the Roman army. Only a few monks and mendicants remained pacifist, until the 
    Waldensians in thirteenth-century Italy and the Czech Brethren in the fifteenth 
    century revived pacifism. In the Protestant Reformation the Anabaptists were 
    the first to revive pacifism. Many of their emphases echoed the concerns of 
    the early church...but the Anabaptists added two new concerns. They denied 
    that the government may legitimately interfere with the reformation of the 
    church, and argued that the Christian is called to share in Christ's suffering 
    love for his enemies.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Anabaptists called all believers 
    to participate in a renewed society in which 'repentance was in evidence by 
    newness of life in Christ.' Nations would go on warring, but the regenerated 
    do not go to war.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center">THE GREEKS HAD A WORD FOR IRAQI VENGEANCE</p>
<p align="center">by James P. Pinkerton</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The word of the day is <i>ecpyrosis</i>. To the ancient Greeks, it meant 
    DESTRUCTION BY FIRE. The &quot;pyr&quot; root gives us the modern word &quot;pyromaniac.&quot; 
    But the Greeks also used ecpyrosis as a word for EXTREME COMBAT, as in to 
    be so consumed with fighting that one disappears, as it were, in a ball of 
    flame. There's some of that now, and there's more coming.</p>
  <p>President George W. Bush had a point on Monday when he stated of Iraqi suicide 
    bombers and rocket-attackers, &quot;They don't care who they kill. They just 
    want to kill.&quot; At one level, the terrorist resistance has a clear goal 
    of driving out all foreigners, regardless of their nationality or purpose 
    for being there. But at another level the killing has no goal whatsoever, 
    since it is spread far and wide across the whole of lawless Iraq, where street 
    crime and vengeance killings aren't even reported, let alone investigated. 
    That's ecpyrosis, the fire that's consuming Iraq.</p>
  <p>Men have been consumed by their violent passions since the beginning of time. 
    This is from Homer's Iliad: &quot;Achilles then sprang upon the Trojans with 
    a terrible cry...as a fire raging in some mountain glen after long draught...even 
    so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding his spear AS THOUGH HE WERE A GOD, 
    and giving chase to those whom he would slay, till the dark earth ran red 
    with blood...and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.&quot; Sometimes ecpyrosis 
    has a terrible poetic beauty to it.</p>
  <p>And there are other reasons for some to love ecpyrosis, too. Sigmund Freud 
    was no warmonger, but he observed pessimistically that combat &quot;lays bare 
    the primal man&quot; in each of us. And in that raw mental state, &quot;We 
    are, like primitive man, simply a gang of murderers.&quot; The military historian 
    Martin Van Creveld put it even more simply: &quot;However unpalatable the 
    fact, the real reason why we have wars is that men like fighting.&quot;</p>
  <p>It would be nice to believe that Americans are immune to such feelings. But 
    here's an item in Tuesday's San Francisco Chronicle, in which a homeless Vietnam 
    veteran was asked if he enjoyed killing. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; came the 
    answer. &quot;Because you have no idea the sense of power that you get from 
    killing someone. YOU ARE GOD. YOU ARE PLAYING GOD TO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING 
    THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU, AND YOUR KILLING WHATEVER IT IS.&quot;</p>
  <p>OK, so maybe some readers will dismiss the testimony of of a homeless vet 
    speaking to a Bay Area newspaper. Yet, how about The Toledo Blade? That's 
    about as Heartland as one can get. Earlier this month the Ohio paper ran a 
    long series recalling the 1967 operations of the 101st Airborne Division's 
    Tiger Force unit in Vietnam. The paper reported on the killings and massacres 
    of hundreds of civilians, adding goulish details--such as GIs stringing severed 
    ears around their necks as ornamentation. This is ecpyrosis, the sort of thing 
    that was depicted in movies such as &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;--or that really 
    happened in previously reported Vietnam incidents, such as the 1968 slaughter 
    ordered by Lt. William Calley in a village called My Lai.</p>
  <p>But the truly ecpyrotic comment in the Blade's series came from an ex-sergeant, 
    who recalled the death-defying, death-welcoming spirit of those gory days: 
    &quot;We didn't expect to live.&quot; That is, if one is going to die, then 
    everything is permitted. </p>
  <p>Indeed, after such experiences, ecpyrosis, TO BE CONSUMED BY FIRE, is sometimes 
    welcomed, almost as a cleansing--which was what the Greeks believed. Or the 
    Germans, and their Gotterdammerung legend, IN WHICH EVEN THE GODS PASSED INTO 
    THE INFERNO.</p>
  <p>Now back to Iraq. Bush no longer says &quot;bring em on,&quot; but he insists 
    that he will &quot;stay the course&quot; in Iraq. But the current posture--which 
    seems to consist of Americans being sitting ducks in compounds and convoys--is 
    not going to stop the attacks. What might stop them is a more aggressive campaign 
    that takes the fight to the terrorists, wherever they are. But, as anti-guerilla 
    wars from Spain to Algeria to Vietnam proved, such fighting degenerates into 
    carnage and chaos...And leads to <i>ecpyrosis</i>, our word for the day--and 
    for a long time to come. </p>

    discord between the enemies. They may be divided among themselves and torn

  one son against the other. But rather, He who is One is waging war against both--against 
  every soul, Jew, Christian and Muslim alike, who would literally lift up a sword 
  against his brother. Each is a judgment against the other. There is no commandment 
  in the higher Torah to literally slay one's enemy. The Torah is allegory, and 
  must be read as such. And how pathetic and sorrowful it is to hear someone, 
  particularly on the Jewish side of this equation, exclaim that God just worked 
  a miracle because one person out of 20 survived, and was not blown to bits in 
  the night club or in the shopping mall with all the rest. And though the Jews

      think of all the atrocities that America is guilty of--of which it must 
      give an account--and all the terrors it has visited upon the other peoples 
      of the earth in its rise to power. Think of colonial Virginia and New England. 
      Think of slavery and the South. Think of the crossing over into the Northwest 
      territories. Think of the rise of Industrialism and of America's unceasing 
      exploitation of the continent and its resources, and its massive consolidation 
      of power over the lives of others. Think of the Trail of Tears. Think of 
      Manifest Destiny and the transcontinental railroad. Think of lies and broken 
      treaties. Think of Sand Creek and Wounded Knee. Think of Hawaii. Think of 
      Panama, the School of the Americas, and then Central America. Think of the 
      American Corporate State, the CIA, human experiments, insurrections, revolutions, 
      the downfall of governments, the Shah, the Contras, the rise of the Muhajadeen. 
      Think of every single death that America is directly responsible for, of 
      every man, woman and child who has ever stood in the way of America's commercial 
      interests and Corporate America's rise to power in the earth. And do not 
      be beguiled by notions of America's Christian heritage. If it were so then 
      none of these things would have happened, and not one person anywhere would 
      have suffered injustices or perished in the name of Christ. On the contrary,

  <p align="left"> In the opening scene of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, 
    we see Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane engaged in a battle of wills versus 
    Satan. As Satan attempts to plant a seed of doubt in Jesus's heart, the serpent 
    enters the Garden and slowly slithers towards Jesus. Suddenly, an expression 
    of resolute calm comes over Jesus's face. He stands...and shockingly crushes 
    the serpent's skull with a stomp of his foot...</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"> Upon witnessing this sudden act of violence on the part of 
    Christ, many members of the audience let out startled cries of surprise and 
    disbelief. I remember that this particular scene bothered me more than anything 
    else in the movie, including Jesus's prolonged torture and murder. I must 
    forthrightly say that I am not a religious person; in fact, I have never set 
    foot in a place of worship or religious observance (at least not voluntarily). 
    With that said, if I were a betting man, I'd stake every penny in my pocket 
    that Jesus would not have taken the life of even the &quot;lowest&quot; creature 
    in God's Creation. Not a worm, not a bug...not even a slimy serpent. JESUS 
    WAS A PACIFIST CONTINUOUSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY. Ironically, just a moment 
    later in the film, we see my theory put to the test. The Romans locate Jesus 
    and attempt to take him captive, upon which Jesus's disciples offer violent 
    resistance. Jesus, however, remains passive, even if his non-resistance means 
    the death of his good friends. Even when they've gained the upper hand, Jesus 
    tells his followers, &quot;Those who live by the sword shall die by the sword.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p align="left">I found Jesus's passivity more moving than anything I'd previously 
    witnessed in film. He begs forgiveness for his torturers, exclaiming to God, 
    &quot;Oh, forgive them, Father! They don't know what they do!&quot; I cannot 
    quote from the Bible with anything approaching literacy, but as the product 
    of a Christian nation, a few choice lines do stand out in my memory. I feel 
    a deep resonance with the words, &quot;Do unto others as you would have them 
    do unto you,&quot; AND, &quot;Judge not lest ye be judge,&quot; and most notably, 
    my favorite of the Ten Commandments, &quot;Thou shalt not kill.&quot; These 
    words are so elementary and uncompromising that one would think they could 
    never be a source of confusion. But surprisingly few people, including the 
    most allegedly devout of Christians, seem capable of understanding the most 
    basic of God's instructions. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The words, &quot;Thou shalt not kill,&quot; could not have been 
    more plainly written. Notice God did not add any conditions or caveats to 
    this COMMAND. He did not say, &quot;Thou shalt not kill...Christians, Americans, 
    the law-abiding, the righteous, the good, the innocent, the attractive, the 
    educated, the wealthy, the able-bodied, the smart, the charismatic, the well-clothed, 
    the height-weight proportional, the hygienic...&quot; Nor did He even say, 
    &quot;Thou shalt not kill HUMANS.&quot; God's Commandment - absolute and unambiguous 
    - is that ALL Life is touched by the Divine spark. As the children of God, 
    we did not CREATE Life, so it is not within our moral authority to take it 
    away. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Like everything else in life, God's words are made &quot;confusing&quot; 
    by the MORAL RELATIVISM of our &quot;great thinkers.&quot; Through all of 
    history, mankind has found legal and &quot;moral&quot; justification for the 
    selective extinguishing of Life -constant warfare stands out as the defining 
    characteristic of the human condition. I will KILL this person because he 
    has wronged me and my family, my community, my country, my religion. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">In 21st century America, we see moral relativism as the underlying 
    cause of a culture of DEATH. The rule of &quot;law&quot; says that Life can 
    be taken when: 1) the Life is not &quot;worth living,&quot; because the life 
    is &quot;contemptible&quot; (euthanasia, the Terry Schiavo case); 2) the Life 
    is &quot;inferior&quot; and poses an inconvenience to a &quot;superior&quot; 
    Life (abortion); 3) the Life is &quot;evil&quot; and/or poses a threat to 
    innocent life (capital punishment, the war on terror); 4) the Life is not 
    HUMAN (the perpetual slaughter of all animal life, including the food industry.) 
    But I have been told by Bill O' Reilly that America is a fundamentally CHRISTIAN 
    nation. Are these instances of legalized murder consistent with the most FUNDAMENTAL 
    principle of Christianity? Jesus stood as a passive observer even though by 
    doing so he ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS. His words, &quot;Those 
    who live by the sword shall die by the sword,&quot; implied that even those 
    who kill to PROTECT THE INNOCENT are only contributing to the endless perpetuation 
    of violence and death. This lesson is apparently lost on many self-described 
    Christians who view justifiable homicide (including warfare) as their happiest 
    duty. </p>
  <p align="left">Christ's teachings are clearly predicated on one simple fact: 
    as human beings we are NOT CAPABLE of delineating between a &quot;worthy&quot; 
    Life and an &quot;unworthy&quot; Life. Look at the things we view as &quot;admirable&quot; 
    in other people: namely fame, fortune, and physical attractiveness. Are these 
    things of any import to God? Does God view the invalid as less than the able-bodied, 
    the poor as less than the wealthy, the &quot;ugly&quot; as less than the attractive? 
    The transparentness of our own insanity is the greatest evidence that the 
    taking of ANY Life is the domain of God, and God alone. If American policy 
    makers - the senators, the governors, the congressmen, the Supreme Court justices, 
    and the President -lived in CONTINUOUS and UNCOMPROMISING observance of the 
    Commandment, &quot;Thou shalt not kill,&quot; would evil in the world be more 
    or less prevalent? </p>
