<p align="center">IRISH CHRISTIANITY BEFORE PATRICK</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While St. Patrick was unquestionably 
    the evangeliser of Ireland, there is now hardly a doubt remaining in the minds 
    of scholars that Christianity had a foothold on the Island before he came--and 
    long before some think.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In A.D. 431, a year before the 
    coming of Patrick on his Christian mission, Palladius (who, by one authority, 
    John Sichard, is even said to have been himself an Irishman) was sent by the 
    Pope &quot;ad Scotus in Christum credente&quot;--to the Irish believing in 
    Christ--which words clearly show Rome to have been impressed with the fact 
    that the Irish Christians then were of some numerical importance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is universally admitted,&quot; 
    says George Stokes, &quot;that there were Christian congregations in Ireland 
    before Palladius came.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is an interesting curiosity 
    to find told among the ancients--as recorded by Eusebius and Nicephorus--that 
    some of the Apostles visited the Western Islands. Julian of Toledo says that 
    James addressed a canonical letter from Ireland and that when he returned 
    to Jerusalem--where he was martyred--he took with him Seven Irish disciples.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Usher quotes Nicephorus' Ecclesiastical 
    History as saying that Simon Zelotus brought the Gospel to these islands, 
    and was crucified in Britain. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ST. PAUL IS ALSO MENTIONED AS HAVING 
    BEEN TO THESE WESTERN LANDS. </font>(And to the North American continent as 
    well...think of <i>Quetzlecoatel</i>, the <i>feathered serpent</i>).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reference has been made to the 
    tradition of Conal Cearnach's visit to Jerusalem. Richardson (<i>Prael. Ecc. 
    History)</i> says he brought back the faith to Conor MacNessa and others of 
    the <i>Ultach</i>, and that several Irish went to Jerusalem to be baptised 
    </font>(<i>Let the reader understand...</i>Matthew 24:15)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bollandus says that Palladius probably 
    found in Ireland more Christians than he made. And that some Irish Christians 
    figured prominently on the Continent of Europe in the pre-Patrician days is 
    fairly well established by Continental records. &quot;It is evident,&quot; 
    says Dr. Todd, &quot;there were Irish Christians on the Continent of Europe 
    before the mission of St. Patrick, some of whom had attained to considerable 
    literary and ecclesiastical eminence.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At all events it is a safe conclusion 
    that there were groups of Christians in Ireland when Palladius, preceding 
    St. Patrick, came...He stayed only a short time--and this is additional evidence 
    of his having found Christians there--he had found three churches before he 
    left. He departed in the same year--some say driven out by a Leinster chieftain, 
    Nathi--and went to Alba, where he died. It was on the news reaching Rome of 
    his departure from Ireland and his death that permission was given to Patrick 
    to follow his heart's desire, and, answering cries which he had heard in his 
    dreams from the children of Focluit Woods, go to the evangelizing of the people 
    whom he loved. </font>The Story of the Irish Race, by Seumas MacManus, pp.103-108<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">That that form of Christian doctrine which came to Ireland 
  in the time of the Apostles (as well as throughout other areas of Central and 
  Northern Europe), was wholly mystical and transcendent (kabbalistic)--thus more 
  Vedic, thus more Buddhist, thus more Druidical in nature than Roman--is evidenced...well, 
  first of all, we find evidence of it in the pages that history has left blank. 
  We find evidence for it in the unwritten accounts of the period that transpired 
  between the first century and almost three hundred years later when Patrick 
  came to Ireland. It is evidenced in the fact that by the time of Patrick, historians 
  can no longer distinguish certain remnants of the early Celtic Church from the 
  Druids it is said that Patrick encountered. What he, and Palladius before him, 
  actually encountered upon their arrival was a form of Christianity that, though 
  vibrant in its own rite, was still connected to many of its old Druidical ways, 
  to the oral traditions that governed the Druid order just prior to the coming 
  of Christ. It was the immediate kinship between the old order, however, and 
  the new Christian order that the Apostles brought with them in the first century, 
  that made it possible for the Druids to accommodate the new teachings. And it 
  was the still-existing kinship between their present, Druidical form of Christianity--which 
  Patrick largely adopted upon his arrival--and the form Patrick brought with 
  him, that made it actually possible for Patrick to eventually (re)evangelize 
  the Irish people. The &quot;Druid&quot; reactions against Christianity that 
  we read of, were not against the Gospels, they possessed some of its earliest 
  transcripts, but against Rome's imperious interpretations of them. Patrick was 
  wise enough in his time to leave Rome behind. Nevertheless, there were Druids, 
  and there were Druids:</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DRUIDISM AND 
        CHRISTIANITY</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Certain writers on Druidism...have 
    created an impression that the Druids eagerly and almost joyfully accepted 
    the Christian faith on its appearance in Ireland and Scotland and that they 
    even regarded it is a fulfillment of their own. But the very reverse appears 
    to have been the case. The Irish Druids appear to have been strongly opposed 
    to St. Patrick and his coadjutors, while those of Scotland revealed the most 
    vigorous hostility to Columba, deriding his powers and seeking to neutralize 
    his conversion of the people. In all likelihood, Patrick took up a position 
    analogous to that assumed at a later date in South Britain by Augustine (not 
    of Hippo), engrafting his primitive Christianity upon the body of Druidic 
    paganism. Dr. Donovan, editor of <i>The Annals of the Four Masters</i>, remarks 
    that: &quot;Nothing is clearer than that Patrick engrafted Christianity on 
    the pagan superstition with so much skill that he won people over to the Christian 
    religion before they understood the exact difference between the two systems 
    of belief.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sir John Rhys says that: &quot;Irish 
    Druidism absorbed a certain amount of Christianity, and it would be a problem 
    of considerable difficulty to fix on the point where it ceased to be Druidism 
    and from which onwards it could be said to be Christianity in any restricted 
    sense of that term.&quot; The Irish Goidel's faith in Druidism was never suddenly 
    undermined. In the saints he beheld only more powerful Druids and Christ, 
    in his eyes, took the place of the Druids.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The struggle betwixt the early 
    Christian missionaries, thought Miss Hull, &quot;was a real and long one.&quot; 
    The Druids fought a bitter fight against the new faith. &quot;It is likely 
    that as time went on the Christian teachers felt it necessary to pretend to 
    all the qualities and powers possessed by the Druids. (see Luke 9:1; 10:19-22). 
    But it is too frequently forgotten that early Christianity, especially in 
    its &quot;Colonial&quot; forms, was often in itself of a very debased type, 
    such as would readily fuse with a faith like Druidism and indeed it appears 
    to have been chiefly because their miraculous powers as enchanters surpassed 
    those of the Druids that its ministers prevailed. One sometimes wonders how 
    the modern Christian would regard the faith of his distant predecessors could 
    he behold it in actual practice and it is probably as well that in the majority 
    of cases he knows little or nothing of that phase of it. When the Druids of 
    Ireland chanted their charms against St. Senan and environed him in mists 
    and horrid darkness, he exclaimed: &quot;Stronger is the spell that I have 
    brought with me, and better is my lore.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Canon Warren, writing on the conversion 
    of the Irish Celts, has commented upon &quot;the curious policy of the Druids 
    concerning the advent of St. Patrick, betraying in its language some acquaintance 
    with the ritual of the Christian church.&quot; That there were Christians 
    in Ireland before Patrick we know from the <i>Chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine,</i> 
    but that the Druids of Ireland, in the fifth century, knew all there was to 
    know concerning Christianity is scarcely to be gainsaid.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we have also to consider the 
    theory that the Druids of Ireland and Scotland carried on a Christianized 
    form of their faith under the name of &quot;Culdees.&quot; The name &quot;Culdee&quot; 
    seems to be derived from <i>ce'le de'</i>, &quot;servant of God,&quot; and 
    we may safely ignore the more fanciful etymologies of it. </font>(I wonder 
    if he is referring to Conor MacDari&quot;s contention that the word comes 
    from the Old Irish word &quot;caul,&quot; meaning a veil, or hidden)?<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    A tradition existed that &quot;the Culdees succeeded the druids at no great 
    distance of time,&quot; and a good deal of evidence of a certain kind has 
    been amassed which might seem to support the belief that they were persons 
    of Druidic faith who had adopted the Christian doctrine and life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Culdees seem to have recognized 
    the Old Celtic form of a tonsure. The Second Council of Chalons denounced 
    them as heretics in the year 813 and the fifth Canon of Coel-Hythe decreed 
    in 816 that they were not permitted to to function as priests in England. 
    They seem to have worshipped in a part of the Church of St. Regulus at St. 
    Andrews until the year 1124, when this privilege was withdrawn from them...In 
    my opinion they were the servants of the early British Celtic Church who stood 
    apart from the pretensions of the Roman bishops to hegemony over the Christian 
    Church as a whole...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beda regarded the Culdees of his 
    day as heretical, and Archbishop Lanfranc was horrified because they did not 
    pray to the saints and refused to recognize the Roman service. St Bernard 
    stigmatized them as &quot;beasts, absolute barbarians...Christian in name, 
    but really pagans.&quot; They actually committed THE UNSPEAKABLE CRIME OF 
    MARRIAGE!...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wonderful it is indeed to read 
    of and witness the follies of men who know all that is to be known concerning 
    the faith they profess, excepting the very articles of its origin, and those 
    distortions of thought and superstition which transformed its original purity 
    into the semblance of that very paganism which they abhor.&quot; </font>Druids,

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;St. Patrick had a rival for 
    his country's affections, one who flew around Ireland in a ramshackle chariot 
    and spun a web of miracles as far-flung as his own. But the most extraordinary 
    thing about Patrick's white-cloaked competitor had nothing to do with faith 
    or miracles. Patrick's rival was a woman.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bridget was no ordinary fifth-century 
    saint. Daughter of a chieftain, raised by a Druid, she displayed a free-spirited 
    independence that puts modern day feminists to shame.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 1,500 years later, her stamp 
    on Ireland is strong. Her distinctive crooked cross, woven from rushes, hangs 
    over thresholds and stables around the country. A cathedral now stands on 
    the ancient site of her monastery in Kildare. Young girl scouts are called 
    Brigini, Irish for &quot;little Bridgets.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In her day, Bridget shouldered 
    the usual saintly workload. She cured the sick, fed the hungry and roamed 
    the country converting souls...So goes the legend of Bridget. Who she really 
    was or what she truly accomplished is the subject of endless folk tales, and 
    fierce historical debate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is known is that an abbess 
    called Bridget built a thriving monastic settlement about 30 miles southwest 
    of Dublin. Catering to nuns and priests, it became a point of pilgrimage for 
    thousands.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The monastery was called Cill Dara, 
    &quot;Church of the Oak&quot; in Irish. It rivaled Patrick's church in size 
    and prestige. Today a stone tower reaches into the mist at Kildare. From the 
    top Bridget supposedly gazed at the Seven ancient kingdoms of Ireland. Never 
    mind that such towers didn't exist until a few centuries later. Like many 
    of the legends surrounding Bridget, historical accuracy isn't all that is 
    stretched.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bridget first appears in the writings 
    of Cogitosus, a fifth-century scribe, who lavishly recorded the goings-on 
    at Cill Dara. It was the late 400s, a few decades after Patrick had summoned 
    up all the (serpents) in Ireland, clapped them into a box, and hurled them 
    into the Irish Sea. </font>(An allusion to Patrick's vanquishing the old Druid 
    order)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. He was still busy preaching 
    and converting, using the three green leaves and single stem of the shamrock 
    to explain the holy trinity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cill Dara had to compete for pilgrims, 
    and Cogitosus did his best to oblige. Bridget is described as &quot;a maiden 
    of most beautiful and generous disposition&quot; who glided through homes, 
    fields and churches performing miracles at every turn...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But even for Cogitosus, Bridget 
    posed a problem. There was talk of a pagan cult long before the saint's time--one 
    that worshipped fire. Later writers describe a women-only enclosure at Cill 
    Dara, where nuns tended a perpetual flame. And what of those sacred wells 
    scattered around the hills and valleys, dedicated to a goddess called Brid?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Crone.gif" width="500" height="293"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The evidence looks like we 
    are dealing with the cult of a pagan goddess assimilated into Christianity,&quot; 
    says Kim McCone, professor of Old and Middle Irish at the National University 
    of Ireland. Like other historians, he questions the very existence of the 
    saint. Still, there seems little doubt that an abbess called Bridget ran a 
    monastery at Cill Dara. And in the fifth century, for a woman to have such 
    power was nothing short of miraculous.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Two excellent and popular works on this period of history, 
  and on the religious transformation that took place at that time between the 
  old order of things and the new (one fictional and one not) are: <i>The Mist 
  of Avalon</i>, by Marion Zimmer Bradley, and <i>How the Irish Saved Civilization</i>, 
  by Thomas Cahill:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Throughout the Roman world, 
    Christianity had accompanied Romanization. Its spread through the empire cannot 
    be understood apart from Romanization. Just as the subject peoples had wanted 
    to be Roman, they came quickly to understand that they wanted to be Christian, 
    too. From the fourth century on, instruction in Christianity could even serve 
    as a shortcut to Romanization, as joining the Episcopalians was till recently 
    a shortcut to respectability in America. Once the emperor had conferred on 
    Christianity its position of privilege, most Romans had little difficulty 
    in reading this sign of the times for what it was and grasping that their 
    own best interest lay in church membership...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patrick</font> (the nephew, we 
    are told, of the Roman warrior turned pacifist, St. Martin of Tours), <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">held 
    out to these warrior children, in his own person, a living alternative. It 
    is possible to be brave--to expect &quot;every day...to be murdered, betrayed, 
    enslaved; whatever may come my way&quot;--and yet be a man of peace and at 
    peace, a man without sword or desire to harm, a man in whom the sharp fear 
    of death has been smoothed away. He was &quot;not afraid of any of these things, 
    because of the promises of heaven; for I have put myself in the hands of God 
    Almighty.&quot; Patrick's peace was no sham: it issued from his person like 
    a fragrance...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patrick could put himself--imaginatively--in 
    the position of the Irish. To him, no less to them, the world is full of magic. 
    One can invoke the elements--the lights of heaven, the waves of the sea, the 
    birds and the animals--and these will come to one's aid, as in the incantation 
    of the <i>Breastplate</i>...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This magical world, though full 
    of adventure and surprise, is no longer full of dread. Rather, Christ has 
    trodden all the pathways before us, and at every crossroads and by every tree 
    the Word of God speaks out. We have only to be quiet and listen, as Patrick 
    learned to do during the silence of his &quot;novitiate&quot; as a shepherd 
    on the slopes of <i>Sliabh Mis</i>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This sense of the world as holy, 
    as the Book of God--as a healing mystery, fraught with divine messages--could 
    never have risen out of Greco-Roman civilization, threaded with the profound 
    pessimism of the ancients and their Platonic (Augustinian) suspicion of the 
    body as unholy and the world as devoid of meaning...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> From the celebratory spirit of 
    the <i>Breastplate</i> will spring the characteristic art and poetry of the 
    western world--the immense symbolic power of medieval liturgy, the smiling 
    angels of Gothic art, the laughable demons, the sweetness of poets like Francis 
    of Assisi (whose <i>Canticles of the Sun</i> could almost be mistaken for 
    a Celtic poem), Dante (who spoke of &quot;the love that moves the sun and 
    the other stars&quot;)...to the Christian druidism of Seamus Heaney, who to 
    this day is carving our poems that might stop even Derdriu in her tracks...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">None of this should be surprising 
    if we assume that there were characteristic aspects of Irish culture that 
    Patrick had taken to heart and on which he had chosen to build his new Christianity...(He 
    was already impressed) by the natural mysticism of the Irish, which already 
    told them that the world was holy--all the world, not just parts of it. It 
    was on this sturdy insight that Patrick choreographed the sacred dance of 
    Irish sacramental life, a sacramentality not limited to the symbolic actions 
    of the church's liturgy but open to the whole created universe. All the world 
    was holy, and so was all the body.&quot; </font> How the Irish Saved Civilization,

    long before the Catholicism so graphically portrayed in Frank Mc Court's <i>Angela's 
    Ashes </i>took hold in Ireland. <i> </i>Indeed, it symbolizes a mystery which 
    both God and the early Keltic Church hid from Rome itself. </p>

<p><font size="+1">In Zimmer-Bradley's novel we discover another (not exactly 
  fictional) face of the Divine Mother. She has already passed out of Her Universal 
  Form into Christianity while standing at the Foot of the Cross, in the person 
  of Miriam, or Mary. Who is She but <i>Mare</i>, the very Waters of Life Herself? 
  She is the Amniotic Soul of the Planet Herself who brings forth Her own fruit 
  in Her own times, in Her own purely Feminine way. Zimmer-Bradley also has Bridget 
  assuming the persona of the Christian Mary as the more ancient Druidical aspects 
  of the Christ-mystery fade into the past, into <i>the mist of time</i> as the 
  author so artfully tells the story. But the Ancient Mother will not be totally 
  lost to us outside of the figure of Mary (or Bridget). She will appear elsewhere 
  in the mystical (oral) traditions that were now attending the Gospels. As the<i> 
  Mystery of Iniquity </i>(the <i>Mystery of Imbalance</i>--the age of male domination...2 
  Thess.2:7) overshadows the earth She will become the Lady of the Lake, and Her

    firmament he saw was held up by four winged beasts rather than by poles or 
    pillars: a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle/scorpion. Those beasts, blazing 
    with heavenly light, are the symbols of four of the twelve signs of the Zodiac 
    The man is the constellation Aquarius, the lion is Leo, the ox is Taurus, 
    and we now call the eagle Scorpio. </font>(Understand Ezekiel 2:6)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    If you want to use the starry sky to signify the everlasting Throne of God, 
    you have to specify these four constellations in particular because they are 
    'fixed'; when the Sun appears to be traveling their sectors of the sky, you're 
    in the middle of a definite season, and the weather is steady and fairly predictable. 
    The other signs represented change of one kind or another, but with a fixed 
    sign, the whole universe seems to be stable, definite, and unchanging. (When 
    the Sun is in Leo, you're always in the middle of summer for instance)....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if these four beasts symbolize 
    the four immovable pillars that hold up the vault of heaven, the four supports 
    of the Throne of God; if they're the beings that carry the visible splendor 
    of God to humans--then they are also the prefiguration of Matthew, Mark, Luke, 
    and John...Thus the four beasts of Ezekiel's vision became the emblems of

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Full of adventure and excitement, 
    of wonders and enchantments, the stories of the Grail are particularly enthralling 
    for their air of mystery, of some tremendous secret that is hinted at but 
    not revealed. We are not told exactly what the Grail means. It is unimaginably 
    sacred, unimaginably precious. It is the fruit of blessedness...the centre 
    of high secrets and mysteries...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The origins of the Grail have been 
    searched for in Christianity, in paganism, in Byzantine, Persian, Jewish, 
    and Mohammedan traditions. Traces of gnostic ideas have been revealed, and 
    hints of possible Templar and Cathar influences...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The (various) stories contradict 
    each other because there is no single Grail legend but a number of variants 
    embroidering on not one but several themes. They tend to be rambling and inconsistent 
    because they were originally told, not written. They are part of the larger 
    mass of Arthurian legends, with their remote origins in Celtic paganism spread 
    throughout Western Europe by traveling story-tellers who altered the stories, 
    forgetting or misunderstanding parts of them, inventing other parts, and giving 
    the tales a new emphasis and a new significance. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shorn for the moment of most of 
    their enticing details, the Grail Legends are basically about a knight who 
    comes to an eerie and magnificent castle which is the home of a crippled king, 
    the Fisher King, or Maimed King. (Compare Isaiah 53:4-6; Matthew 4:19). In 
    the castle the hero sees a magic sword and a lance which is (still) dripping 
    with blood. During a lavish feast he sees the Grail itself, variously described 
    as a dish, a cup, a ciborium (the vessel in which the sacred host is kept, 
    a cup with an arched cover surmounted by a cross), or even as a stone. The 
    Grail is carried in procession during the feast, or sometimes itself serves 
    the feast. The hero is supposed to ask a question...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both the lance and the Grail have 
    now been connected with the blood of Jesus, the blood which was spilled to 
    save men from death and the devil. The Grail itself has been identified as

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CHICAGO__More than 160 Roman Catholic 
    priests in the Milwaukee Archdiocese have signed copies of a letter calling 
    on the church to allow married men to join the priesthood. The letter, which 
    the Rev. Joe Auldermauer mailed to the leaders of the United States Conference 
    of Catholic Bishops, cited the shortage of priests as a central reason to 
    make celibacy optional...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The primary motive for our 
    urging this change is our pastoral concern that the Catholic Church needs 
    more candidates for the priesthood, SO THAT THE CHURCH'S SACRAMENTAL LIFE 
    MIGHT CONTINUE TO FLOURISH,&quot; the letter stated. &quot;We speak out at 
    this time also because of our ever-growing appreciation of marriage and its 
    many blessings SO COMPATIBLE WITH PRIESTHOOD AND EVEN ENHANCING OF PRIESTLY 
    MINISTRY.&quot;</font></p>

    Catholic priests has been weighed many times before and was vigorously debated 
    within the American church in the late 1960s and early 70s. But the size of 
    the clergy's support for the Milwaukee letter is notable, Father Silva said...The 
    response elsewhere may, ultimately, be...muted, said the Rev. Thomas Reese, 
    editor of the Jesuit magazine America. &quot;This kind of thing was common 
    a few decades ago,&quot; Father Reese said. &quot;It never went anywhere except

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Dear Editor: I hope that 
    none of your readers were shocked by the survey (July 26) in the Rochester 
    area that suggested as many as 65% of Catholics do not believe in the true 
    presence. I was not shocked, were you?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even if you are lucky enough to 
    reside in a parish where the doctrine is both known and preached, you have 
    probably come upon Catholic clergymen who sure did not make the Eucharist 
    a major topic of sermons...Over the last three decades, many of our leaders 
    have treated the Last Supper as a buffet and picked and chose from Our Lord's 
    teachings those items which correspond to their own notions and the issues 
    of the day. Instead of teaching the divinity, they spoke on diversity, </font>(Of 
    all individuals being one in Christ)?<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    In place of revelation some emphasized revolution. </font>(Of all being transformed 
    by the renewal of the heart and mind? Of overcoming and coming out of the 
    present political and religious order of things?...Revelation 18)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    and the time that might have been devoted to the Eucharist was spent on the 
    environment. </font>(The Holy Environment? The Sacred Earth? The Presence 
    of God who is All and Fills All)?...</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Religion has to do with wisdom...the 
    first principles. Where did we come from? What are we? where are we going? 
    If the lesser sciences are the essence of religion then Jesus was wasting 
    his time...If the good people of Rochester are ignorant of the Eucharist, 
    its our fault. We priests have failed. Too long we have been casual about 
    the Blessed Sacrament. Perhaps the liturgy has become show business...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We and the Hebrews believe that 
    the Lord, whose name they never spoke, dwelt in the Temple in Jerusalem. There 
    was an outer court to the Temple which anyone could enter, then a space reserved 
    for the Jews and an area solely for Hebrew men, then a sanctuary accessible 
    to priests alone and finally the inner sanctum...The Holy of Holies....where 
    God dwelt. Here was the Ark in which the stone tablets had rested along with 
    Moses' staff and some manna. Here the High Priest alone could enter. And this 
    but once a year. So sacred.&quot; </font>A Catholic Weekly Newspaper<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
