    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JERUSALEM__On the eve of the 
      anniversary of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel staged its first airstrike 
      on Syria in 30 years -- dropping 1,000-pound bombs on what the army called 
      an Islamic Jihad training base. The attack on the Ein Saheb camp, 14 miles 
      northwest of Damascus, came a day after an Islamic Jihad suicide bomber 
      killed 19 people at a restaurant in Haifa and brought swift condemnation 
      from the Arab world. &quot;It can drag the whole region into a circle of 
      violence,&quot; warned Jordaian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher. Britain's 
      United Nations ambassador called Israel's actions &quot;unacceptable.&quot; 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Describing the attack as a &quot;grave 
      escalation&quot; of Mideast tensions, Syria turned to the United Nations 
      demanding -- and being granted -- an emergency meeting of the Security Council...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The chilling circle of events 
      seems eerily appropriate, given that the Yom Kippur war has been haunting 
      Israelis for decades...The Israeli attack happened a day before the 30th 
      anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. On October 6, 1973, on the holiest day 
      on the Jewish calendar, Egypt and Syria staged a surprise attack on Israel. 
      ome 2,700 Israeli soldiers were killed.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">This</font><i><font size="+1"> </font></i><font size="+1">morning 
    before the beginning of Yom Kippur services in front of the Jacob Javitz Center 
    in New York City, several police officers assigned to the day's observances 
    allowed me to stand outside the Center, and read privately from the Prayer 
    Book for the Day of Atonement (from which all of the above excerpts are taken). 
    But when I petitioned those entering the service not to fail to make an atonement 
    for all of the violence that was being committed by both <i>Israel</i> and 
    America in the Middle East (in the Name of God), and after several worshippers 
    were visibly agitated by the suggestion, an officer approached and told me 
    that he was not going to tolerate any problems, and that those entering the 
    services were entitled not to be assaulted with offensive ideas. &quot;I respect 
    your right of free speech,&quot; he said (as long as I do not exercise it 
    of course), &quot;but if you persist I will have no choice but to confiscate 
    your materials and books...If you want to be quiet you can stay, otherwise 
    you will be forced to leave.&quot; As I was leaving I mentioned to him the 
    text in Ezekiel that states, that if a person sees the Sword coming, and warns 
    not the people, that God will hold that person responsible (Ezekiel 33). &quot;The 
    responsibilty is now yours,&quot; I told him, &quot;seeing that you have used 
    your authority to keep me from fulfilling mine.&quot; He shrugged uncaringly 
    and motioned me to move on. The reason for bringing all of this up is to repent 
    myself for those words. The officer cannot be held responsible for things 
    he does not understand, and for being hardened by his own circumstances in 
    life, and by the orders of others. We on the other hand, are accounted as 
    <i>fools for Messiah's sake</i>.</font></p>
