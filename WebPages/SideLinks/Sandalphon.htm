<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;QUESTION: The great American 
    poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a poem about the angel Sandalphon, saying 
    in part: 'Have you read in the Talmud of old…Of Sandalphon, the Angel of Glory 
    Sandalphon, the Angel of Prayer?' Could you please discuss Sandalphon? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ANSWER: The following information 
    is taken from the Gemara, the Midrash, the Zohar, the Encyclopedia Judaica, 
    and the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sandalphon is the name of one of 
    the most exalted angels. Ezekiel 1:15 was interpreted in the Babylonian Talmud 
    (<i>Hagiga 13b</i>) as referring to an angel who Stood on the earth with his 
    Head reaching up to the living creatures (<i>the hayyot</i>). This 'wheel' 
    is called Sandalphon, who is said to stand so far above his colleague, apparently 
    Metatron, that a journey between them would take 500 years. His place is behind 
    the <i>Merkabah</i>, the heavenly chariot, and he fashions Crown for his Creator… 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sandalphon is also mentioned as 
    one of the highest angels in the story of Moses' ascension to heaven, and 
    in the Midrash <i>Konen</i> he is called a mediator or 'translator' between 
    Israel and G-d, obviously he transforms the words of prayer into Mystical 
    Crowns on G-d's Head.The etymology of the name is explained, probably correctly, 
    as <i>synadalphos</i> ('<i>confrere</i>' or 'colleague'), namely of Metatron… 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many kabbalists declared that Sandalphon 
    was an angelic transformation of the prophet Elijah, just as Metatron was 
    described in earlier sources as the transfiguration of Enoch. Since the word 
    sandal has the meaning 'shoe', Sandalphon was thought of as the 'Shoe' of 
    the <i>Shekinah</i>, that is to say the angel on which the Feet of the Shekinah 
    rested. Some kabbalists considered him the teacher of Moses. Later Kabbalah 
    ascribed to him a special sphere of mystical being which was essentially more 
    than a pure angelic host. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Peskita Rabbati </i>(ch.2) narrates 
    that when <i>Moshe Rabbenu</i> ascended to heaven to receive the Torah, he 
    was accompanied by the angel Hadarniel until they came to the fiery image 
    of Sandalphon. They stopped, for the angel feared to continue lest they would 
    be burned by the flames of Sandalphon. Moses began to tremble when he saw 
    the awesomeness of this angel. G-d then assured him he had nothing to fear. 
    (This account also appears in the Zohar, <i>Parashat BeShalach 58</i>). </font>The
