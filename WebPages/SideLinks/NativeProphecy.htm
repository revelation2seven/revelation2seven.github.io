<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A TIBETAN MESSAGE 
  SEND THROUGH HOPIS &amp; MAORIS TO CANADIAN ALEUTS</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Healing: An Alaskan Prophesy -- From an article entitled &quot;Let Goodness 
  Take Its Place&quot; by Larry Merculieff, Aleut </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&gt; Larry began his 
  speech in the Aleut language with the saying &quot;The afternoon tastes good.&quot; 
  He continued: You are the second group of people that have invited me to talk 
  on something that is very special. I have been asked to give you some messages 
  from the spiritual leaders of the Hopi and Maori people from New Zealand. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I went up to Canada 
  one and 1/2 years ago, I went there to be with the Stony Elders. They invited 
  me to go there. While I was there, they said the Hopi and Maori sent the messenger 
  to meet me. I do not know why me but they gave me some messages to bring back 
  here to Alaska. They must have known THINGS THAT I DO NOT KNOW OR CANNOT SEE 
  YET. And this is one of the things that I think they knew: that I was going 
  to be invited to speak in places like this. One thing to know before I start. 
  The people who are here today are here for a reason. It is no accident that 
  you are going to be here to hear this message and it is up to you whether or 
  not you want to use this message of wisdom that has been given by Hopi and Maori. 
  If you do not use it, I would ask you pass it along to others. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I used to write my 
  speeches. You know, when I left the University they train you to write everything 
  down. As Commissioner, you have to write everything down for the public record. 
  I stopped doing that when an old man, Howard Luke, and I were exchanging tape 
  recordings with each other. He sent me this tape and said, &quot;Anybody that 
  gets up in front of a crowd of people and has to read from a piece of paper 
  has no business being up there!&quot; So for the first time in my 43 years, 
  today I say &quot;OK, the papers are going to be put away.&quot; I will speak 
  from the heart. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a great deal 
  of wisdom in speaking from the heart instead from a paper. It was a relearning 
  for me. I learned it very well, I think. When I have to speak before a group, 
  I never know what I am going to say. The only thing I can do is clear my mind, 
  clear my body, and pray for the messages given from the people that I have been 
  sent here to give the messages for. And I pray to the Creator to help, When 
  I came here, I also prayed for the help of the Spirit of the land; The Spirits 
  of your ancestors; The Spirit of the river; The Spirit of the animals; The Spirit 
  of the trees; and The Spirit of the wind because each area of the world has 
  got their own guardian. Even this group now has it's own guardians. They are 
  here now they are sitting with us and so I ask for their help when I talk. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Hopi and Maori sent 
  a messenger, who's name was Beverly, to meet me when I was up in Canada. The 
  messages come from the Hopi and Maori and the Stony Elders who are part of the 
  great Sioux Nation in Alberta, also from the White Bison Society. I will explain 
  what this is. What the Hopi and Maori wanted us to know here in Alaska and all 
  the villages, is that we are moving into the what they call the World of THE 
  5TH HOOP. The Navajo called it moving into THE 5TH WORLD. Maybe amongst some 
  of the elders of the Athabascan people there are similar things that are being 
  said about this time. It is a message of hope. They know of the sicknesses that 
  made them suffer. They know of the fights that have been going on between the 
  organization and the villages. </font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/WheelofDharma.gif" width="308" height="298"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They know of the struggle 
  between villages and within regions and between regions. They know about the 
  alcohol abuse and accidental deaths due to alcohol, the suicides, the high blood 
  pressure, failing health, heart problems, all these things that our people in 
  Alaska have been facing. In my years working for my people, I have traveled 
  all over the State and it is pretty much the same everywhere, the kind of problems 
  we are experiencing. That is not what this message is about. They know about 
  our business in the villages. This message is a message of hope. THEY SAY THAT 
  MOVING INTO THIS TIME, OF THE WORLD OF THE 5TH HOOP, IS A TIME WHEN ALL FOUR 
  SACRED POWERS ARE GOING TO BE RECONNECTED. THEY ARE THE RED-WHITE-BLACK-YELLOW. 
  They wanted me to know that among the Hopi they are the keepers of the sacred 
  stone tablets for the sacred red power - that includes all of us. They wanted 
  me to know that THEY HAVE THE SACRED STONE TABLETS IN TIBET, IN THE MOUNTAINS, 
  KEPT BY TIBETAN MONKS. In the same way that the Tibetans have their sacred stone 
  tablet with the Hopi. <br>
  <br>
  THERE ARE FOUR SACRED STONE TABLETS THAT WERE GIVEN. The sacred black color 
  has theirs in a small village in Africa. THEY CANNOT EXCHANGE IT WITH THE SACRED 
  WHITE COLOR BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIRS. BUT THE HOPI WISDOM KEEPERS SAY THAT THEY 
  ARE SOON TO FIND THIS STONE. VERY SOON IN THIS TIME. If you look at the maps 
  where the people of Hopi live and Tibetans live is exactly on opposite parts 
  of the world of the Mother Earth. The Hopi word for love is the Tibetan word 
  for hate. And the Tibetan word for love is the Hopi word for hate. The same 
  word but exactly opposite meanings. They say that this is necessary TO KEEP 
  THE BALANCE OF MOTHER EARTH. AND THAT THERE ARE KEEPERS OF THIS BALANCE THAT 
  ARE AROUND THE WORLD LIKE US. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In moving into this 
  time of the World of the 5th Hoop IT IS GOING TO BE A TIME OF GREAT HEALING. 
  There is going to be great healing that is going to start and the Hopi say that 
  it is going to start in the North. I have learned just recently that it is going 
  to start in Alaska. The Hopi told me that this time of great healing is going 
  to be shown by several signs. ONE IS WHEN A HOOP OF A HUNDRED EAGLE FEATHERS 
  IS COMPLETED. And I have met the person from the White Bison Society in Colorado, 
  who are the keepers of this hoop. I met the person while I was in ANCHORAGE, 
  while we were having dinner, a lady came in from KODIAK and she had an eagle 
  feather in hand. She said, &quot;I know this had to go to some special place 
  and I guess it is you.&quot; and gave it to this guy who was sitting there. 
  His mouth dropped open. He could hardly speak. He said that this was the eagle 
  feather THAT WAS TO BE THE AXLE. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE CENTER POINT IN 
  THIS HOOP OF 100 EAGLES THAT WAS DESCRIBED TO HIM EXACTLY BY THE WISDOM KEEPERS. 
  The eagle feathers numbered 57 at that time. Since that time two more have come 
  from Alaska. One from an all white eagle. This white eagle had called to this 
  man. (This is true as I was a witness.) He was a white man. He calls me up and 
  he says, &quot;I do not know why I am calling, but this morning I looked up 
  in my yard and there were 13 RAVENS IN A CIRCLE and in the middle of the circle 
  was an eagle.&quot; He said he knew that was pretty weird. He had never seen 
  anything like it. The people in the village had never seen anything like this. 
  This was just about a month and a half ago. He said that he had heard the story 
  of the hoop of the 100 eagle feathers. He said that night the tribal chief delivered 
  to him the dead eagle. That morning he saw the eagle alive, surrounded by 13 
  ravens. That evening it was delivered to the camp. He did not know why. And 
  so he heard of the story and knew that if he asked permission properly one of 
  these eagle feathers was to be delivered to this hoop. And so it was. A person 
  who was on his way down to Colorado delivered the white eagle feather or the 
  feather from a white eagle. So now there were two feathers delivered. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In this time of healing 
  the message of hope from the Hopi &amp; Maori and the Stony Elders, I was invited 
  to Sacred Ceremony by the Stony Elders and the youngest was 77 and the oldest 
  was 106. No one spoke any English during the whole time I was in the Sacred 
  Ceremony, which lasted 3 hours. They spoke English one in the middle, and the 
  person who spoke said &quot;I am speaking English for the benefit of our friends 
  from Alaska.&quot; We know that your people in Alaska, in many villages, believe 
  that they have lost their culture, the cultural wisdom and their ways. We are 
  praying to the Creator. We want you to know of the message that has been given 
  to us so that you would take it back to Alaska. The message that they received 
  for us is that our cultures are not dead. ALL THE WISDOM THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED 
  IN OUR CULTURES, SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL, IS BEING KEPT FOR US. WAITING FOR US 
  TO AWAKEN IN OUR SPIRITS. We will awaken our spirits again, when that happens 
  THINGS WILL BE REVEALED of the old wisdom's. THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN 
  FOR A LONG TIME ARE GOING TO BE BROUGHT BACK; Art-Music-Song-Dance-Story- telling-Spiritual-Wisdom-knowledge 
  and the wisdom of how to work with Mother Earth will all be restored.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They also want us to 
  know that among the Hopi and Maori there are people who do nothing but pray 
  24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, every year of their lives. That 
  is all they do. In rotation, they pray around the clock for other people. In 
  this prayer is where they have seen some of these things that are bout to happen. 
  The healing that is going to take place, the advice that has been given to us 
  is &quot;Seek not to fight evil - do not fight it -- let goodness take it's 
  place.&quot; So when we see bad things happen and when we fight those bad things, 
  what we do hurts everybody. Fighting evil has spiritual energies that go to 
  the ends of universe, affects everybody in the community. When I come into community 
  I can feel the energies that are created. We are all affected by it. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know sometimes you 
  watch little kids when a stranger walks into the room all of a sudden the child 
  just cries, sometimes this happens or they love the stranger. What are they 
  doing is taking their God given, Creator given way of talents, skills, gifts 
  to feel the spirit of the other person. Because everybody give out these energies, 
  so we have to, they say, be very careful. This is part of the wisdom amongst 
  the great Athabascan People and most indigenous people throughout the world. 
  We must take care of how we think how we feel. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The signs of this time 
  of healing that is to start are: When the children bring back the spirit to 
  the village. When the young start speaking with the wisdom of the elders. WHEN 
  THE LEADERSHIP ENERGIES START SHIFTING TO THE FEMININE SIDE. WHEN THIS HOOP 
  OF 100 FEATHERS GETS COMPLETED. AND WHEN THE WHITE BISON SHOWS UP. These are 
  all the signs of the movement FROM THE 4TH TO THE 5TH HOOP. Now, I know that 
  some of this is in language that you may have not heard in your lifetime. But 
  I know inside, you will recognize these words to be true. Your intuition is 
  going to tell you what I am saying is true. The world for the last 4,000 or 
  so years has been stuck in the male energy side. The male energy is thinking 
  from the brain. It is a management from the top down. It is more aggressive. 
  It does not use intuition or feelings from the heart. It is a different kind 
  of energy. It is not a bad energy. It is just different than the female energy. 
  Female energy is healing, nurturing, loving, caring, touching, sharing and that 
  the world spiritual leaders know now that these energies have been male and 
  now have shifted to the female side. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The center of the top 
  of the energy entrance to the Earth Mother is here through Alaska. THE SPIRITUAL 
  LEADERS SAY THAT A HOST, HOSTS OF ANGELS ARE COMING THROUGH ALASKA -- spreading 
  out throughout the world for this healing to take place. I see what is happening 
  to our young people. I spend most of my life thinking I was a leader for 25 
  years working for my people. I realized, when I finally woke up, I was not a 
  leader because I was stuck in the same place with the same kind of sickness 
  they had. Harold Napoleon, who wrote the book, The Way of the Human Being, talks 
  about the great death. Why, people ask, are we suffering like this today? Why 
  are our kids this way? Why are we having this alcohol problem? It is easy to 
  understand when you get back in touch with your heart. Harold Napoleon talks 
  about the time of the great death. My people faced it. 80% of our people were 
  wiped out in 50 years. We still have stories of those times. How many men can 
  a musket ball kill? THE RUSSIANS were betting about the Aleuts, so they lined 
  them up back to back shot point blank and the answer is 9. There is one community 
  where the Russians went to take all the women and girls for their sex slaves. 
  The women and girls said &quot;No, this will be a violation of our spirit&quot; 
  and they all got on top of a cliff and jumped in mass and died. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a story in 
  a village in Akutan where it used to take a year to build meat boats from hide. 
  It was one of the most sophisticated kayaks in the world. It took a year to 
  build because it had to be dependable. They had to go out on the high seas for 
  weeks on end. They knew this and the Russians knew this. The fur traders who 
  were greedy, went into the village at night and destroyed all the boats. The 
  village starved to death. There was one old woman who survived out of 300 people. 
  So we have these stories. The first people who were killed among my people were 
  the Shaman and their apprentices, because of their religion or way of life of 
  spirituality, the Russians did not understand so they destroyed it. They thought 
  it was a threat. Can you imagine our people who are survivors, we are survivors 
  here today, having gone through that time, experiencing for 50 years, 8 our 
  of 10 people dying in a horrible way? Your loved ones? Your grandchildren?, 
  Your children?, Your mother?, Your wives?, Your husbands? dying by horrible 
  ways for 50 years? Year after year seeing horrible death? And being subjected 
  to all this, the American doctors have a name for this now, they call it Post 
  Traumatic Stress Syndrome.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Vietnam Vets have 
  also experienced this syndrome. The veterans, when they came back from Vietnam, 
  were depressed. They took drugs. They took alcohol. They withdrew from their 
  relationships. They could not be close to people because it hurt too much. They 
  did anything to escape their feeling and what they were thinking. When they 
  did that they separated from their spiritual side. When this happened the depression 
  started. So they experienced this for in Vietnam after 2 or 3 years. Sometimes 
  people had 4 trips over there. Our people experienced it for generations. Not 
  only did we not have the support that the Vietnam Vets had, they still had their 
  culture intact when they came back.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our cultures were eliminated 
  or attempted to be destroyed. So that the survivors who had survived were without 
  hope. Having gone through such misery and pain, the only thing they could do 
  to defend themselves the only way they knew how to defend themselves, was not 
  to feel. I know and I understand it. Harold Napoleon understood it. Many of 
  you understand it. Because as a child, like many of our people, I grew up in 
  a family the abused alcohol and the first thing that I did as a child to defend 
  myself was to shut off my feelings. They were shut off for over 20 years. And 
  when that happened which is a state of constant depression and addiction. Addictions 
  can be cigarettes - alcohol - TV - noise; big loud music, and even thoughts 
  could be an addiction. Anything to take us away from feeling right now the way 
  we feel, we try to run away from it. That is what happening when you see <br>
  a kid walk down the street with big earphones blasting and they are not hearing 
  anything else because they do not want to be here, no.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The wisdom keepers 
  say that the only place to find the power of the Creator is to be present in 
  this moment. If we have fears we are projecting them into the future. Into a 
  future time that does not even exist. If we have guilt, we are living in the 
  past, for the past things we did, we are not living now. All the spiritual keepers, 
  of all groups in the world, be they Buddhists, be they Islamic, be it part Red 
  Pack, be it medicine pack, you name it, say the only way to find the power that 
  has been given to us from the Creator is to be here, now. Not to escape. So 
  you see this addiction that has happened from the Great Death, the survivors 
  are separated from their feelings. Can you imagine the kind of children they 
  raised? It was hard for them to love and be close to another because they were 
  afraid if I became too close and love somebody they would be destroyed and I 
  would suffer the pain all over again. So, they stayed away from that feeling. 
  Those kids grew up and had their own kids and from generations to generation 
  to generation until today we have the legacy the inheritance of this spiritual 
  sickness that was given to us a long time ago. And so the answers from the wisdom 
  keepers is to work at being present and that will first revive the key. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The spiritual keepers 
  also say that the first step towards healing yourself before you can heal others 
  or help heal others is to love that which we may hate or who me may hate. We 
  may hate the ourselves. We may hate an organization. We may hate the people 
  from outside who have interfered. We may hate somebody. The first step towards 
  this healing is to stop the hate and turn it into love. And it will transform 
  everything. This spiritual sickness that we have is going to move now. It is 
  going to change. There are some predictions in the sacred stone tablets among 
  the wisdom keepers about what is going to happen here in this World of the 5th 
  Hoop. Not only are we going to have this healing but THE EARTH MOTHER IS GOING 
  TO SHAKE IN A WAY THAT SHE HAS NEVER SHOOK BEFORE. There is going to be a lot 
  of fear because of this and the wisdom keepers want me to convey that when this 
  happens, WE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID BECAUSE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT THE EARTH 
  MOTHER IS TRYING TO HELP US REMOVE THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE STUCK IN OUR BODIES, 
  inherited from the spiritual sickness of generations and generations out, and 
  one of the ways that we do that is to scare the life out of us. This is why 
  there is going to be time for healers. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Healers are being called 
  from all over. WOMEN ARE NOW TAKING THEIR PLACE AS THE ORIGINAL HEALERS AROUND 
  THE WORLD and some of the strongest original healers are starting here in Alaska. 
  Not only THE SHIFT TO THE FEMININE SIDE of leadership but the women are going 
  to start taking their place as healers. I think this is an exciting time. The 
  Dalai Lama went down to Yukatan during the last change of the moon with all 
  the spiritual leaders to pray for this time of the shift, this time of healing. 
  And he has chosen and this is the words that they use which are hard to understand. 
  He has chosen to take the spiritual energies that they have been keeping in 
  Tibet and move them from Tibet and bring them here to Alaska. Which they did 
  a few weeks ago. The reason they did this is because the Chinese are wiping 
  out the Tibetan Monks and destroying all the temples. So the Dalai Lama moved 
  its spiritual energy here to Alaska because this is the place where the healing 
  is going to start. AND THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE ALL THE ANGELS ARE COMING IN 
  BY HOSTS. This is the place where the hoop of a hundred eagle feathers will 
  be finished. And interestingly enough some of the healing ways are being revived 
  from all the cultures. People are being woken up. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How do we start this 
  healing? When you are quiet with in yourself and you sit next to the river - 
  ASK. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK. ASK THE CREATOR. Ask whoever you feel your higher 
  power, &quot;Please help me find the way because I do not know how to heal.&quot; 
  &quot;Make me your history.&quot; And when you ask that, with humility in your 
  heart, you will get it. You will find it. And it will be given to you, you will 
  see this healing starting to spread like wild fire. It is just exciting. Exciting 
  to see. And the key to it is staying here, now. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now last thing I am 
  going to say. I ran the village corporation in St. Paul for 10 years. I was 
  city manager for 4 years. We started from no economy out there. In 1983 the 
  government pulled out. That was our only economy. They pulled out and we lost 
  80% of our jobs. That year we had 100 suicide attempts out of 600 people. We 
  had 4 people who killed themselves. We had 3 who were murdered. Things that 
  had not happened in our village for 150 years. The last person ever murdered 
  in our village was over 150 years ago. And it all happened in this one year. 
  Big shaking up. And we thought, the leadership thought, including me, that if 
  we worked to bring the economy back so that everybody got a good paying job, 
  our kids would return to our village and that it would solve our problems. We 
  had growing alcohol problem, 60% of population alcoholic and 1/3 of our kids 
  have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. We had suicide attempts all the time. I have been 
  to 44 funerals here in 4 years. 44 funerals! Goodness sakes. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what we learned from 
  this and what I want to share with you is what happened when we got our economy. 
  We have the strongest rural economy in the State of Alaska right now. Our per 
  capita income is $34,000.00 per person. $34,000.00 per person. That is what 
  accomplished in 10 years. But did it solve our problems? NO. The spiritual sickness 
  is still going on. The money only feeds the addiction. If you have a community 
  that is already addicted in some way because of the spiritual sickness we have 
  inherited from the time of the great death. Bringing money in, in large numbers, 
  will fuel the addictions just like gasoline to fire. It will make it worse. 
  Bigger. Because what we do with the money if you look at St. Paul. We are buying 
  cars. Everybody has got a car now. Bought maybe 300 cars in last 3 years. Everybody 
  has got 1 or 2 TV sets - big ones. Everybody has got 4 wheelers. Everybody has 
  got boats. Everybody has got nice clothes. Everybody has got nice houses. THINGS. 
  Everybody has got things. But yet they are saying we are not happy. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is wrong? What 
  is wrong is we were looking outside for feeding for a hunger inside that we 
  did not understand. And that hunger is the hunger of the spirit. When we have 
  addictions, it is a hunger to fill the spirit. It is like a big stomach inside 
  you wants to feed all of the time. And no matter how much we feed it with these 
  addictions is never enough. And it just goes down and down and we get so depressed 
  that we feel we can not get out of it. Either at that point you die physically 
  or your die spiritually. Hopefully many people will not have to go through that. 
  So, that is the message that I have brought to you. This is a message of hope 
  and a message of good wisdom. Remember our cultures are not lost. The wisdom 
  of it is already here with us. We just do not know it yet, because we are spiritually 
  sleeping. </font></p>

  KALACHAKRA/TIBETAN PROPHECY</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Tibetan prophecy connected 
  with 2012. It is usually just a brief reference, but in Monument to the End 
  of Time, by Weidner and Bridges we get a bit more detail: &quot;The Tibetan 
  Kalachakra contains a prophecy that 860 years after its introduction into Tibet, 
  which happened in 1127, the conditions would be fulfilled for a twenty five 
  year period that would culminate in the appearance of THE TIBETAN VERSION OF 
  NEW JERUSALEM, THE HIDDEN CITY OF SHAMBALLA. Eight hundred sixty years after 
  1127 is 1987, and 25 years after that is 2012. These dates are also significant 
  in various versions of the Mayan calendar.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gautama Buddha (500 
  BC)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In approximately 500 
  BC Buddha (Gautama Buddha) 'turned the Wheel of Dharma'. He explained that the 
  wheel would turn every 500 years and there will be 5 turnings (2500 years = 
  ~2000 AD). Buddha said each revolution would result in a decline of the Dharma 
  (spiritual truth). He said the final turn would lead to a period of chaos and 
  strife leading to a new phase of consciousness of the planet and an unprecedented 
  change in man.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The text below was found on the net 
  supposedly taken from a French book which contained a translation of a manuscript 
  approx. 4000 years old, found in the Buddhist temple of Lhassa, in Tibet....&quot;When 
  the star of Baal dropped to the right where there is nothing more than sky and 
  sea, the seven cities trembled and worried with its gold towers and transparent 
  (glasses?) temples, as the leaves of trees do during a storm. A torrent of fire 
  fall over the palace. Cries from dying persons and moans in the crowd filled 
  the airs. The people went to find a hiding place in the temples and in the castles. 
  So the wise Mu, great priest of Ra-Mu stands up and says: Didn't I predict all 
  this to come?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Men and women, dressed with their 
  precious clothes, covered with precious stones, begged: - Mu, save us! Mu answers: 
  You will die, with your slaves and your treasures. From your ashes new peoples 
  will come. If these peoples forget they should dominate the material things 
  not only to progress, but also not to be diminished, the same fate will surprise 
  them. The flames and the fog choked the words of the wiseman. The country and 
  its inhabitants were smashed and swallowed in the abysms (of the oceans).&quot;</font></p>
