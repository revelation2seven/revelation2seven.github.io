  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;'Egypt 
    is the image of the skies,' writes Lucie Lamie, 'where the divine beings sail 
    'the waters on high,'' and so the Nile has a heavenly as well as earthly source…Its 
    periodic rise and fall are associated with the myth of Osiris, divine principle 
    of perpetual return, death and rebirth, as symbolized by the annual cycle 
    of vegetation… In Roman times the Nile was itself called 'the Year.' As one 
    scholar notes, 'This conception not only reflects the rather precise annual 
    recurrence of the flood, but also sought to relate it to the magical powers 
    of Time." Seeing that the Egyptians saw the Nile as "the exact counterpart 
    of heaven" and "the year incarnate,' it is only appropriate that the Nile, 
    spelled as it was in ancient Greek, totals 365, the number of days in the 
    year…&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE HOLY LAND OF EGYPT 
  AND ITS INITIATES</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Holy Land of those who had 
    gone out from the body, watered by the Celestial Nile, the River of Heaven, 
    of which the earthly river was a symbol and parallel, was divided into three 
    regions, or states:the Territory of Initiation; the Territory of Illumination; 
    and the Place of Union with the Unseen Father.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the religion of Egypt, 
    the deepest and most fascinating mystery of antiquity, the visible creation, 
    was conceived as the counterpart of the unseen world. And the substance consisted 
    not of a mere vague belief in the life beyond the grave, but in tracing out 
    the Path whereby the Just, when the portal of the tomb is lifted up, passes 
    through the successive stages of Initiation, of Illumination, and of Perfection, 
    necessary to fit that soul for an endless union with the Light, the Great 
    Creator.&quot; (1 Corinthians 2:6-16).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus we are told that at a certain 
    point in the Territory of Illumination, the Osirified, the purified soul, 
    has achieved the Passage of the Sun--that is to say, has passed beyond the 
    mortal mind-plane; he opens the Gates of the Celestial Nile and receives the 
    Crown of Illumination, &quot;fashioned after the form of the Zodiacal light, 
    the glory of the supreme heaven.&quot; ...The Guide and Conductor through 
    all these grades was Toth (Moses) the Eternal Wisdom. </font>Thrice-Greatest 
    Hermes, Studies in Hellenistic Theosophy and Gnosis, by G.R.S. Mead, pp.70,71<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">__________</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Dost thou speak of statues, 
    Thrice Majestic? Yes, of statues, Asclepios…of what else shall I speak but 
    of the statues, so full of life, of feeling, the prophetic statues which predict 
    the future by bestowing dreams and bt all manner of other ways…Are thou not 
    aware O Asclepios, THAT EGYPT IS THE IMAGE OF HEAVEN, OR RATHER THAT IT IS 
    THE PROJECTION BELOW OF THE ORDER OF THINGS ABOVE?If the truth must be known, 
    this land is indeed the Temple of the world. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, since sages ought 
    to forsee all things, there is one thing thou must know: a time will come 
    when it will seem that the Egyptians have adored the gods so piously in vain, 
    and that all their holy invocations have been barren and unheeded. Divinity 
    will quit the earth and return to heaven, forsaking Egypt, its ancient abode. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then this earth, hallowed by so 
    many shrines and temples, will be filled with sepulchres and with the dead. 
    O Egypt! There will remain of thy religion only vague legends which posterity 
    will refuse to believe…But yet sadder things will come to pass. Egypt will 
    fall into apostasy, the worst of all evils. Egypt, once the holy land beloved 
    of the gods and full of devotion will become an instrument of perversion, 
    the school of impiety, the type of all violence. Then filled with disgust 
    for everything, a man will no longer feel either admiration or love for the 
    world. He will turn away from the beautiful work, the most perfect alike in 
    the present, the past, and the future. Nor will the langour and weariness 
    of souls permit anything to remain save the disdain for the whole universe, 
    this immutable work of God, this glorious and perfect ediface, this manifold 
    synthesis of forms and images, wherein the will of the Lord has united all 
    things in a harmonious and single whole, worthy forever of veneration, of 
    praise and love. Then darkness will be preferred before light, and death will 
    be deemed better than life, nor will men lift up their eyes to heaven. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In those days religious men will 
    be thought mad; the impious men will be hailed as sages; savage men will be 
    deemed valient, and the evil-hearted will be applauded as the best of men… 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And thus God is above the summit 
    of heaven, yet everywhere present and beholding all things. For beyond the 
    heavens is a sphere without stars, transcending all corporate things…And to 
    those whom it will be given to dominate the earth shall be sent forth and 
    established AT THE EXTREMITY OF EGYPT, IN A CITY BUILT TOWARD THE WEST, whither 
    by sea and by land, shall flow all the race of mortals.&quot; The Hermetic 
    Works, The Virgin of the World, translated by Dr. Anna Kingsford, pp.71-75.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
