<p align="center"><font size="+2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This &quot;Suffering

<p align="center"><font size="+2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">to Your 
  Salvation</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">(The following tract was being handed out by two Hasidic 
    young men at Times Square on New Years Eve day, as they invited passers-by 
    to put on Tefilim in honour of the Sabbath which was to occur on the following 
    day, January 1, 2000. Both were members of the Lubavitcher movement, and disciples 
    of that school of thought that held the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem 
    Mendal Schneerson, to be the messiah, or <i>Moshiac</i>, himself):</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">You were created so 
      that you could recognize your Creator, love him, and serve him here on earth. 
      But do you know who G-d really is? The answer to this question surprises 
      many people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It is an easy mistake 
      to think that one is worshipping the one, true G-d, while actually serving 
      a false one. To help prevent this mistake, G-d described Himself in the 
      Bible, warning us to remember how He appeared when He gave the Ten Commandments:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><i><font size="+1">And the Eternal spoke to you from the middle of the 
        Fire, you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form, only a voice...</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">And guard your souls carefully, for you did not see 
        any form on the day the Eternal spoke to you in Horev from the middle 
        of the fire, lest you become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, 
        an image of any physical shape, the form of man and woman...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deut.4:12, 
        15-16).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In other words, G-d 
      has no physical shape. He is infinite and unlimited, and never appears in 
      the form of any human.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Nor does God have any 
      &quot;partners.&quot; He alone is the only One Who brings us eternal salvation, 
      as He says in the Bible:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><i><font size="+1">Am I not the Eternal? And there is no other god beside 
        Me--a just G-d and Savior; there is none else. Turn to me and be saved, 
        all the ends of the earth, for I am G-d and there is none else...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah 
        45:21-22).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Anyone who makes the 
      mistake of worshipping a man for spiritual salvation will be betrayed. (Psalm 
      146:3). Eternal life comes directly from G-d, Who is One and infinite, and 
      not through any mediator.</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">G-D's 
        FIRSTBORN SON</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">So how has G-d brought 
      his message of truth to the world? According to the Bible, G-d declares 
      that He does have a special son whose mission is to bring His blessings 
      and His salvation to the entire world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">WHO IS THIS SON? Many 
      religious leaders have offered their opinions on the identity of His son, 
      but really we should find out G-d's opinion on this matter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In the Book of Exodus, 
      G-d openly proclaims His son to the world: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="+1">&quot;Thus 
      says the L-rd:</font></font><font size="+1"><i> </i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
      firstborn son is</font><i> </i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ISRAEL</font><i>.&quot; 
      </i>(<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exodus 4:22). </font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&quot;Israel&quot; 
      is the Jewish people--ALL OF THEM. The Jews were chosen by G-d to be His 
      special &quot;son,&quot; to be, in the words of the Bible, &quot;a kingdom 
      of priests and a holy nation&quot; for the whole world. (Exodus 19:6).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">All people are G-d' 
      children, of course, but the Jews are like a &quot;firstborn son&quot; who 
      brings G-d's Word to his younger brothers. Every person who learns from 
      the Jews, and helps them fulfill their special role, becomes a part of G-d's 
      kingdom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Unfortunately, many 
      times people have not listened to the Jews. For many centuries, the Christian 
      church killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Jews--men, women, and children--to 
      prevent their holy message from reaching the rest of the world. Today, church 
      leaders still try to silence the Jewish message by sending missionaries 
      to convert Jews to Christianity!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Bible tells us 
      that the Jews would suffer greatly, not just for their own sins, but also 
      for the sake of bringing G-d's Word to a rebellious world:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><i><font size="+1">Comfort, comfort my people, says your G-d. Persuade 
        Jerusalem and call to her, FOR HER TIME IS FULL, for her sins have been 
        repaid; FOR SHE HAS RECEIVED FROM THE HAND OF THE LORD DOUBLE FOR ALL 
        HER SINS...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah 40:1-2).</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">SALVATION 
        THROUGH THE LAW</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Jewish people have 
      been taught the secret to eternal life and blessings for all people, and 
      now they finally have the freedom to reveal G-d's message.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">According to that message, 
      the key that unlocks the door to a personal relationship with G-d is His 
      Law--one part for the Jews, the other part for the rest of the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">At Mount Sinai, God 
      gave the Ten Commandments (and hundreds of others) to the Jewish people. 
      These laws apply only to the Jews in their special role as the world's spiritual 
      leaders.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">But for everyone else, 
      G-d gave the SEVEN Commandments (and dozens of other laws). These commandments 
      were given to Noah, after he left the ark that saved his family from the 
      great flood, as an eternal covenant with all the peoples of the earth. (Genesis 
      8:20--9:17). Since Mount Sinai, the Jews have carried the message of these 
      Seven laws to all the peoples.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">A non-Jew who follows 
      these commandments is called a Child of Noah, and he receives both eternal 
      life and G-d's blessings in his earthly life. By doing good works exactly 
      as G-d commands, he earns a close relationship with his Creator.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">A Child of Noah celebrates 
      certain &quot;Old Testament&quot; holidays, not Christian holidays. He prays 
      to God in the proper way, according to G-d's instructions. He also helps 
      the poor, and he guides his fellow humans--including non-religious Jews--back 
      to G-d's Law. A Child of Noah learns how to redeem every part of his life 
      from the emptiness of modern existence, becoming a &quot;soldier&quot; in 
      G-d's spiritual army.</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">THE 
        MESSIAH's MESSAGE TO THE WORLD</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">By asking the Jews 
      for spiritual guidance and turning back to &quot;Old Testament&quot; Law, 
      a Child of Noah also accomplishes the most important task of all: He helps 
      bring the Messiah to redeem the entire world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Messiah is a Jewish 
      king who will gather all the Jewish people to Israel, destroy all evil, 
      rebuild the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, and bring true freedom to the world 
      by returning everyone to the Law. He will institute G-d's eternal kingdom 
      here on earth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Messiah will teach 
      the Word of G-d to all nations, causing Christianity and all other religions 
      to disappear. The Bible says that everyone will become a Child of Noah, 
      thirsting for the ancient Truth:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><i><font size="+1">O L-rd, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge 
        in the day of distress, gentiles will come to You from the ends of the 
        earth and say, We have inherited only lies from our fathers, vanity and 
        things which are not useful. Can a man make gods for himself, and they 
        are not gods?</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this 
        time I will let them know My hand and My strength, and they will know 
        that My Name is Hashem...</font></i><font size="+1">(Jeremiah 16:19-21).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In our generation the 
      spiritual leader of the Jewish people--and therefore of the whole world--is 
      Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (known as the &quot;Lubavitcher Rebbe&quot;), 
      in New York. He is a righteous prophet who has never sinned, nor even been 
      tempted, in his entire life; indeed he has brought hundreds of thousands 
      of Jews and gentiles back to the Law. Moreover, he is a direct descendant 
      of King David.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">The Rebbe has revealed 
      that the Messiah will finally arrive now, in our generation, amidst great 
      miracles. He has also announced that every Jew, and every gentile, is a 
      representative of G-d to help bring the Messiah immediately.</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">AN 
        URGENT CALL TO ACTION</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">In the Book of Genesis, 
      G-d told Abraham that his descendants, the Jewish people, would bless the 
      world with the light of G-d's Word. Only by turning to the Jews can anyone 
      join G-d's holy kingdom:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><i><font size="+1">And I will bless those who bless you, but I will curse 
        those who curse you; and through you all the families of the earth will 
        be blessed...</font></i><font size="+1">(Genesis 12:3).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Regardless of your 
      race, religious background, or nationality, G-d is calling on you to help 
      the Jewish people bring the Messiah. You don't have to be Jewish to help; 
      in fact the Children of Noah can serve G-d in special ways that Jews cannot, 
      since G-d's Law is stricter for Jews.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">While being helped with the Tefilim, and rehearsed through 
    the prayer <i>Baruch Atah Adonai, Elohaynu Melech ha-olam... </i>I reminded 
    the two young men of the words: <i>For with stammering lips and another tongue 
    will he speak to this people, </i>(Isaiah 28:11), and said to them that it 
    was very possible that when the Messiah comes he will not even know how to 
    speak Hebrew. They looked at each other, and then at me, and said: &quot;Well 
    just so long as he comes.&quot;</font> </p>

  <p><font size="+1">King Messiah(s) shall indeed appear in our time from among 
    the Jews, on the Jewish or Female side of the Tree of Life, but not in accordance 
    with the limited, imperfect (Zionist) worldview of the Jewish people, or of 
    these young Lubavitchers who sadly lack a total understanding of the meaning 
    of the Christian epoch, and of the universal precepts of the Sacred Torah. 
    But in deference to Jewish understanding, also definetly not in accordance 
    with any of the literal interpretations (or non-interpretations) of the Christian 
    religion, which is just as sadly ignorant of the role of the Jews in this 
    age-ending drama, or the full import of Paul's words at Romans, chapter 11. 
    (KJV). It will be as Paul (Elisha) also said, expressing in his own written 
    texts the most sublime insights (or farsights) of the Christian revelation:

      as I would, and I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there 
      be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, 
      tumults.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">AND LEST, WHEN I COME AGAIN, my God will humble me among 
      you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not 
      repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they 
      have committed.</font></i></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Paul, speaking in the spirit of Hermes-Mercurius-the Thrice-majestic, 
      says: </font><i><font size="+1">This is the Third Time I am coming to you. 
      In the mouth of Two or Three witnesses shall every word be established...</font></i><font size="+1">(2
