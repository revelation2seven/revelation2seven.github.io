  <p><b>From East to West, The Transit of Venus, June 8, 2004.</b></p>
  <p align="left"> The planet Venus has completed a very rare passage across the 
    face of the Sun - an event not witnessed since 1882. The so-called transit 
    of Venus began at about 0620 BST (0520 GMT) with the planet's tiny black disc 
    edging over the bright limb of our star. The phenomenon continued for about 
    six hours, ending around 1224 BST. </p>
  <p align="left">People across the world gathered to watch the event; from the 
    UK to Lebanon, from Japan to Australia. In Britain, many people gathered at 
    the Royal Observatory in Greenwich to see the event. &quot;It's been outstanding,&quot; 
    said space scientist Professor Colin Pillinger, who was at the event. &quot;You 
    couldn't have wished for a better six hours of sunshine. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Look around here and you can see that people are spellbound. 
    It's great to see planetary science so popular.&quot; Dr Jim O'Donnell, of 
    the Royal Observatory, said the day had been &quot;a very exciting occasion&quot;.&quot;It's 
    one thing to see events like this in pictures or on TV but quite another to 
    look through a telescope and view it with your own eyes.&quot; </p>
  <p align="left">Venus transits occur approximately four times in 243 years, 
    more precisely in pairs of events separated by about eight years and these 
    pairs are separated by about 105 or 121 years. The reason for these long intervals 
    lies in the fact that the orbits of Venus and the Earth do not lie in the 
    same plane and a transit can only occur if both planets and the Sun are situated 
    exactly on one line. </p>
  <p align="left">This has happened only six times in the telescopic age: in 1631, 
    1639, 1761, 1769, 1874 and 1882. THE NEXT TRANSIT WILL NOW BE IN 2012, and 
    the one after that will be in 2117. </p>
  <p align="left">The transits have had huge significance in the past, as they 
    were used by scientists to work out the Sun-Earth distance - and hence to 
    get a proper scale for the Solar System.Today their value is more in their 
    uniqueness. &quot;It's an extremely rare astronomical event,&quot; said Gordon 
    Bromage, a professor of astronomy at UCLAN. </p>
  <p align="left"> The planet itself is soon to come under close scrutiny from 
    Europe's Venus Express probe. The spacecraft, due to be launched next year, 
    will study the planet's thick atmosphere and look for any volcanic activity 
    that might still persist today.</p>

<div align="left">Venus, the jewel of the sky, was once know by ancient astronomers 
  as THE MORNING AND EVENING STAR. Early astronomers once thought Venus to be 
  two separate bodies. Venus, which is named after the Roman goddess of love AND 
  BEAUTY, is veiled by thick swirling cloud cover. </div>

</div>
<div align="left">Venus (Greek: Aphrodite; Babylonian: Ishtar) is the goddess 
  of love and beauty. The planet is so named probably because it is the brightest 
  of the planets known to the ancients. (With a few exceptions, the surface features 
  on Venus are named for female figures.) Venus has been known since prehistoric 
  times. It is the brightest object in the sky except for the Sun and the Moon. 
  Like Mercury, it was popularly thought to be two separate bodies: Eosphorus 
  as the morning star AND HESPERUS AS THE EVENING STAR.</div>

  date the Vinalia Rustica was observed. A second festival, that of the Veneralia, 
  was celebrated on April 1 in honor of Venus Verticordia, who later became the 
  protector against vice. Her temple was built in 114 BCE. After the Roman defeat 
  near Lake Trasum in 215 BCE, a temple was built on the Capitol for Venus Erycina. 
  This temple was officially opened on April 23, and a festival, the Vinalia Priora, 
  was instituted to celebrate the occasion. </p>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(July and August)</font> named her 
  the ancestor of their (Julian) family: the 'gens Julia' was Aeneas, son of Venus 
  and the mortal Anchises. Ceasar introduced the cult of Venus Genetrix, THE GODESS 
  OF MOTHERHOOD and marriage, and built a temple for her in 46 BCE. She was also 
  honored in the temple of Mars Ultor. The last great temple of Venus was built 
  by the emperor Hadrianus near the Colusseum in 135 CE. </p>

<p align="center"><b>The Birth of Venus</b></p>
<p> Sandro Filipepi, called il Botticelli, 1485 circa. The picture was probably 
  realized on behalf of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici or otherwise commissioned 
  to be presented to him. In his villa at Castello, near Florence, the painting 
  is documented at the half of the 16th century, as well as two other masterworks 
  by Botticelli, the Primavera and Pallas and the Centaur (both at the Uffizi). 
  The scene represents VENUS, BORN OF THE SEA, BEING SPED BY ZEPHIR TOWARDS LAND, 
  WHERE AN HOUR IS READY TO COVER HER WITH A BEAUTIFUL CLOAK. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Understand 
  Isaiah 52)</font>. This mythological subject was very important in Renaissance 
  literature and philosopy, so the scene can hint different allegorical means. 
  The canvas, dating around 1485, certainly reflects the presence of Botticelli 
  among the Florentine humanistic circle and his study on classical sculpture, 
  since this celebrated Venus recalls many ancient statues of the goddess.</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p>Among the Florentine artists of the second half of the fifteenth century who 
  strove for a solution to this question was the painter Sandro Botticelli (1446-1510). 
  One of his most famous pictures represents not a Christian legend but a classical 
  myth <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(On the contrary, Venus is a 
  Greek and Latin perception of the hidden mysteries of Jerusalem--the City Above, 
  the Mother of Us All...Galatians 4:19-31...KJV)</font>. </p>
<p>The classical poets had been known all through the Middle Ages, but only at 
  the time of the Renaissance, when the Italians tried so passionately to recapture 
  the former glory of Rome, did the classical myths become popular among educated 
  laymen. To these men, the mythology of the admired Greeks and Romans represented 
  something more than gay and pretty fairy-tales. THEY WERE SO CONVINCED OF THE 
  SUPERIOR WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THEY BELIEVED THESE CLASSICAL LEGENDS MUST 
  CONTAIN SOME PROFOUND AND MYSTERIOUS TRUTH. The patron who commissioned the 
  Botticelli painting for his country villa was a member of the rich and powerful 
  family of the Medici. Either he himself, or one of his learned friends, probably 
  explained to the painter what was known of the way the ancients had represented 
  VENUS <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(BEAUTY)</font> RISING FROM 
  THE SEA. TO THESE SCHOLARS THE STORY OF HER BIRTH WAS THE SYMBOL OF MYSTERY 
  THROUGH WHICH THE DIVINE MESSAGE OF BEAUTY CAME INTO THE WORLD. One can imagine 
  that the painter set to work reverently to represent this myth in a worthy manner. 
  The action of the picture is quickly understood. Venus has emerged from the 
  sea on a shell which is driven to the shore by flying wind-gods amidst a shower 
  of roses. As she is about to step on to the land, one of the Hours or Nymphs 
  receives her with a purple cloak. Botticelli has succeeded where Pollaiuolo 
  failed. His picture forms, in fact, a perfectly harmonious pattern. But Pollaiuolo 
  might have said that Botticelli had done so by sacrificing some of the achievements 
  he had tried so hard to preserve. Botticelli's figures look less solid. They 
  are not so correctly drawn as Pollaiuolo or Masaccio's. The graceful movements 
  and melodious lines of his composition recall the Gothic tradition of Ghiberti 
  and Fra Angelico, perhaps even the art of the fourteenth century - works such 
  as Simone Martini's Annunciation. </p>
<p>Botticelli's Venus is so beautiful that we do not notice the unnatural length 
  of her neck, the steep fall of her shoulders and the queer way her left arm 
  is hinged to the body. Or, rather, we should say that these liberties which 
  Botticelli took with nature in order to achieve a graceful outline add to the 
  beauty and harmony of the design because they enhance the impression of an infinitely 
  tender and delicate being, WAFTED TO OUR SHORES AS A GIFT FROM HEAVEN. </p>

<p>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Early in the evening of June 17, 2 B.C., the brightest 
  planets in the sky, Jupiter and Venus, merged into a dazzling &quot;star&quot; 
  near the western horizon, according to calculations of modern astronomers. In 
  countries to the east of what was then the kingdom of Judea, observers could

<p>Astrologers associated Jupiter with the birth of kings and Venus with fertility. 
  The meeting of Jupiter and Venus took place in the constellation Leo the Lion, 
  which the Old Testament of the Bible specifically associated with the Jewish 
  people. And it happened near the brightest star in Leo, Regulus, most closely 
  identified with kingship. There has not been a brighter, closer conjunction 
  of Venus and Jupiter in Leo so near to Regulus in the 2,000 years before or 
  since. Could this be the event that caused a group of astrologers called the 
  Wise Men to travel to Jerusalem in search of a new king almost 2,000 years ago? 
</p>
<p>The Star of Bethlehem is mentioned only in a few verses of the New Testament's 
  Book of Matthew (Chapter 2: 1-12), but it is one of the best-known parts of 
  the Christmas story. A number of astronomers and historians have tried to determine 
  what the unusual sight could have been. Still there is no consensus. Explanations 
  have been proposed since a suggestion by astronomer Johannes Kepler in the 17th 
  century, but each contribution has seemed to raise as many problems as it solves. 
</p>
<p>Hollis Johnson, professor emeritus of astronomy at Indiana University, has 
  collected a number of journal articles and other materials on the subject. &quot;The 
  question of the star is divided into two parts,&quot; Johnson noted. &quot;One 
  is astronomical: if a star was reported at the time, what was it? The other 
  is astrological: why did the Wise Men associate the star with the birth of Jesus?&quot; 
</p>
<p>There are three main theories to explain the Star of Bethlehem, Johnson said. 
  One is a close approach by Jupiter and Saturn three times during a period of 
  one year in 7-6 B.C. These conjunctions were not spectacular, Johnson said, 
  but a triple conjunction is rare and was therefore significant to astrologers. 
  A conjunction is a close approach between two celestial objects as seen from 
  Earth. The closer the objects come to each other, the more visually impressive 
  and astrologically significant the event is. This explanation is currently the 
  most popular, because it makes the common assumption that King Herod the Great 
  died in 4 B.C. </p>
<p>The second theory is the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus in 2 B.C. described 
  earlier. For this explanation to be true, Herod must have died at a later date 
  than is commonly believed. </p>
<p>The third theory involves something different -- a nova in the constellation 
  Aquila the Eagle, recorded by the Chinese in 5 B.C. A nova is an enormous explosion 
  at the surface of a star that is similar to a hydrogen bomb explosion, but much 
  more powerful. The star temporarily brightens greatly, which we see as a nova. 
  After a few days the star begins to fade, and after several months it is back 
  to its original brightness (which may be quite faint). &quot;We don't know how 
  bright the nova was, but it appeared to the ancients to be a new star,&quot; 
  Johnson pointed out. If the nova were not bright, it would have been noticed 
  only by those who studied the sky, such as astrologers. But it would have been 
  significant to astrologers because it was new. </p>
<p>Apparently the Star of Bethlehem was noticed only by the Wise Men. There is 
  no mention of a star in Luke's description of an angel announcing the birth 
  of Jesus to shepherds in a field. According to Matthew, when the Wise Men arrived 
  in Jerusalem they asked Herod, &quot;Where is he who is born King of the Jews? 
  For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him.&quot; Herod 
  had no idea what they were talking about and had to summon his advisers. The 
  advisers told the Wise Men that according to prophecy, the Messiah would be 
  born in Bethlehem. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The House of Bread)</font>...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg29a.gif" width="400" height="427"></p>
<p>If the birth of Jesus had been marked by a spectacular event such as a comet, 
  which was considered an omen of great significance, Herod at least would have 
  understood the Wise Men's reference to a star, and the shepherds would have 
  been expecting something extraordinary to happen instead of being surprised. 
  The astronomical event that excited the Wise Men seems to have been significant 
  only to them. This rules out the possibility of a conspicuous comet, which otherwise 
  would be a good candidate. It implies that the Wise Men were astrologers (among 
  other things), for such men would have known how to interpret the appearance 
  of a celestial object that did not attract more than the casual attention of 
  ordinary people. </p>
<p>To provide an astronomical explanation of the Star of Bethlehem, however, it 
  is necessary to know precisely when the Wise Men made their journey to Judea. 
  That turns out to be difficult to determine. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/IuDeA.gif" width="600" height="446"></p>
<p>The most crucial fact is that Herod was king when the Wise Men arrived in Jerusalem. 
  The difficulty is caused by disagreement among scholars about when Herod died. 
  Roman record-keepers were normally scrupulous, but no specific record of Herod's 
  death has been found. There is considerable indirect evidence that Herod died 
  in 1 B.C. or 1 A.D., but the commonly quoted date for his death is 4 B.C. Scholars 
  writing in the first and second centuries A.D. declared that Jesus was born 
  between what we now call 4 B.C. and 1 B.C. They were living much closer to the 
  event and had access to thousands of historical records. </p>
<p>In September of 3 B.C., Jupiter came into conjunction with Regulus, the star 
  of kingship, the brightest star in the constellation Leo the Lion. LEO WAS THE 
  CONSTELLATION OF KINGS, AND IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LION OF JUDAH. Just a 
  month earlier, Jupiter and Venus had almost seemed to touch each other in another 
  close conjunction, also in Leo. Then the conjunction between Jupiter and Regulus 
  was repeated in February and May of 2 B.C. Finally, on June 17, 2 B.C., Jupiter 
  and Venus, the two brightest objects in the night sky except for the moon, came 
  so close that their disks appeared to touch. This exceptionally rare event could 
  not have been missed by observers such as the Wise Men. </p>
<p>The Bible does not mention how many Wise Men there were or where they came 
  from. (The tradition of three Wise Men developed from the Bible's description 
  of three gifts -- gold, frankincense and myrrh.) It is reasonable to suppose 
  that their journey took months, however, since they had to cross several hundred 
  miles of desert to reach Jerusalem. If they were in Jerusalem before dawn on 
  Dec. 25, 2 B.C., they would in fact have seen Jupiter almost directly over Bethlehem 
  to the south. They could have traveled the five miles to Bethlehem and presented 
  their gifts that day. By then Jesus would have been a child living with his 
  parents in a house, not a baby in a manger. There is a reference not to an infant 
  (brephos in the Greek) but to a toddler (paidion), indicating that the birth 
  itself had been some months before. This would mean Jesus was born in the spring 
  or summer, which makes a better setting for Luke's account of the shepherds. 
  In December in Judea it was too cold for sheep to graze in the open fields, 
  and they were kept under shelter during the winter months, especially at night. 
</p>
<p>There is no conflict with the traditional date of Jesus' birth, because Dec. 
  25 was an arbitrary choice. Early Christians changed the date numerous times 
  to avoid discovery by the Romans when persecution of Christianity was at its 
  height. When Christianity finally became the official religion of the Roman 
  Empire, the festival of Christmas on Dec. 25 observing the birth of Jesus replaced 
  the pagan festival of Saturnalia at that time, WHICH HAD CELEBRATED THE &quot;REBIRTH 
  OF THE SUN&quot; AS THE DAYS GOT LONGER FOLLOWING THE WINTER SOLSTICE...</p>

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Malachi, chapter 4...KJV</b> </p>
<p>Designating Jupiter or the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus as the Star of 
  Bethlehem eliminates a number of problems, but probably neither is the last 
  word on the subject. So little is known historically about the period when Jesus 
  was born that new information may well provide a more accurate picture of what 
  happened. </p>

<p align="center">VENUS/ JUPITER/ DAYSTAR THEORY</p>
<p align="center">By Rev. Phil Greetham. </p>
<p>In this theory the Magi would have seen a conjunction between Jupiter and Venus 
  on the 12th August 3 BC. They would have marvelled at it but where unable, or 
  were disinterested, to find its meaning. A closer, second conjunction 10 months 
  later on the 17th June 2 BC got them thinking that this was important, and it 
  was then that they discovered the Jewish prophetic link with the coming of the 
  Messiah. To my knowledge there was no astrological interpretation to this phenomenon 
  but if the Magi were familiar with Jewish prophecy they might have linked it 
  to the Jewish prophecy CONCERNING THE RISING OF THE MORNING STAR as a precursor 
  to the coming of the Messiah. It is possible that the star would have been visible 
  even after the sun had risen. In other words the morning star would continue 
  to rise. THE PERSISTENT RISING OF THE MORNING STAR, RATHER THAN FADING FROM 
  SIGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AS A FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHECY AND SET THEM ON 
  THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM. They then journeyed to Jerusalem and after being sent 
  to Bethlehem they saw a third but much looser conjunction over Bethlehem on 
  the 21st August 1 BC. <br>
  <br>
  Jupiter and Venus coming so close that they appear to merge as one bright star 
  as they did on the morning of the 17th June 2 BC is a very rare event. It means 
  the two planets must get nearer to each other than 3 arc seconds. On average 
  it does this about once every 40 years at a particular site. However in order 
  for it to be visible it must happen after the sun has set and while the planets 
  themselves are above the horizon; that is during dusk or dawn. This makes viewing 
  this phenomenon very rare indeed. For example there were only 3 such possible 
  events in the period 800 BC - 1 BC. (719 BC, 618 BC and of course 2 BC). </p>
<p align="center">MAYAN PROPHECIES AND CALENDAR</p>
<p>THE MAYA KEPT TIME WITH A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL CYCLES THAT MESHED TOGETHER 
  TO MARK THE MOVENT OF THE SUN, MOON AND VENUS. Their ritual calendar, known 
  as the Tzolkin, was composed of 260 days. It pairs the numbers from 1 through 
  13 with a sequence of the 20 day-names shown below. It works something like 
  our days of the week pairing with the numbers of the month. Thus you might have 
  1-Imix (similar to Sunday the 1st) followed by 2-Ik (just as you would have 
  Monday the 2nd). When you get to 13-Ben, the next day would start the numbers 
  over again, thus 1-Ix, 2-Men etc. It will take 260 days before the cycle gets 
  back to 1-Imix again (13 x 20). </p>
<p>The 20 day-names are identified with their Yucatec names, pronunciation and 
  approximate translation. The name, meaning and symbol can vary in different 
  Maya languages. Also, each day can be represented with more elaborate glyphs 
  known as &quot;Head Variants&quot; - a formal writing system which can be loosely

<p>The Classic Mayan civilization was unique and left us a way to incorporate 
  higher dimensional knowledge of time and creation by leaving us the Tzolkin 
  calendar. The Mayans invented the calendars we use today. THE PRESENT CALENDAR 
  ENDS IN THE YEAR 2012. </p>
<p>BY TRACKING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MOON, VENUS, AND OTHER HEAVENLY BODIES, THE 
  MAYANS REALIZED THAT THERE WERE CYCLES IN THE COSMOS. From this came their reckoning 
  of time, and a calendar that accurately measures the solar year to within minutes. 
  The &quot;Calendar Round&quot; is like two gears that inter-mesh, one smaller 
  than the other. One of the 'gears' is called the tzolkin, or Sacred Round. The 
  other is the haab, or Calendar Round.</p>

  and 20 katuns were a &quot;baktun&quot;, 13 of which take us back to the August 
  13, 3114 B.C. date. Another notable date is 9-9-2-4-8 or July 29, 615 AD when 
  the great King of Palenque, Lord Pakal ascended to the throne. </p>
<p>These dates are carved in stone throughout the Mayan territory, and the numbers 
  can be seen by anyone. Using a vestigial system (they counted all the fingers 
  and toes) and only three characters (we use ten) the Maya could string together 
  very large numbers, these were read from the bottom up. So Pakal ascended on 
  9-9-2-4-8, that would read: 9 baktuns - 3600 years 9 katuns - 180 years 2 tuns 
  - 730 days 4 uinals - 80 days 8 kin - 8 days These numbers, if we begin at August 
  13, 3114 BC, will give us a date in the 7th century that corresponds to the 
  date Pakal took the throne in Palenque. The Maya also understood the concept 
  of zero, and wrote it like a shell. </p>
<p>With the new century almost upon us time takes on more meaning. January 1, 
  2000 would be written 12-19-6-1-0 in the Long Count. The Sacred Round would 
  be 9 Ahau and the Haab designation would be 8 Kankin. Thus the Calendar Round 
  would be 9 Ahau 8 Kankin. </p>
<p>So for the Maya there was a time for everything and every thing had it's place 
  in time. The priest used this to their advantage; due to their abilities to 
  interpret the heavens and calendar, they could control the daily activities 
  of the populace. Knowing when to plant, when to harvest, the rainy and dry seasons, 
  etc. gave them total power and control. Their comprehension of time, seasons, 
  and cycles was immense. If the reader is interested in further studies in this 
  (admittedly, complex!) area, I recommend Linda Shele's fine books, A Forest 
  of Kings and The Blood of Kings. </p>
<p>The Wheels of Time ground exceeding fine for the Maya. To be able to predict 
  the seasons for farmers and astronomical events for religious rites, they utilized 
  a calendar of two meshing, repeating cycles. Maya mathematicians could project 
  this calendar millions of years in the past and the future, time had no beginning, 
  no end. The Mayas recorded numbers with a system of bars and dots. a dot equals 
  one, a bar stands for five. The smaller wheels together represent the 260-day 
  Sacred Round; the inner wheel, with the numbers one to thirteen, meshes with 
  the glyphs for the 20 day names on the outer wheel. A section of a large wheel 
  represents part of the 365-day year - 18 months of 20 days each (numbered 0-19). 
  THE FIVE DAYS REMAINING AT YEAR'S END <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(symbolising 
  the end of the age)</font> WERE CONSIDERED EVIL. In the diagram, the day shown 
  is read 4 Ahua 8 Cumka. As the wheels turn in the direction of the arrows, in 
  four days it will read 8 Kan 12 Cumku. Any day calculated on these cycles would 
  not repeat for 18,980 days - 52 years. </p>

<p>A steadily quickening flow of earth changes has become so apparent in 1995 
  that even traditional media are paying attention. Earth transformation was the 
  cause of celebration of the Harmonic Convergence initiated by Jose &amp; Lloydine 
  Arguelles in August, 1987, and the Time Shift on July 26, 1992. The Time Shift 
  marked the time in history when the planet entered a new sequencing of energy 
  that after a magnetic pole shift in 2000, will be complete in December, 2012. 
  With the energy sequencing complete in 2012, Timeship Earth will launch her 
  voyage into fourth dimensional time in 2013. </p>
<p>The map of planetary transformation into a new dimensional time stream was 
  plotted in the Mayan calendar and interpreted by Jose &amp; Lloydine in the 
  Dreamspell. In the 1950s, Euro-American astronomers ran headlong into the stunning 
  reality that Native Americans were masters of a sophisticated astronomy previously 
  unrecognized. Since the New World was conquered, the Europeans had believed 
  that Native Americans were ignorant of astronomy. In fact, the Native American 
  concept was completely different than the European and thus not recognized. 
  Where European astronomers tracked large objects, such as the sun and moon, 
  in direct courses, the Native Americans tracked small objects relative to large 
  objects, a far more complex and accurate system. The two systems perceived the 
  heavens from such radically different view points, that the Europeans did not 
  recognize the Native American system as astronomy. </p>

<p>THE MAYAN CALENDAR </p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ancient Maya, and the remains of their cosmic culture, are still enshrouded 
  in mystery and confusion. To this day, much of what archeologists base their 
  findings upon is founded on guesses, not facts. Theories and speculations fill 
  the history books. It looks like we may never understand what the Maya are saying 
  to us. Like a giant cosmic joke, the riddles and puzzles left behind by the 
  Maya are still as much of a mystery today, as they were when they were first 
  discovered by the Spanish. </p>
<p>Maybe understanding the Tzolk'in with only the mental body was not the approach 
  the Mayas themselves intended. As we can see, the archeologists are still guessing, 
  with decades of research behind them. If the Maya intended us to understand 
  their knowledge of the universe, they would have to leave remains behind that 
  would bridge all cultures, languages, and all levels of education. This is what 
  the Maya have done. Without a doubt I can tell you the knowledge of the cosmos 
  is available to all. It is available to those who can open their hearts to the 
  wonder and curiosity of the universe once again. The encoding of the calendar 
  is intuitive and is remembered with feelings. It is also very mental and can 
  be learned with study. As daykeeper, Hunbatz Men has told me, we need to use 
  all our bodies to remember everything. The physical, mental, emotional and spiritual 
  bodies are needed. Without desire, wonder and curiosity there is no intention 
  to remember. Without study there is no understanding. To reconnect to the cosmos 
  and receive information from the Sun, as the Maya do, one must not only place 
  intention by physical study, but desire to remember! As we move our physical 
  bodies into action to study, the intuitive side will just kick in, but desire 
  is most important and quite essential. That's it! This is what the Maya intended. 
</p>
<p>The calendar with it's twenty Sun/glyphs are cosmic memory activation tools 
  that intuitively interacts with your body's memory, your DNA. The calendar is 
  not only an incredibly accurate map of the cycles of the cosmos, but is also 
  a tool to accelerate and activate your memory into recalling the truth behind 
  the mystery of the cosmos. Each glyph is charged with precise information in 
  the form of feelings or emotions to help active you in a very personal and individual 
  way. Each person will remember their own personal perspective of the truth based 
  on their place in the calendar system. This is not something you need to learn, 
  it is something you will remember. </p>
<p>So here we are, all of us just itching to remember. We have a haunting feeling 
  of something forgotten looming just out of reach, lying just beyond the veil 
  of our own created, limiting reality. I am asking you to have to courage to 
  plow thought this barrier of limitation and remember the totality of who you 
  are, to live in your own personal integrity. </p>
<p>You will need to commit to this for a while. Memory activation does not create 
  instant results. Activation takes place in stages and layers. At first you will 
  find the sacred calendar quite mental. If you find yourself mentally fuzzing 
  out when you begin to place your attention on these teachings, understand that 
  this is a common problem. You are just coming face to face with your own personal 
  limitation program. You are hitting a time/space dimensional barrier and your 
  body is saying &ocirc;I can't do this, I can't remember everything. I can't 
  be limitless.&quot; I say you can, and you will. It is you destiny to do so. 
</p>
<p>This is a new year challenge. Commit yourself to remembering the totality of 
  who you are by following these calendars for one earth cycle, just a short 365 
  days. Place your intention for just a few minutes every day on the Mayan day 
  instead of the linear Gregorian day. Get your body cycling with the cosmos again, 
  instead of the ticking clock. Move into the undulating, spiraling, ascending 
  energy of the cosmos. Watch the sun rise and set. Watch the moon rise and set. 
  Soon you will begin to dream with more detail. You will feel more deeply. Understand 
  more clearly. You will feel a part of a much bigger whole. You will remember 
  little pieces of information. They will just pop into you head. If this sounds 
  good to you, lets get started. </p>

<p><br>
  The Basics of the Mayan Calendar</p>
<p>The Maya understood 17 different Calendars based on the Cosmos. Some of these 
  calendars go back as far as ten million years and are so difficult that you 
  would need an astronomer, astrologer, geologist, and a mathematician just to 
  work out the calculations. Lucky for us we only need to work with three of these 
  calendars. The calendars that are most important to beings of earth are the 
  Haab, the Tun-Uc and the Tzolk'in. The Tzolk'in is the most important and the 
  one with the most influence. </p>
<p>The Haab is based in the cycles of earth. It has 360 + 5 days, totaling 365 
  days. The Haab uses 18 months with 20 days in each month. There is a 19th month 
  called a Vayeb and uses the 5 extra days. Each month has it's own name/glyph. 
  Each day uses a sacred sun/glyph. </p>
<p>The Tun-Uc is the moon calendar. It uses 28 day cycles that mirrors the women's 
  moon cycle. This cycle of the moon is broken down into 4 smaller cycles, of 
  7 day each. These smaller cycles are the four phases of moon cycle. Portal days 
  (p), on the calendar provided marks days using mathematics of 28 and their fore 
  have a connection with the moon cycles. </p>
<p>The Tzolk'in is the Sacred calendar of the Maya and is based on the cycles 
  of the Pleiadies. The cycle of the Pleiadies uses 26,000 years, but is reflected 
  in the calendar we are using by encompassing 260 days. It uses the sacred numbers 
  13 and 20. The 13 represents the numbers and 20 represents the sun/glyphs. The 
  Tzolk'in has four smaller cycles called seasons of 65 days each guarded by the 
  four suns of Chicchan, Oc, Men and Ahau. There are also Portal days within the 
  Tzolkin that create a double helix pattern using 52 days and the mathematics 
  of 28. This sacred calendar is still being used for divination by the traditional 
  Maya all over the Yucatan, Guatemala, and Belize, and Honduras. </p>
<p>The Tzolkin calendar was meshed with a 365-day solar cycle called the &quot;Haab&quot;. 
  The calendar consisted of 18 months with 20 days (numbered 0-19) and a short 
  &quot;month&quot; of only 5 days that was called the Wayeb and was considered 
  to be a dangerous time. It took 52 years for the Tzolkin and Haab calendars 
  to move through a complete cycle. </p>
<p>These are the Mayan words for periods of time: Day = Kin (keen)<br>
  Month of 20 days = Uinal (wee nal)<br>
  Year of 360 days = Tun (toon)<br>
  20 Tuns = K'atun (k' ah toon)<br>
  20 K'atuns = Baktun (bock toon)</p>
<p>During their stay on Earth the Cosmic Maya carried the burden of time. Cosmicly 
  aware of the cycles of time, they were bound, as we are, by walking through 
  time in a linear fashion. They were aware that beings of Earth had lost the 
  natural ability to ride the cycles of time/light/energy, to time travel. It 
  is also known by the Cosmic Maya that this present linear fashion of time will 
  transform into multidimensionality, and will not be limited to linear time on 
  Earth much longer. Isn't this the reason we came here to remember and to witness 
  this event? Do you remember? </p>
