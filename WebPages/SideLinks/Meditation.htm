  <p><b>Fitting Meditation Into an Already Crowded Life in the New Year (2004)</b></p>
  <p><b>by Douglas Imbrogno</b></p>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <p><b>&quot;The magazine Tricycle once ran a feature in which they asked: 'Why 
    do you meditate?' One person responded: 'It keeps me sane.' It's commonplace 
    nowadays to see references in newspapers, magazines and on TV, encouraging 
    us to take up yoga and meditation. As another new year commences many people 
    will fire up their good intentions and vow that, YES, IT'S TIME TO TAKE THAT 
    ADVICE. I'm heading for the cushion or mat in 2004. </b></p>
  <p><b>I'd like to offer my own perspective as someone who has had an on-again, 
    off-again meditation practice (mostly 'on' but a lot of times 'off') for more 
    than 10 years. I wish I could offer myself as more of an expert on meditation. 
    For several years I edited a Web journal called Hundred Mountain (still online 
    at www.hundredmountain.com). It features articles and columns about vispassana, 
    or insight meditation in the Buddhist tradition, the kind of meditation I 
    practice. The site encouraged people to begin meditation, to stick with it 
    and deepen their own practices. </b></p>
  <p><b>I am also one of the founding members of the Meditational Circle of Charleston 
    (West Virginia), a small...nondenominational group of people interested in 
    learning insight meditation--with a little help and support from their friends...</b></p>
  <p><b>We often have romantic notions about meditation and spiritual practices. 
    We also have a bunch of EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT CHANGE OUR LIVES. 
    So then we try to meditate. And then we often give it up because it seems 
    too hard to fit into OUR BUSY DAILY LIVES. Or just plain too hard. Then we 
    try again because an article or talk inspired us. Or maybe we had a taste 
    of something while trying meditation It's a taste of SOMETHING CLEARER OR 
    MORE PROFOUND than other things we do with OUR BODY AND MIND to address the 
    discomfort of distracted, often frantic modern lives.</b></p>
  <p><b>Even if we have had that taste, why are our mediation practices so erratic 
    and spotty? I am speaking for myself here. But I know from helping to lead 
    meditations in West Virginia that erratic meditation shedules...are the norm 
    for many of us lay people. Even just beginning is hard enough, which is why 
    group support can be essential. I know, though, that when I keep up a regular 
    meditation practice, MY LIFE'S UPS AND DOWNS smooth out considerably.</b></p>
  <b>One of my main meditation teachers is Bhante Henepola Gunaratana, founder 
  of the Bhavana Society Buddhist monastery and retreat center in Hampshire County 
  and author of the popular guide to meditation 'Mindfulness in Plain English' 
  (Wisdom Books). He says that if we are serious about meditation, we must be 
  firm with ourselves, WE MUST MAKE THE EFFORT AND STICK WITH IT.</b></div>
<div align="left"> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>I once asked him , 'If we are truly serious about our meditation practices, 
    how much should we be meditating every day?'...</b></p>
</div>
<div align="left"> 
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Hebrews 3:13 to 4:12 (KJV).</b></p>
</div>
<p><b>He responded, 'I think every day--at least 30 minutes IN THE MORNING, 30 
  minutes IN THE EVENING--you must meditate. The minimum. That is not a fixed 
  or mandatory limit, of course. But given people's active and bust lives, that 
  is the minimum, I think for someone who is serious about meditation practices...</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/30Tree.gif" width="576" height="242"></p>
<p><b>Sometimes, because of the way I choose to live my daily life, I fall completely 
  out of routine. Then I find nearly a week or two has gone by. I plead a too-busy 
  life. I plead exhaustion. I plead having to wake up to a busy household in which 
  my wife and I must get two children dressed, fed and off to school...Accordingly, 
  my life becomes rockier, a little crazier. Less sane in other words.</b></p>
<p><b>I have come to the realization (THE REALIZATION, MIND YOU, NOT NECESSARILY 
  THE RESOLVE) that the most pertinent question is not, 'How do I fit meditation 
  into my busy life?' The more useful question is, 'How do I fit my life around 
  my meditation practice?' Because if we don't make such a real commitment, ALL 
  OUR EFFORTS AT SPIRITUAL PRACTICE WILL BE JUST A SERIES OF INADEQUATE GOOD INTENTIONS, 
  EVEN DELUSIONS.</b></p>
<p><b>C. S. Lewis...once wrote: 'WE READ OF SPIRITUAL EFFORTS, AND OUR IMAGINATION 
  MAKES US BELIEVE THAT, BECAUSE WE ENJOY THE IDEA OF DOING THEM, WE HAVE DONE 
  THEM. I AM APPALLED TO SEE HOW MUCH OF THE CHANGE I THOUGHT I HAD UNDERGONE 
  LATELY WAS ONLY IMAGINARY. THE REAL WORK SEEMS STILL TO BE DONE. IT IS SO FATALLY 
  EASY TO CONFUSE AN AESTHETIC APPRECIATION OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE WITH THE LIFE 
  ITSELF--TO DREAM THAT YOU HAD WAKED, WASHED, AND DRESSED AND THEN TO FIND YOURSELF 
  STILL IN BED.'</b></p>
<p><b>So here is a wish for you--and for me--in 2004. May we all get some some 
  good rest tonight, AWAKE EARLY FROM BED and head for our respective cushions 
  and chairs. And not just dream of doing it.&quot;</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

  <p><b>MEDITATION TAMES THE MIND</b></p>
  <p><b>By Bhante Henepola Gunaratana</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;The variety of possible OBJECTS OF MEDITATION is nearly 
    unlimited, and human beings have used an enormous number down through the 
    ages. The method we are explaining here, however, is considered the most traditional 
    and is probably what Gotama Buddha taught his students. The Satipatthana Sutta, 
    the Buddha's original discourse on mindfulness, specifically says THAT ONE 
    MUST BEGIN BY FOCUSING THE ATTENTION ON THE BREATHING </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The 
    Word)</font><b> AND THEN GO ON TO NOTE ALL OTHER PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PHENOMENON 
    THAT ARISE. </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>We sit, watching the </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(invisible)</font><b> 
    AIR going in and out of our noses. At first glance, this seems an exceedingly 
    odd and useless procedure. Before going on to further instructions, let us 
    examine the reason behind it. The first question we might ask is WHY USE ANY 
    FOCUS OF ATTENTION AT ALL?...</b></p>

    Ps.118:19-23). </b></p>

<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These are 
    the 7 (descending and ascending) chakras, and the 22 pathways of the Sacred 
    Tree of Life. Along with the other systems of tantric thought, they are directly 
    related to the Seven primary levels of human consciousness. They are channels 
    flowing into and out of the natural realm, and connect the central points 
    of interaction that exist between the individual soul, the outside world, 
    and the presence of God who inhabits all. The soul's task, once it has descended 
    into the mystery of Life, is to explore the darkness--to go down, as it is, 
    into the empire of its own existence, and to engage the lower thought forms 
    (the &quot;enemy&quot;) and to overcome them wherever they are found. The 
    soul must spend its entire lifetime bringing the faculties of the body and 
    mind into subjection, and in the process illuminating or opening up the chakras 
    to the light of higher reality. When the lowest chakra is subdued--brought 
    under subjection and illuminated--the whole body is full of light, and the 
    mystical union between the Mind of God, and the mind of the individual soul 
    is completed. (Or rather can be completed with the proper alignment of concepts 
    and the right revelations.) The soul's descent into the lowest parts of its 
    own existence is directly analogous in the interior world to the Holy Nation's 
    descent on the historical plane to the lowest, most Western parts of the earth, 
    as it is written: ...that they might be called Trees of Righteousness, the 
    planting of the Lord, that He and She might be glorified...(Isaiah 61:3). 
    It is to fulfill the words, 'as above so below', 'On earth as it is in heaven.'&quot;</font></div>

  <p align="left"><b>...We are, after all, trying to develop awareness. Why not 
    just sit down and be aware of whatever happens to be present in the mind? 
    In fact there are meditations of that nature. They are sometimes referred 
    to as unstructured meditation, and they are quite difficult. THE MIND IS TRICKY. 
    Thought is an inherently complicated procedure. By that we mean we become 
    trapped, wrapped up and stuck in the thought chain. One thought leads to another, 
    which leads to another, and another and another, and so on. Fifteen minutes 
    later we suddenly wake up and realize we spent that whole time STUCK IN A 
    DAY DREAM or sexual fantasy or a set of worries about our bills or whatever.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>CONCENTRATION IS OUR MICROSCOPE FOR VIEWING SUBTLE INTERNAL 
    STATES. WE USE THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION TO ACHIEVE ONE-POINTEDNESS OF MIND...</b></p>

    FIXED REFERENCE POINT YOU GET LOST, overcome by the ceaseless flowing round 
    and round within the mind.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>We use the breath as our focus. It serves as that vital reference 
    point from which the mind wanders and is drawn back. Distraction cannot be 
    seen as distraction UNLESS THERE IS SOME CENTRAL FOCUS TO BE DISTRACTED FROM. 
    That is the frame of reference against which we can view the incessant changes 
    and interruptions that go on all the time as a part of normal thinking.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Ancient Pali texts liken meditation to the process of taming 
    a wild elephant. The procedure in those days was to tie a newly capture animal 
    to a post with a good strong rope. When you do this, the elephant is not happy. 
    He screams and tramples and pulls against the rope for days. Finally it sinks 
    through his skull that he can't get away and he settles down. At this point 
    you can begin to feed him and to handle him with some measure of safety. Eventually 
    you can dispense with the rope and post altogether, and train your elephant 
    for various tasks. Now you've got a tamed elephant that can be put to useful 
    work.</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>IN THIS ANALOGY, the wild elephant is your wildly active 
    mind, the rope is mindfulness, and the post is the object of meditation-breathing. 
    The tamed elephant that emerges from this process is a well-trained, concentrated 
    mind that can then be used for the exceedingly tough job of piercing the layers 
    of illusion that obscure reality. Meditation tames the mind.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TheCharleston

      be caught with the lasso of purpose, tied to the pole of meditation, fed 
      with the master's teachings, and watered from the stream of consciousness.

      plain of happiness, and arrives at last at the state of Buddhahood.&quot;
