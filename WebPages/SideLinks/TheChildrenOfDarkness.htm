<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For we were sometimes Darkness, but now ye are Light in 
    the Lord: walk as children of Light...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">AND HAVING NO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE UNFRUITFUL WORKS OF 
    DARKNESS, but rather reprove them.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For it is a shame even to speak of those things that are 
    done of them in secret.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But all things that are reproved are made manifest by 
    the Light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is Light...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ephesians 
    5:8-13).</font></p>
