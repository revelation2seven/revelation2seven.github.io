<p align="center"><b>The 22 Pathways and 10 Sefirot of the Sacred Tree of Life</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>The androgynous soul emanates from the World Soul, is conceived in it's 
    Mother's womb, at the navel of its own existence, and is born into the world 
    (according to its own nature, either female or male) in the image of Heaven 
    and Earth. As the spinal cortex begins to develop in the fetus, the Oracle 
    (the guiding principles of Life) take form... </b></p>
  <p><b>These are the dimensions of the Oracle (the Sacred Tree of Life), and, 
    along with all other systems of tantric thought, they are directly related 
    to the Seven primary levels of human consciousness. They are channels into 
    and out of this realm, and connect the central points of interaction that 
    exist between the individual soul, the outside world, and the <i>invisible</i> 
    presence of God who inhabits all. (God is not invisible to those who can see 
    Them). The soul's task, once it has entered into the mystery of Life, is to 
    explore the darkness, that is to go down into the empire of its own existence, 
    and to engage the lower thought forms (the enemy) and to overcome them wherever 
    they are found. The soul must spend its entire lifetime bringing the faculties 
    of the body and mind into subjection (into harmony with each other), and in 
    the process illuminating or opening up the chakras to the light of higher 
    reality. When the lowest chakra (centered in the Libidinal impulse) is subdued--brought 
    under subjection, illuminated--the whole body is full of light, and the mystical 
    union between the Mind of God, and the mind of the individual soul is completed. 
    (Or rather can be completed with the proper alignment of concepts and right 
    revelations.) The soul's descent into the lowest parts of its own existence 
    is directly analogous in the interior world to the Holy Nation's descent on 
    the historical plane to the lowest, most Western parts of the earth, as it 
    is written: <i>...That they might be called Trees of Righteousness, the planting 
    of the Lord, that He and She might be glorified.</i>.. (Isaiah 61:3). It is 
    to fulfill the words, 'as above so below', <i>On earth as it is in heaven</i>.</b></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Nevertheless, yielding to a legalistic, 
    as well as dualistic point of view, and in the spirit of Shammai, James says):</font><i><font size="+1">

    tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his 
    own lust, and enticed.</font></i></p>

    two words. A 'Derekh' is a public road, a route used by all people. A 'Nativ,' 
    on the other hand, is a personal route, a path blazed by the individual for 
    his personal use. It is a hidden path, without markers or signposts, which

  <p><b>&quot;The covenant of circumcision also represents the channeling of sexual 
    energy. The sexual drive is one of the most powerful psychological forces 
    in man, and when it is channeled along spiritual lines, it can help bring 
    one to the highest mystical states. In giving the commandment of circumcision, 
    God indicated that the emotions and desires associated with sex could be used 
    for the mystical quest of the Divine on a transcendental plane.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The juxtaposition between the 'circumcision of the tongue' and the 
    'circumcision of the membrum' explains the prophetic position favored by Elijah. 
    The scripture states, 'Elijah went up to the top of the Carmel, entranced 
    himself on the ground, and placed his face between his knees.' (1 Kings 18:42). 
    This position was used for the intense concentration of spiritual energy. 
    According to the Midrash, this position was used because it placed the head 
    in conjunction with the mark of circumcision.</b></p>
  <p><b>When one is in this position, all the forces are brought together. The 
    ten fingers, ten toes, tongue and sexual organ comprise a total of 22 elements,

    thus becomes an alphabet, with which he can 'write' in the spiritual realm.&quot;

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;The word for 'vision' here is <i>Tzafiyah</i>, which usually denotes 
    a prophetical or mystical vision. The Hekhalot, and ancient mystical text 
    which might be contemporary to Sefer Yetzirah, speaks of the 'vision' of the 
    Merkava. The Merkava is the divine Chariot seen in Ezekiel's vision, and the 
    term is used to denote the mystical experience on its highest levels.</b></p>
  <p><b>The Sefer Yetzirah is now describing (in Chapter One) how the Sefirot 
    appear in a mystical vision. In earlier sections, the text spoke of the exercises 
    used to visualize the Sefirot, and now it describes their appearance.</b></p>
  <p><b>The Bahir, another very ancient text, explains that the word <i>Tzafiyah</i>, 
    derived from the root <i>Tzafah</i>, indicates that one is looking down from 
    a high place. In the previous section, the Sefer Yetzirah spoke of the Sefirot 
    as Ten 'depths.' When one looks into a depth, however, one is usually looking 
    downward. In the Hekhalot, the mystical experience is often described as A 
    DESCENT IN A DOWNWARD DIRECTION, and is often called 'DESCENDING TO THE MERKAVA.'</b></p>
  <p><b>One reason why gazing at the Sefirot is called a 'descent' is because 
    in order to accomplish this, one must first attain Hohkmah consciousness </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Divine 
    Wisdom)</font><b>, as discussed earlier. In the array of the Sefirot, however, 
    Hohkmah is the highest, at least of those which are approachable. In climbing 
    the Tree of 32 paths of Wisdom, one must begin by attaching himself to Hohkmah 
    (Wisdom). When this is accomplished, one then looks down on the other Sefirot. 
    Only then does one begin climbing the Sefirot, BEGINNING AT THE LOWEST.&quot; 
    </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kaplan, p.52</font><b>.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;It is in this context that the Kabbalists advised those who were 
    attempting to reach the highest levels to bind their soul with an oath that 
    it should return to their body. Besides such individual oaths, there is also 
    a general covenant that implies that the soul will be able to return, even 
    from the highest levels.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>In more general terms, a covenant is something that comes between two 
    things and joins them. This is the covenant that joins the spiritual and the 
    physical. In particular, as the Sefer Yetzirah states (1:3), a covenant denotes 
    circumcision. One of the reasons for circumcision is to indicate that one 
    should be able to control one's sexual passions. Communion with the spirit 
    is also sexual in a sense, and the covenant of circumcision also helps to 
    control this passion. A person who can control his sexual passions even at 
    the height of desire, can also control his mind when it enters the spiritual 
    realm.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kaplan,p.68</font><b>.</b></p>
