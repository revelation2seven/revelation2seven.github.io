  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Salisbury Plain in southern 
    England stands an awesome arrangement of stones that has been the subject 
    of countless studies, poems, and legends dating back beyond the days of King 
    Arthur and his court. What did this somber group of stones signify to its 
    architects? Was it a city of the dead?...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...A Druid altar of sacrifice? 
    A temple to the Sun? It took the 20th Century, an astronomer, and computer 
    techniques to unravel the ancient mystery.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dramatic decoding of the mystery 
    began when astronomer Gerald Hawkins decided decided to investigate the reason 
    for that particular, peculiar arrangement of stones at Stonehenge. He stood 
    at each position and measured its various alignments. He got up in the middle 
    of the night to photograph the dramatic midsummer sunrise over the giant heel 
    stone. Back in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he fed the measurement he had taken 
    and certain astronomical data into a huge computer and his original theories 
    were confirmed. The dramatic facts were: Each significant stone aligns with 
    at least one other point to some extreme position of the sun and moon.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">__The mysterious aubrey holes were 
    probably used as an eclipse predictor. All the evidence indicated that Stonehenge 
    was a sophisticated and brilliantly conceived astronomical observatory, used 
    by three different groups over a 400 year period BEGINNING AROUND 1900 B.C.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Dr. Hawkings recreates his dramatic 
    discovery he tells of the mythology that has grown up around Stonehenge and 
    of the remarkable techniques that were employed to bring the stones across 
    100 miles of sea and land to their site of construction. Anyone who has seen 
    a picture of the fabulous structure will be enthralled by this captivating 
    account of one of the most significant archeological and astronomical discoveries 
    of our time. </font>The Jacket Introduction to <i>Stonehenge Decoded</i>,

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">The following is Gerald S. Hawkings chapter on 
  the Druids, an account of his own opinions of what others have written of the 
  Druids and their connection to the monument at Stonehenge. He disputes much 
  of it, on the supposition, however, that the Druids (whoever they were, or whatever 
  their beliefs), did not find their way to Britain until the 5th century B.C., 
  and therefore well after the stones were erected and their ancient purpose established. 
  He quotes John Aubrey, an early proponant of the Druid-Stonehenge theory (and 
  then begins his own account):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;There have been several Books writt by learned men concerning Stoneheng, 
    much differing from one another, some affirming one thing, some another. Now 
    I have come in the Rear of all by comparative Arguments to give a clear evidence 
    these monuments...were Pagan Temples; which was not made-out before: and have 
    also, with humble submission to better judgments, offered a probability, that 
    they were Temples of the Druids...</p>
  <p>&quot;...my presumption is, that the Druids being the most eminent Priests, 
    or Order of Priests, among the Britaines; 'tis odds, but that these ancient 
    monuments...were Temples of the priests of the most eminent Order, viz. Druids, 
    and...are as ancient as those times. This inquiry, I must confess, is a gropeing 
    in the Dark; but although I have not brought it into a clear light; yet I 
    can affirm that I have brought it from an utter darkness to a thin mist, and 
    have gone further in this Essay than any one before me...&quot;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Aubrey was right about Stonehenge 
    being more ancient than Roman or Saxon times, and possibly right about it 
    having at some time served as a druid temple, but probably not right in his 
    implied assumption that the druids built it. John Aubrey did much good work 
    at Stonehenge, but his linking of the monument to the druids was a doubtful 
    service. </font>(continued)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>

  good place to submit William Blakes' <i>To The Jews:</i></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TO THE JEWS</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Jerusalem the Emanation of 
    Giant Albion! Can it be? Is it the truth that the learned have explored? Was 
    Britain the primitive seat of the Patriarchal Religion? If it is true, my

    Albion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is true and cannot be controverted. 
    Ye are united O ye inhabitants of the earth, in One Religion, the Religion

    Amen! Huzza! Selah! </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your ancestors derived their origins

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Hawkins continued:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There <i>were</i> druids. 
    And they did come to Britain. But did they come before Stonehenge existed, 
    or even when it was new? Were they its high priests? We do not know--but the 
    evidence now </font>(he will say)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    is quite strong against that supposition.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There is, however, strong 
    and continued interest in these glamorous, over-romanticized beings, and so 
    much misunderstanding concerning their possible connection with Stonehenge, 
    that a discussion of what is actually known about the druids seems in order 
    here, to set the record straight. The druids were the holy men, medicine men, 
    teachers and judges of the Celts. Classic literature abounds in references 
    to them. Caesar's account in <i>Gallic Wars</i> is the most straightforward:</font></p>
  <p>&quot;Throughout Gall there are two classes of persons of definite account 
    and dignity. As for the common folk, they are treated almost as slaves... 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">(Recall here, not only the points we have been striving at 
  throughout the whole of this work, thus that Caesar's account of the religious 
  affairs of Western Europe predates the arrival of Christianity, when the early 
  adepts of what would become the Christian mysteries returned to Central Europe 
  after the times of John the Baptist (Open the Book of Acts), and then afterwards 
  to the West--to Britain and beyond--after Paul's doctrines of &quot;Christ, 
  and him Crucified&quot; were admitted into the consciousness of the early Church). 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>...One consists of druids, the other of knights. The former are concerned 
    with divine worship, the due performance of sacrifices, public and private, 
    and the interpretation of ritual questions: a great number of young men gather 
    about them for the sake of instruction and hold them in great honour...It 
    is they who decide in almost all disputes...and if any crime has been committed 
    or murder done, or if there is any dispute about succession or boundaries, 
    they also decide...OF ALL THESE DRUIDS ONE IS CHIEF...it is believed that 
    their rule of life was discovered in Britain and tranferred thence to Gaul...</p>
  <p>&quot;Report says that in the schools of the druids THEY LEARN BY HEART A 
    GREAT NUMBER OF VERSES, and therefore some persons remain twenty years under 
    training...THEY MAKE USE OF GREEK LETTERS...the cardinal doctrine which they 
    seek to teach IS THAT SOULS DO NOT DIE, BUT PASS AFTER DEATH FROM ONE TO ANOTHER...BESIDES 
    THIS THEY HAVE MANY DISCUSSIONS AS TOUCHING THE STARS AND THEIR MOVEMENT, 
    THE SIZE OF THE UNIVERSE AND OF THE EARTH...The whole nation of the Gauls 
    is greatly devoted to ritual observances, and for that reason those who are 
    smitten with the more grevious maladies and who are engaged in the perils 
    of battle EITHER SACRIFICE HUMAN VICTIMS OR VOW TO DO SO, EMPLOYING THE DRUIDS 
    AS MINISTERS OF SUCH SACRIFICES. THEY BELIEVE, IN EFFECT, THAT, UNLESS FOR 
    A MAN'S LIFE A MAN'S LIFE IS PAID, THE MAJESTY OF THE IMMORTAL GODS MAY NOT 
    BE APPEASED...others use a figure of an immense size, whose limbs, woven out 
    of twigs, they fill with living men and set on fire, and the men perish in 
    a sheet of flame. They believe that the execution of those who have been caught 
    in the act of theft or robbery or some crime is more pleasing to the immortal 
    gods; BUT WHEN THE SUPPLY OF SUCH FAILS THEY RESORT TO THE EXECUTION EVEN 
    OF THE INNOCENT...&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The Gauls affirm that they are descended from a common father, Dis 
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Please understand Psalm 18:11)</font>, 
    and say that this is the tradition of the druids. For that reason they determine 
    all periods of time by the number, not of days, but of nights <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(in 
    other words, by the Moon)</font>, and in their observance of birthdays and 
    the beginning of months and years days follows night...&quot;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;(Dis was the god of the dark 
    underworld; the term 'fortnight' still bespeaks the custom of measuring time 
    by nights </font>(moons)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> rather 
    than days). Pliny described the druids more romantically. He professed to 
    despise &quot;Art Magicke,&quot; as he called it, but he respected its possible 
    powers, and he thought it his duty to set forth its history, and the history 
    of those who practiced it. The quotation is taken from the 1601 Holland translation 
    of Pliny because the archaic language seems best to fit the thought...</font></p>
  <p>&quot;The sundrie kinds of magicke...execrable acts...may be practiced after 
    various sorts...for it worketh by means of Water, Globes of Balls, Aire, Stars, 
    Fire-lights, Basons and Axes...The follie and vanitie of Art Magicke...entermingled 
    with medicinable receits and religious ceremonies, the skill of Astrologie 
    and arts Mathematicall...In the realm of Persia, it found first footing, and 
    was practiced there by Zoroastes...5000 years before the War of Troy.&quot; 
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Hawkins adds: Actually, Zoroaster, 
    or Zarathustra, lived in Persia about 600 B.C.)</font>.</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Pliny said that Orpheus, 
    Pythagorus, Empedocles and Plato 'were so far in love' with the magic art 
    that they 'undertook many voyages' for its sake, and 'this art they blazed 
    abroad and highly praised.' HE SAID MOSES ALSO WAS A MAGICIAN. Then the art 
    came to 'Fraunce,' and there...</font></p>
  <p>&quot;continued untill our daies: for no longer is it agoe than since the 
    time of Tiberius Caesar, that their Druidae (the Priests and Wise Men of France) 
    were by his authoritie put down, TOGITHER WITH ALL THE PACK OF SUCH PHYSICIANS, 
    PROPHETS, AND WIZARDS. But what should I discourse any longer in this wise, 
    of that Art WHICH HATH PASSED OVER THE WIDE OCEAN ALSO, AND GONE AS FAR AS 
    ANY LAND IS TO BE SEEN, EVEN TO THE UTMOST BOUNDS OF THE EARTH; AND BEYOND 
    which, there is nothing to be discovered but a vast prospect of Aire and Water, 
    and verely in Britain atthis day it is highly honoured, where the people are...wholly 
    devoted to it...</p>
  <p>&quot;The Druidae...esteem nothing more sacred in the world, than Misselto, 
    AND THE TREE WHEREUPON IT BREEDETH, SO IT BE ON OKE...they may seeme well 
    enough to be named thereupon Dryidae in Greek, which signifieth...OKE PRIESTS 
    [the Greek word for &quot;oak&quot; was &quot;drus&quot; and Pliny's etymology 
    may have been correct]...Misselto...they gather...very devoutlyand with many 
    ceremonies [WHEN THE] MOON BE JUST SIX DAYS OLD (FOR UPON THAT DAY THEY BEGIN 
    THEIR MONETHS AND NEW YEARES, YEA, AND THEIR SEVERAL AGES, WHICH HAVE THEIR

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">B</font><font size="+1">y now we should already be acquiring 
  a sense of who Samuel and Nathan were, and of the nature of their relationship 
  to the <i>legendary</i> kings of Israel; and even of the relationship that Jethro 
  the fabled priest of <i>Midian </i>had to Moses centuries before (he was the 
  High Priest of the ancient Druid Order--an office that Aaron and his <i>sons</i> 
  assumed when Israel returned to Europe under the direction of Joshua); and therefore 
  of the entire Levitical order (the Druid-priests of old), but also of all the 
  Hebrew prophets who roamed the earth in those times. We should not only be seeing 
  the Druid connection to the Hebrew Solar/Lunar mysteries (and their eventual 
  perversion if you will, of both the literal <i>and</i> hidden, oral traditions 
  of Moses' Torah), but also understanding the meanings of those corrections and 
  higher, spiritual translations the early Christians (those druid-like Essenes 
  and others) brought with them on their return from the East, as their teachings 
  and literary works began to take a greater hold in the earth. And then we should 
  also be able to comprehend the nature of the even greater apostasy that soon 
  followed, as the colossal World Church (the new Druid Order) rose up in the 
  name of Christ, perverting once again (unable to translate the mysteries, as 
  it were, as the druids before them) the higher, epic meanings of those documents 
  that came into their possession. As Paul wrote: <i>Their must be heresies among 
  you, so that those who are approved may be manifest</i>. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1">Hawkins continues: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Perhaps 
    with time druids softened their customs and became more humane. Later accounts 
    of them stress their wisdom, healing and teaching ability, and their judging. 
    Their mystical powers were described as less savagely dependent on human sacrifice: 
    they raised magic mists, cast 'enervating spells,' prophesied and in general 
    attended to the ritualistic life of the people without demanding blood--or 
    so say the accounts. It is always hard to find out about pagan priesthoods 
    like the druids because so much of the literature about them has been filtered 
    through Christian transmission.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The best estimate is that the druids 
    came with the Celts to Britain in about the fifth century B.C., and soon became 
    the most influential priestly cult in the land. For centuries they were powerful. 
    Indeed, they survived as priests, judges, doctors and educators, particularly 
    of the royal young, after the Christians came to Britain in about the third 
    century. More than six hundred years later Alfred the Great translated warnings 
    against those who were 'prone like beasts...baleful' in the following of 'all 
    this druidcraft.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Savage or benign, the druids were 
    the most picturesque. And the memory of them was never lost. In the seventeenth 
    century interest in them revived. Samuel Butler in his satiric poem <i>Hudibras</i> 
    scoffed at their belief in immortality--'Like money by the Druids borrow'd,/ 
    In th' other world to be restor'd...'--but in general they inspired respectful 
    curiosity. They still do. In 1781 a group calling itself 'The Most Ancient 
    Order of Druids' was established in London, and still flourishes. This group 
    regards 'Druidry' as more mystical and philosophical than religious, and lays 
    claim to ancient, arcane wisdom inherited from semimythical people like the 
    inhabitants of the lost continent, Atlantis...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="+3">A Mystery in Northeast Georgia</font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Most of State 77 looks like any other two-lane blacktop road winding through 
    rural northeastern Georgia. Small farmhouses sit back from the highway, and 
    cattle graze in the pastures along the roadside. But in one pasture a few 
    miles from the Georgia-South Carolina state lines, a huge granite monument 
    called the Georgia Guidestones turns the heads of people passing by.</b></p>
  <p><b>Rising nearly 20 feet in the air, the guidestones could easily be mistaken 
    for the ancient Stonehenge monument in England. The unusual structure is possibly 
    the largest granite monument ever constructed, according to Hudson Cone of 
    the Elberton Granite Association. It is certainly one of the most mysterious.</b></p>
  <p><b>Five upright granite slabs, each weighing more than 40,000 pounds, support 
    a center &quot;gnomon&quot; stone. Covering the slabs, written in eight languages, 
    are the guides, 10 rules for rebuilding civilization if there ever is a need. 
    And like the ancient Druid structure that inspired these markers, astronomical 
    features mark the rising of the North Star and the sun, as well as the summer 
    and winter solstices.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Guidestones2.gif" width="372" height="250"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>The Georgia Guidestones were quarried, carved, and set up by a granite 
    company in nearby Elberton. But the identities of the people who designed 
    and paid for the huge monument remain a mystery. According to Cone, the strange 
    tale started one Friday afternoon in 1979, when a visitor met with Joe Fendley, 
    president of the Elberton Granite Finishing Company and mayor of the town. 
    The stranger told Fendley his plans for the giant monument and asked if the 
    Elberton company could build the Guidestones &quot;Fendley thought the man 
    was kidding,&quot; Cone recalls. &quot;He told him what something of that 
    size would cost and the guy said 'no problem.'&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>Elberton's stonecarvers went to work, carefully inscribing the 10 guides 
    onto the huge granite slabs that had been hauled from one of the city's quarries. 
    The guides were written in English, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, 
    Swahili and Spanish. Among other things, the rules warn future generations 
    to &quot;avoid petty laws and useless officials,&quot; &quot;protect people 
    and nations with fair laws and just courts,&quot; and &quot;unite humanity 
    with a living new language.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>Why pick an out-of-the-way place like Elberton, Georgia, to put up a guide 
    for the future? According to Cone, &quot;they needed a place with a warm climate 
    near a granite production area. So this was the best place they could find. 
    But other residents point out that this section of northeast Georgia has always 
    been a place of mystery. A historical marker about a half mile from the guidestones 
    relates that the Cherokees considered the area &quot;the center of the world,&quot; 
    and for centuries they held religious ceremonies nearby. Only the people who 
    designed the monument know for sure if its part of that long mystical tradition.</b></p>

  circumstances of history from the days of Antiochus Epiphanes to his own...and 
  so committed many involuntary errors therein.&quot; The matter at hand had to 
  do with an alleged visit by Alexander the Great to the temple <i>in Jerusalem</i>, 
  upon which he was met by this Simeon, or a Jaddua, or some other priestly figure 
  of legendary stature. In an article on Alexander the Great the <i>Encyclopedia 
  Judaica </i>states:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The legend in Josephus ascribes 
    to Alexander things which are highly improbable. After the battle of Issus, 
    Alexander set out hurriedly for Egypt in order to dislodge the Persians from 
    the Mediterranean coast. The siege of Tyre was protracted and Alexander had 
    no time to turn aside from his man route in order to visit a city as unimportant 
    as Jerusalem was then </font>(which is true)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    or the Jews, who were a small nation. It is obvious </font>(?)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    that Alexander advanced with his army along the coasts and did not then visit 
    the interior of the country.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The author of this article is correct, but how would he or 
  she know if Alexander did or did not visit that place? If that city in Palestine 
  really was the focus of God's Eye in the world why wouldn't Alexander want to 
  turn aside for the mere two hours it would take to get there, to visit it? The 
  article, of course, though correct, hangs on the belief that that land there 
  in Palestine, is actually the &quot;land of Israel,&quot; and that it is a territory 
  of some vaster (or greater interior) proportions than it really is. Josephus, 
  nevertheless (not to confuse that event with the real event), has one Jaddua, 
  the high Priest, coming out to meet Alexander. Talmudic legends, not understanding 
  what they are reporting, or the meaning of the tradition they have preserved 
  and handed down, say it was Simeon the Just:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;People came and informed

    he (Alexander) said, 'Who are these?'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They answered&quot; 'The Jews who 
    rebelled against you.' When he reached Antipatras, and the Sun shone, they 
    met. On seeing Simeon the Just, Alexander descended from his chariot, and

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Sorting our way through the controversy, we read:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The chronology of the period 
    is obscure. The date of Ezra is 444 B.C. or thereabouts. Simeon the Just is 
    one of the two men of whom the older was High Priest from B.C. 310 to 291 
    (or 300 to 270), and the younger (grandson of the elder) was High Priest from 
    B.C. 219-199. Josephus mentions both, Antiq. XII.2.5 and XII.4.10; but he 
    only applies the epithet &quot;the Just&quot; in connection with the older 
    Simeon...If then the elder Simeon be the one referred to as being of the remnants 
    of the Great Synagogue, there is an interval of 110 years between his death...and 
    the death of Jose ben Joezer in B.C. 160. Antigonus of Socho must be placed 
    somewhere within this period, and there is a period of eighty years to be 
    accounted for. The teacher or teachers during those eighty years, if there 
    were any, may have been of too slight importance for their names to be remembered...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Antigonos of Socho. The name is 
    Greek, and may possibly represent some Hebrew name; the teacher was of course 
    a Jew, but the period in which he lived, was one in which Hellenism had become 
    strong as an influence in Jewish life and thought...'FEAR OF HEAVEN,' means 
    the fear of God. Except in Biblical quotations the word God is rather avoided 
    in the Rabbinical literature. It is more usual to speak of 'the Holy One blessed 
    be He,' or 'Lord of the Worlds' or 'King of the kings.' or 'the Name,' or 
    'The Place,' meaning the 'All Present.' The term 'Our Father who is in Heaven' 
    is well authenticated in Jewish usage, but does not occur very frequently. 
    It is of Jewish not Christian origin. All these expressions are found in 'Aboth.'

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The period in question here is one in which the history, and 
  many of the written records of Israel were passing back out of Europe into the 
  East again. Using the spread of Hellenic culture as its vehicle the mysteries 
  of Israel came down unnoticed to the world at large. The religious commerce 
  between Europe and the East had been going on for centuries, and thus there 
  were no historical alarms going off, or flags being raised as it was happening. 
  Nor do religious historians take note of those conflicts that were being waged 
  between the Selucids and the Ptolemies on the mainland of Europe, as well as 
  in the East, or of the saga of those (Celto-Thracian) Maccabees who also came 
  across the Hellespont into the East at that time. And therefore history barely 
  noticed what all the further conflict was about when all these things were being 
  just as cryptically resurrected again in the Mystery of Christ:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three 
    sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg152.gif" width="480" height="169"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Opening and alleging, that Christ </font></i><i><font size="+1">must 
    needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
    mystery of the Druid Hesus suspended on the limbs of the Cosmic Tree)</font><font size="+1"></font><font size="+1">, 
    <i>whom I preach unto you is Christ...</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took 
    unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, 
    and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought 
    to bring them out to the people.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain 
    brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, THESE THAT HAVE TURNED THE WORLD 
    UPSIDE DOWN ARE COME HITHER ALSO...</font></i><font size="+1">(Acts 17:1-6).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus given the conflicts that eventually set the rabbis apart 
  from the later Christians (from those who had no idea themselves what these 
  things were all about), the compilers of the Mishna, being of a Puritanical 
  (and Zionist) persuasion themselves, were not disposed to what for them were 
  <i>foreign</i> ideas either. (The analogy is not fully acurate, but trying to 
  convince the rabbis of that time that the Christians were the true expositors 
  of the Torah, must have been like trying to convince traditional Christians 
  that the Church of Latter Day Saints are the true expositors of the Torah in 
  our times...which, of course, they are not). Besides, the rabbis were not interested 
  in history so much as in the Torah itself. They were interested in preserving 
  Torah Judaism. They were interested in <i>holiness</i>. Nor did they have any 
  idea as to the original source of t heir materials, or the direction from which 
  these traditions came to them. (The Mishna was finally compiled by Rabbi Judah 
  at the end of the second century A.D.). The temple was gone thus a curse on 
  all their houses. All that they knew for certain was that the pieces and the 
  fragments that were brought together to produce the Mishna, came to them with 
  written instructions to &quot;make a hedge for the Torah.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These particular Jews (and there were many other sects of Jews 
  at that time besides these Pharisees), were being specifically set aside by 
  the Spirit to preserve the written elements of the Torah, and to keep them intact. 
  This, so that finally, in the dynamic that exists between the <i>Letter</i> 
  of the Law and the true <i>Spirit</i> of the Law, and in the light of unfolding, 
  present historical realities, the true mystery of the Law, and the true meanings 
  of the Law, could be revealed. As such, the compilers of the Mishna, and those 
  who followed them, could not have known that the story relating Alexander's 
  encounter with the High Priest of Israel had nothing to do with events that 
  occurred in Palestine at all, but resulted from a record of events which recounted 
  a more famous meeting that took place between Alexander and the Jewish High 
  Priest of Central Europe. This encounter was preserved in history by Ptolemy, 
  who went on to become the military governor and eventual king of Egypt after 
  Alexander's death:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;...Too shrewd to pursue horsemen 
    as they escaped over the Romanian plains, they set up their own standards 
    on the edge of the river and spread the news that a Macedonian prince had 
    advance to the extreme northern frontier of the Greek world and meant to keep 
    it. This message must have counted as something of a sensation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There came, from all corners, barbarian 
    chiefs to visit the young man challenging them in their own sphere. One even 
    came from the upper Danube, and his visit won him a place, albeit anonymous, 
    in history. Alexander probably received him with especial curiosity. As a 
    reader of Herodotus he was well aware that the Danube rises in the land of 
    the Celts. The man thus belonged to a people about whom he must have at least 
    heard reports and with whom his western subjects, on the Albanian coast, must 
    have had some contact for many years. Moreover, as his biographers rarely 
    omit to mention, Alexander's father had been slain by a Celtic dagger...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Alexander discussed with him, 
    and in what language, we do not know. Only Ptolemy, a friend of the young 
    king, has recorded parts of the conversation for posterity. Alexander, he 
    reports, asked the Celt what his people most feared, 'naturally in the hope 
    that he would reply that it was himself.&quot; But the answer was unexpected. 
    The Celt tersely replied that they feared nothing so much as the possibility 
    'THAT THE HEAVENS MIGHT FALL ON THEIR HEADS.' His words must have impressed 
    the officers present in the tent more than we can understand...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There must have been more to it. 
    Ptolemy could still remember the Celt's answer when, thirty years later, and 
    long since king of Egypt, he dictated a biography of his dead sovereign...Modern 
    scholars have puzzled over this enigmatic reply until it became clear that 
    what seemed rash revealed an attitude to life that was shared by peoples of 
    similar spirit, such as the Achean Greeks, the heroes of Homer...This in turn 
    leads one to suppose that the Celt had uttered words that were, to him, tremendously 
    important and therefore struck a common chord in the leader of the half-savage 
    Macedonians.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We may assume that Alexander must 
    have been moved. The young ruler, already in the process of conquering half 
    the world, was learning in his career that there were men who respected no 
    material barriers, recognizing only the limitations that fate imposed. In 
    his situation this must have affected him almost like an omen.&quot; </font>The 
    Celts, by Gerhard Herm, p.35<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The recollections of his father were no doubt the reason Ptolemy 
  Philadelphus (285 to 247 B.C.), sent into Europe, when he was amassing the library 
  at Alexandria, to procure a copy of the Torah translated into the Greek language. 
  The work resulted in the Septuagint Version of the Bible (the LXX), which greatly 
  assisted in the rise of Christianity more than two centuries later (which in 
  turn led to the eventual translation of the Bible into English, and to our present 
  interpretations of the Torah). That the histories and the records of Israel 
  were in a wholesale state of disarray (or disemmination) at that time, with 
  various, and contending factions of Jews ranging from one end of the known world 
  to the other, is further evidenced in the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us 
    confusion of faces, as it is this day; </font></i><font size="+1"><i>to the 
    men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that 
    are near, and that are far off</i></font><i><font size="+1">, through all 
    the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their tresspass which 
    they have trespassed against thee.</font></i></p>

    because we have sinned against thee...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 9:7,8).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Both the Western and Eastern churches that emerged out of the 
  confusions of those times, from the reign of Constantine onwards, held that 
  its priestly office, its canon of authority, and its magesterium, all proceeded--with 
  a Christian interpretation of course--from the rites of the Levitical order 
  and the Jewish temple...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg29a.gif" width="400" height="427"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">Hebrews, chapters 5 to 10...(KJV)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> ...And so it did, but further study reveals this branch of 
  the Levitical order (Christianity), and thus the Catholic order of priests that 
  eventually proceeded from it (after the time of Constantine), to be more closely 
  related to the Druids of Europe than to the Saducees who officiated at that 
  temple in the East:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The two privileged classes 
    are the Druids and the Knights. The Druids officiate at the worship of the 
    gods </font>(or what to them are the higher ideas)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    regulate public and private sacrifices, and give rulings on all religious 
    questions. Large numbers of young men flock to them for instruction, and they 
    are held in great honour by the people. They act as judges in practically 
    all disputes, whether between tribes or between individuals...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the Druids are under one head, 
    whom they hold in the highest respect. On his death, if any of the rest is 
    of outstanding merit, he succeeds to the vacant place; if several have equal 
    claims, the Druids usually decide the election by voting, though sometimes 
    they fight it out. On a fixed date in each year they hold a session in a consecrated 
    spot in the country of the Carnutes, which is supposed to be the center of 
    Gaul; even today those who want to make a profound study of it generally go 
    to Britain for the purpose...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Druids are exempt from military 
    service and do not pay taxes as other citizens. These important privileges 
    are naturally attractive: many present themselves of their own accord to become 
    students of Druidism...It is said that these pupils have to memorize a great 
    number of verses--so many that some spend Twenty years in their studies. The 
    Druids believe that their religion forbids them to commit their teachings 
    to writings, although for most other purposes the Gauls use the Greek alphabet. 
    But I imagine that this rule was originally established for other reasons--because 
    they did not want their doctrines to become public property...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A lesson which they take particular 
    pains to inculcate is that the soul does not perish, but after death passes 
    from one body to another; they think that this is the best incentive to bravery, 
    because it teaches men to disregard the terrors of death. They also hold long 
    discussions about the heavenly bodies and their movements, the size of the 
    universe and the earth, the physical constitution of the world, and the power 
    and properties of the gods; and they instruct young men in all these subjects...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a nation the Gauls are extremely 
    superstitious; and so persons suffering from serious diseases, as well as 
    those who are exposed to the perils of battle, offer, or vow to offer, human 
    sacrifices, for the performance of which they employ Druids. They believe 
    that the only way of saving a man's life is to propitiate the god's wrath 
    by rendering another life in its place.&quot; </font>Julius Caesar, The Conquest

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">What we discover in Caesar's narrative is a (fallen) pre-Christian 
  observation of the Christian mysteries. We will also discover in another chapter 
  how the cult of Hesus (or Jesus), was an already-established religious phenomenon 
  in Europe before the time of Christ, but we must say something more about it 
  here as we discuss the Druid institution of human sacrifice, in order to further 
  see how the mysteries of Europe constituted the central core of the Judaeo-Christian 
  tradition. Caesar continues:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What is this colossal wickerwork but some fallen and perverse 
  Druid sense of the Great Corporate Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12), in which 
  evil doers shall indeed be brought to justice (especially as the Fires of Divine 
  Judgment are fully ignited at the end of the age)? ...and within which the righteous 
  have indeed offered themselves up as an atoning sacrifice? It is exactly what 
  Paul alludes to when he says: <i>...and though I give my body to be burned</i>. 
  (1 Corinthians 13:3).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When the Druids of Western Europe sacrificed unwilling victims 
  upon the cross (or in gross wickerworks), or when they executed men in any fashion 
  whatsoever, it was an immediate testimony of their inabilities to interpret 
  the precepts of the Torah (of which they were in possession). But how much further 
  were they from understanding the inner meanings of the Torah than the priests 
  who were officiating over animal sacrifices in Jerusalem? And how much further 
  were they fallen than the Church of today? It are no closer to observing the 
  inner, <i>non-violent</i> tenets of the mystery of Christ in our time (where 
  one is called upon to offer their own life as an atonement for sin) than the 
  Druids were in their time...that is, the Druids then were no further departed 
  from the true meanings of the Law of Moses, from which their observances sprang, 
  than Christianity is in our times...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Moses, looking into the Oracle, thus far off into the future, 
  said... </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>If a man has committed a sin worthy of death and he be 
    put to death, And thou hang him on a Tree; His Body shall not remain all Night 
    upon the Tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him That Day; (For he that 
    is hanged is accursed of God); that the land be not defiled that the Lord 
    thy God giveth thee for an inheritance...</i>(Deuteronomy 21:22,23).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...but the Druids (many of whom went on to become the earliest 
  converts to Christianity), having lost access to the true and epic meanings 
  of Divine Law--not perceiving how the righteous were indeed sent forward to 
  bear in their own lives, and in their own persecutions, the curse of the law 
  itself--literally hung their victims on trees. And in so doing they could not 
  understand how they themselves were the truly &quot;cursed ones,&quot; and that 
  it was they themselves who needed to die (to their own fallen ways that is), 
  before they could come alive to the ways of true understanding and true righteousness.We 
  in our time, however, who profess to know that &quot;the law is spiritual,&quot; 
  and that &quot;Christ is the fulfilling of the law,&quot; do the very same violence 
  to the precepts of Moses. We read: <i>When thou goest out to battle...the priest 
  shall approach and speak to the people...</i>(Deuteronomy 20:1-4), and then 
  literally send an army of chaplains, priests, reverends, rabbis, and imams, 
  out to comfort and enlist young men and women in the un-holy causes of the Gentiles 
  and non-believers, in the commission of their un-holy wars against the truth 
  and each other. Like the Druids of old we are grossly fallen from the twin precepts: 
  <i>The Letter killeth</i> (2 Corinthians 3:6; Romans 8:1-9), and <i>The weapons 
  of our warfare are NOT carnal</i> (2 Corinthains 10:3-6; Ephesians 6:10-17), 
  not to mention <i>THOU SHALT NOT--EVER--NOT EVER--EVER, EVER, EVER KILL!...</i>Behold,<i> 
  the LAMB </i>of God.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Suppose someone knowing absolutely nothing of the Christian 
  religion; and visiting the West for the first time, entered a cathedral complete 
  with all the sacramentals, the trappings, and the images of Christian worship...and 
  in the mysterious center of it all a large Crucifix filling up the whole space 
  behind the altar. Suppose they happened to open up a Bible and began to discover 
  in it certain stories, and certain literary types and images that were suggestive 
  of the Christian mysteries, and of the image there before them; and then suppose 
  to learn more about it they happened upon the following narrative from Proinsias 
  Mac Cana's <i>Celtic Mythology...</i></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the first century A.D., 
    Lucan mentions three deities by their Gaulish names: Cruel Teutates propitiated 
    by bloody sacrifice, and uncouth Esus of the barbarous altars, and Taranis 
    whose altar is no more benign than that of Scythian Diana...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to one of the sources 
    cited by later writers the victims of Teutates were asphyxiated by being plunged 
    headlong into a full vat, THOSE OF ESUS WERE SUSPENDED FROM TREES AND RITUALLY 
    WOUNDED, and those of Taranis were burned, numbers of them together in cages 
    of wood. Obviously these details were not invented by the commentator, but 
    one cannot be sure if he cites them in their true context.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sacrifice of Taranis echoes 
    Posidonius (as followed by Caesar and many others) who reported in the first 
    century B.C. that the Gauls burned numbers of victims in huge wicker work 
    images. The sacrifice of Esus is not clearly defined, but it may be a remnant 
    of a myth similar to that of the Germanic Odin who hung on the World Tree 
    for Nine days and Nine nights and whose victims were likewise left hanging 
    on trees...</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The account of Teutates rite recalls 
    a scene pictured on the famous Gundestrup Cauldron </font>(see Ezekiel 11:2-11)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    It has also been compared to death by drowning in a vat of mead, beer, or 
    wine which is ascribed by legend...to the story of an Irish king who is wounded, 
    the house in which he is trapped burned down around him, and he finally perishes 
    in a vat of liquor while attempting to escape the flames </font>(see 1 Thessalonians 
    5:1-7; Matthew 7:22-27)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. The fact 
    that this elaborately contrived death takes place at Samhain, the sacred festival 
    marking the end of Summer, suggests that we have to do here with a recurrent 
    mythological theme and, more specifically, with the rite related to sacred 
    kingship.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, it is to be noted 
    that these Irish narratives belong to the well known motif of the Three-fold 
    death in which the person fulfills an unlikely prophecy by suffering three 
    different deaths, in these cases by wounding, burning, and drowning </font>(see 
    2 Peter 3:5-7)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And just as Mercury-Lugh is a god 
    of warrior prowess as well as arts and crafts so the Mars of Gaulish inscriptions 
    is more than a god of war: </font>(see Isaiah 66:15,16; 2 Thessalonians 1:6-9)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    he is a god of healing, fertility, and protection, the guardian of his people 
    and of their material prosperity, whether against disease or against hostile 
    armies.&quot; </font>p.29.</p>

<p><font size="+1">...would it not all seem like the same religion? And would 
  not the activities of the modern churches, with all their tribal (nationalistic) 
  entanglements and ecclesiastical shenannigans--Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, 
  High Protestant, Baptist, and the supposedly non-demominational evangelical 
  groups--support such a conclusion? Wouldn't each of them appear to be offshoots 
  of the same Druid religion of old?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Robert Taylor, whether out of true love or disdain for the

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;No author ever displayed 
    greater powers of poetry, with equal strength of judgment, in supporting through 
    the piece the august character of the divine sufferer. The spectators themselves 
    were unconsciously made a party to the interest of the scene: its hero was 
    their friend, their benefactor, their creator, and their saviour; his wrongs 
    were incurred in their quarrel--his sorrows were endured for their salvation. 
    'He was wounded for their transgressions, and bruised for their iniquities; 
    the chastisement of their peace was upon him, and by his stripes they were 
    healed.' (Isaiah 53:5). 'He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he opened not 
    his mouth.' The majesty of his silence, whilst the ministers of an offended 
    God were nailing him by the hands and feet to Mount Caucuses, could only be 
    equaled by the modesty with which he relates, while hanging on the cross, 
    his service to the human race, which had brought on him that horrible crucifixion:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>'I will speak...See what, a god, I suffer from the gods! For mercy to 
      mankind, I am not deemed worthy of mercy;...But in this uncouth appointment, 
      am fixed here, a spectacle dishonoured by Jove!...On the throne of heaven 
      scarce was he seated...On the powers of heaven He showered His various benefits, 
      thereby confirming His sovereignty;...But for unhappy mortals had no regard, 
      but all the present race willed to extirpate, and to form anew...None save 
      myself, opposed His will...I dared, and boldly pleading, saved from the 
      destruction--saved them from sinking to the realms of Night...For which 
      offense, I bow beneath these pains...Dreadful to suffer, piteous to behold.'</b></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the catastrophe of the plot, 
    his especially professed friend, Oceanus, the Fisherman, as his name Petraeus 
    indicates (Petraeus was an interchangeable synonym of the name Oceanus), being 
    unable to prevail upon him to make his peace with Jupiter, by throwing the 
    cause of human redemption out of the cause of his (own) hands, 'forsook him 
    and fled.' None remained to be witness of his dying agonies, but the chorus 
    of ever amiable and ever faithful women, which also bewailed and lamented 
    him (Luke 23:27), but were unable to subdue his inflexible philanthropy. Overcome 
    at last by the intensity of his pains, he curses Jupiter in language hardly 
    different in terms, and but little inferior in sublimity to the 'Eloi, Eloi, 
    lama sabachtani' of the Gospel. And immediately the whole frame of Nature 
    becomes convulsed: the earth shook, the rocks rent, the graves were opened 
    (see Ezekiel 37); and in a storm that seemed to threaten the dissolution of 
    the universe, the curtain fell on the sublimest scene ever presented to the 
    contemplation of the human eye: A Dying God. </font>The Diegesis, pp.192-94<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
