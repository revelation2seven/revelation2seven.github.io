<p align="center">THREE MAIN VERSIONS FROM ONE ORIGINAL TEXT:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>From the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (about 440 BC) until the Council of Jamnia 
    (around 100 AD) there existed a &quot;Vorlage Text&quot; of the OT in Paleo-Hebrew. 
    This Vorlage was essentially the original complete Old Testament text. With 
    time, the Vorlage gave rise to three &quot;recensions&quot;. The first of 
    these was the Samaritan Pentateuch (SP), again in Paleo-Hebrew, about 408 
    BC. Tobiah the Ammonite allegedly took a copy of the Law with him when he 
    was cast out of the Temple by Nehemiah (13:4 - 9 and Ezra 4:1 - 4). And set 
    up the rival system of worship in Samaria. The SP was essentially a copy of 
    the Vorlage Pentateuch.</p>
  <p>The second recension was the Septuagint Greek (LXX) which was translated 
    from the Vorlage Text about 250 BC by 72 Jewish scholars at Alexandria. This 
    version became necessary because of the number of Greek-speaking Jews that<br>
    were resident in Egypt under the favourable Ptolemaic Dynasty. It has been 
    noted by most authorities that the LXX translation of the Vorlage Pentateuch 
    was particularly carefully done because of its revered position in the Canon.</p>
  <p>Finally, the Masoretic Hebrew Text (MT) was re-written in square &quot;modern&quot; 
    Hebrew characters at the Council of Jamnia around 100 AD, with the vowel points 
    added around 900 AD. In &quot;Our Bible and the Ancient manuscripts&quot;, 
    p.49, (Eyre and Spottiswoode, London), Sir Frederick Kenyon commented that 
    this dual procedure could easily be &quot;one considerable source of corruption&quot; 
    in the MT. But let us put this all in its proper context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">The Dead Sea Scrolls And The Council Of Jamnia.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>A very important article, that impinges on the question of the best manuscript 
    to use for dating, was written by Siegfried H. Horn, Professor Emeritus of 
    Archaeology at Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan. It appeared 
    in &quot;Ministry&quot; for November 1987, pp. 4-8, and was entitled &quot;The 
    Old Testament text in antiquity.&quot; He pointed out that the Dead Sea Scrolls 
    can be clearly divided into two groups. There are 170 manuscripts from the 
    11 Qumran caves and fragments from Masada, all of which pre-date 70 AD. The 
    second group comprises manuscripts from the desert caves in the Wadi Murabba'at, 
    the Nahal Hever, and the Nahal, Se'elim. The records show that they were hidden 
    there shortly after 100 AD.</p>
  <p>Importantly, these two groups of scrolls show two distinct text types. Those 
    pre-dating 70 AD have a text that agrees with both the LXX and the OT quotations 
    used by Christ and the Apostles in our New Testament (NT). These quotes were 
    essentially from the original Hebrew Vorlage. Those post-dating 100 AD have 
    a text virtually identical with the Masoretic Text in our present OT. The 
    dividing line between the two text types came somewhere between 70 and 100 
    AD. What happened to change the text type? Remember, the original Hebrew (Vorlage) 
    version existed from the days of Ezra and Nehemiah. The Masoretic Hebrew can 
    be traced directly to 100 AD.</p>
  <p>.As Professor horn points out, the answer is the Council of Jamnia held around 
    100 AD. He states that &quot;A unified text suddenly became the standard at 
    the end of the first century and [the fact] that not one copy of a divergent 
    text survived (except the Dead Sea scrolls that had already been hidden when 
    Jamnia convened), indicate clearly that the Council of Jamnia must have taken 
    actions in this matter.</p>
  <p>Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph was this Council's undisputed leader, though its chairman 
    was Yohannan ben Zakkai. <font size="2">(John, the son of Zachariah? No, a 
    later Yohannan, one who came in the name of the first). </font>In his later 
    years, Akiba endorsed the rebellion of Bar Kokba against Rome, and supported 
    him with his wealth, even endorsing him as the Messiah. Akiba was eventually 
    captured and taken to Rome where he was executed in 137 AD at the age of 82.</p>
  <p>The Council of Jamnia rejected the LXX and the original Hebrew on which it 
    was based (Vorlage) because, as Professor Horn points out...it had become 
    the Bible of the Christians...&quot;</p>
  <p>Indeed, as textual expert Sir Frederick Kenyon writes (op. cit. p. 56): &quot;In 
    the second century of our Era, this repudiation took form in the production 
    of a rival version.&quot; Professor Horn, Sir Frederick, and other textual 
    scholars are unanimous that this &quot;rival version&quot; was the Masoretic 
    Text, which, with some variations, has been used as the basis of most OT translations.</p>
  <p>The Council of Jamnia produced this unified text of the Old Testament and 
    ensured that all divergent texts were destroyed. <font size="2">(The original 
    texts are hidden in the Cave of Treasures). </font>This unified version, the 
    MT, was written in so-called 'modern' Hebrew with square Assyrian characters 
    instead of the ancient or Paleo-Hebrew script of the Vorlage. It was also 
    written without vowels. The vowel pointings were added about 900 AD. This 
    two-fold process (a change in Hebrew characters and vowel addition) was, as 
    Sir Frederick Kenyon concluded (op. cit. p. 49), &quot;...one considerable 
    source of corruption.&quot; Sir Frederick then went on to point out that around 
    200 AD, Origen produced his Hexapla or six-fold version of the Old Testament. 
    It had the MT in Hebrew, the MT in Greek, three other Greek versions of the 
    MT (that of Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus) and the Septuagint (LXX).</p>
  <p>Note that, except for the LXX, all 5 other versions in Origen's Hexapla were 
    simply variations on the MT. Furthermore, Sir Frederick noted that &quot;...Origen's 
    efforts were not directed towards the recovery of the original form of the 
    LXX, but at bringing it into harmony with the Masoretic Hebrew Text then current, 
    and to do this he introduced alterations into it with the utmost freedom.&quot; 
    Fortunately, in the year 617 AD Bishop Paulus of Tella in Mesopotamia made 
    a Syriac translation that detailed Origen's alterations, so that the form 
    of the original LXX was preserved for us and is today still in existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">WHAT WAS IN THE VORLAGE TEXT?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Vorlage Text is quoted in the scrolls from Qumran and Masada written 
    prior to Jamnia. After that Council, the Jews used the new MT exclusively 
    and destroyed all other versions. But Christ, the Apostles, and Josephus all 
    quote from the Vorlage and its LXX translation, as did the Church Fathers.</p>
  <p>From the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (about 440 BC) until the council of Jamnia 
    (around) 100 AD) there existed a 'Vorlage' text of the scriptures. This Vorlage 
    text in Paleo-Hebrew gave rise to the samaritan pentateuch in paleo-hebrew 
    (about 400 BC), the Septuagint Greek (about 250 BC), and the Masoretic Hebrew 
    with square 'modern' characters (about 100 AD) with vowel points added about 
    900 AD. The Vorlage text is quoted in scrolls from Qumran and Masada written 
    prior to Jamnia. After that the Jews used the Masoretic exclusively. Christ, 
    the apostles, and Josephus quote from the Vorlage as did the church fathers, 
    from their writings, it is apparent that the Septuagint text is largely correct.</p>
  <p>Shalom William &amp; Susan,<br>
    I've invited Shmuel to comment on the Vorlage, but I wanted to point you back 
    to my comment about history changing perspective. The Bet HaShem Paleo-Hebrew 
    Torah discards the Masoretic vowells and hyphenizations but otherwise retains 
    MT word forms. Though a virtual return to the Vorlage text was within the 
    technical capabilities of the BHM compiler, he decided that those changes 
    ought rather to come by concensus. The Midrash is open to ideas. <b>The BHM

<p><font size="+1">We see no corruption in the work of the rabbis in the first 
  century. Despite the reality--the fact that they could not see fully into the 
  hidden structure of the world above them--they were nevertheless commanded to 
  build a fence around the Torah, and to get inside of that fence themselves. 
  They were commanded to be guardians of the Torah so that the Law would not get 
  lost in its own universal meanings, as it accompanied both Israel and the Gentiles 
  to the ends of the age and the fulness of time. </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant 
    of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The question: From where, and when, did the Proto-Hebrew-Phoenician 
  script derive? Going directly to the hypothesis, of which we are more than confident, 
  we see that these ancient letters emerged out of Atlantean culture, and were 
  carried to the East by the Phoenicians who not only sailed freely from continent 
  to continent in those ancient times, but who also perfected these letters for 
  their own use in the realm of commerce and trade. The ancient Atlantean-Hebrew 
  adepts (the Levitical Druids), however, were also using these characters and 
  perfecting them for a different use. They were using them to compose those hidden 
  texts we know as the Torah. </font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> These texts were being composed, using those distinctly Hebrew 
  literary methods (the methods of <i>Kabbalah</i>), not in the East but in the 
  center of Europe. Grown out of all the oral traditions of the world that preceded 
  it the Torah took written form after the mind of Israel ascended back up into 
  Europe, after the time of Moses and that epic, and wholly mytho-historical event 
  called the Exodus. The mysteries of Atlantis were returning Westward.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="+1">The ancient Paleo-Hebrew script has a definite 
  connection to the shape and configuration of those Runes that have been in use 
  throughout Europe for untold centuries. Whether the Runes grew out of the Phoenician 
  script, or the Phoenician script was a perfection and alteration of the more 
  ancient Runes, others will decide. The point is that they both emerged out of 
  the same ancient Atlantean tradition:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ANCIENT RUNES</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><br>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT ARE RUNES</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the most mundane sense, runes 
    are an alphabet much as our own alphabet and others such as the Greek and 
    Cyrillic alphabets. Each rune represents a sound and was/is used to write 
    words with. But that is in the most MUNDANE of senses.<br>
    <br>
    Runes were used long before the concept of writing was around. Each rune is 
    an archetype of a force. People had concepts for such things as Fire, Honour, 
    Birth, et.al. and each of these concepts were given names to make them easier 
    for us to comprehend. In this way, runes are very similar to the Hebrew alphabet. 
    Each 'letter' not only has a sound and a name, but is a complete word with 
    all associated concepts. This similarity with Hebrew extends even farther. 
    Each hebrew word is made of several Hebrew letters, therefore each Hebrew 
    word is made of several Hebrew words. </font>(Such as the word Paradise, PRDS. 
    Psht, Rmz, Drsh, Sod)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. The initial 
    letters of several words in a sentence, or of the first letters of each sentence 
    or paragraph may be gathered to form a new word that is used to help explain 
    and expand upon what is already written. The same can be done with runes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Runes lend themselves readily to 
    numerology. The Runic alphabet is properly shown as three rows of eight letters. 
    Therefore each letter can be identified by row:column number. Additionally, 
    each rune has it's sequential number identified by it's placement in the alphabet. 
    Much like us numbering A as 1, B as 2, ... , and Z as 26.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each rune can be placed in position 
    on a tree pattern much like the traditional Qabbalah. They may represent the 
    different worlds or paths of the tree and can be expanded and expounded upon 
    as much as the Qabbalah itself is. In fact, Runic Qabbalah is quite intriguing 
    and does contain a life of study (as do all other facets of Runework). Runes 
    can be used for fortunetelling. They can be drawn and placed and read much 
    like tarot cards. The can be cast or strewn and the relationship of groupings, 
    distance and angles and patterns formed will tell the caster what he wishes 
    to know. <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Runes are also entities in and 
    of themselves. Much like the angels, princes, demons, sylphs, undines and 
    watchtowers of the ceremonial magician. Each rune can be invoked or evoked 
    and the power harnessed to work ones will to enlighten the intellect. They 
    are a fantastic meditation tool and will always increase ones knowledge. Much 
    as the primal elements of Earth, Water, Air, Fire and Spirit, each rune also 
    has it's part in the manifestation of all things manifested. Chaos, grass, 
    people, sunlight, honour, dragons, hopes, and sex are all replete with runes 
    are could not ever exist without the runic force that creates, shapes, releases, 
    destroys and changes them. I have equated runes to many other branches of 
    esoteric, occult, phsycological and intellectual pursuits. This is in the 
    hopes that if you are already familiar or interested in one of these, you 
    will realize that runes are already familiar to you or that you are already 
    interested in them and don't yet realize it.<br>
    <br>
    May you approach the Well of Wyrd and may your sip there only increase your

</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>A reader directed me to a wonderful website called &quot;Omniglot, a guide 
    to writing systems&quot;, which illustrates examples of various alphabets 
    of the world. By examining some of these we can begin to see the influences 
    which may have led to development of the Germanic/Norse rune alphabets. It 
    is commonly thought that the Etruscan and Latin alphabets were sources, but 
    as you will see below, there may have been others, also. All of the data that 
    follows are from the information and graphics from the Omniglot website.</p>
  <p>First, let's look at the major runic alphabets (called &quot;futharks&quot; 
    based upon the first six symbols). There are many other variants, but the 
    Elder, Anglo-Saxon, and Younger Futharks are the most well-known.</p>
  <p>Runes were used to write many languages including, Gothic, German, Frisian, 
    English, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Lithuanian, Russian, Hebrew 
    and other Semitic languages (due to trade relations with the Khazars, a Semitic 
    tribe of traders of the Silk Road). </p>
  <p>The runes might be read from left to right or from right to left, even on 
    the same artifact. Translation of runic inscriptions is therefore extremely 
    difficult, and complicated by the fact that rune masters sometimes wrote cryptic 
    puzzles or in secret script. </p>
  <p>THE ELDER FUTHARK</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&quot;The Elder Futhark is thought to be the oldest version of the runic 
    alphabet, and was used in the parts of Europe which were home to Germanic 
    peoples, including Scandinavia. Other versions probably developed from it. 
    The names of the letters are shown in Common Germanic, the reconstructed ancestor 
    of all Germanic languages.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Runes.gif" width="514" height="296"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>ANGLO-SAXON FUTHARK</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&quot;A number of extra letters were added to the runic alphabet to write 
    Anglo-Saxon/Old English. Runes were probably bought to Britain in the 5th 
    century by the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians (collectively known as the 
    Anglo-Saxons), and were used until about the 11th century. Runic inscriptions 
    are mostly found on jewelry, weapons, stones and other objects. Very few examples 
    of runic writing on manuscripts have survived. &quot; [The chart that follows 
    is incomplete. There are additional A-S runes, which you can see here.]</p>

  <p>YOUNGER (OR SCANDANAVIAN) FUTHARK</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&quot;This version of the runic alphabet was used sporadically in Scandinavia, 
    in particular in Denmark and Sweden, until about the 17th century .&quot; 
    [There are variants of the Younger Futhark also, which you can see here.]</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p></p>
  <p>The commonality of symbols of all of the following alphabets makes sense 
    when one considers the migration of ancient peoples from the east to the west. 
    The people and languages of northern Europe are considered &quot;Indo-European&quot; 
    because of this migration. It's not unreasonable that customs, languages, 
    alphabets, mythology, etc. share common origins. Staggering, isn't it!</p>
  <p>ETRUSCAN ALPHABETS</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&quot;The Etruscan alphabet is thought to have been developed from the Greek 
    alphabet by Greek colonists in Italy. The earliest known inscription dates 
    from the middle of the 6th century BC.</p>
  <p>More than 10,000 Etruscan inscriptions have been found on tombstones, vases, 
    statues, mirrors and jewelry. Fragments of a Etruscan book made of linen have 
    also been found.</p>
  <p>Most Etruscan inscriptions are written in horizontal lines from left to right, 
    but some are boustrophedon (running alternately left to right then right to 
    left).</p>
  <p>Used to write: Etruscan, a language spoken by the Etruscans, who lived in 
    Etruria (Tuscany and Umbria) between about the 8th century BC and the 1st 
    century AD. Little is known about the Etruscans or their language.&quot;</p>

  <p>LATIN ALPHABETS</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>&quot;The Old Italic alphabets developed from the west Greek alphabet, which 
    came to Italy via the Greek colonies on Sicily and along the west coast of 
    Italy. The Etruscans adapted the Greek alphabet to write Etruscan sometime 
    during the 6th century BC, or possibly earlier. Most of the other alphabets 
    used in Italy are thought to have derived from the Etruscan alphabet.&quot;</p>
  <p>ANCIENT LATIN</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&quot;The earliest known inscriptions in the Latin alphabet date from the 
    6th century BC. It was adapted from the Etruscan alphabet during the 7th century 
    BC. The letters Y and Z were taken from the Greek alphabet to write Greek 
    loan words. Other letters were added from time to time as the Latin alphabet 
    was adapted for other languages.&quot;</p>

  <p>ROMAN ALPHABET for LATIN</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&quot;The Romans used just 23 letters to write Latin. There were no lower 
    case letters, and K, X, Y and Z used only for writing words of Greek origin. 
    The letters J, U and W were added to the alphabet at a later stage to write 
    languages other than Latin. J is a variant of I, U is a variant of V, and 
    W was introduced as a 'double-v' to make a distinction between the sounds 
    we know as 'v' and 'w' which was unnecessary in Latin.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Hungarian runes (Sz&eacute;kely Rov&aacute;s&iacute;r&aacute;s) are 
    descended from the K&ouml;k Turki script used in Central Asia. They were used 
    by the Sz&eacute;kler Magyars in Hungary before Istv&aacute;n, the first Christian 
    king of Hungary, ordered all pre-Christian writings to be destroyed. In remote 
    parts of Transylvania however, the runes were still used up until the 1850s. 
    Hungarian runes were usually written on sticks in boustrophedon style (alternating 
    direction right to left then left to right). The runes include separate letters 
    for all the phonemes of Hungarian and are in this respect better suited to 
    written Hungarian than the Latin alphabet. &quot;</p>

  <p> The runes have been friends and travelling companions for some years now, 
    and this site would not be complete without a brief section on them. These 
    few introductory paragraphs are only the beginning of what I hope will be 
    a detailed study someday. </p>
  <p>The runes of the Elder Futhark are an ancient Norse or Teutonic system of 
    writing, and they are also oracular devices which have been in use in Europe 
    and Iceland since about 400 CE. During the period from 400 CE to 1600 CE they 
    also served as a system of communications, a way of writing and relaying information. 
    There is a wealth of runic inscriptions surviving from ancient times, including 
    many inscriptions in North America, and this lends support to historical theories 
    that it was the Vikings who really discovered North America, and that they 
    traveled widely on this continent centuries before the arrival of Columbus 
    on our shores. </p>
  <p>The word &quot;rune&quot; means variously, &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;secret 
    whisper&quot;, &quot;mystery&quot; or &quot;hidden&quot;, and it can be applied 
    to a whole group of Norse or Teutonic alphabets which were probably developed 
    for divination and magic - we know that the runes have been used for arcane 
    purposes since ancient times. Each rune has a unique pattern, an intrinsic 
    meaning and characteristics above and beyond its ordinary significance just 
    as one character in an alphabet. Singly or in groups, the runic patterns are 
    a way of unlocking and understanding the invisible or hidden realities of 
    one's existence. Each runic name is a unique term embodying philosophical 
    concepts which were of profound importance to the ancient people who first 
    used the runes. The runes represent elemental or fundamental forces of nature 
    and of the spirit; each rune with its own tale and its own association with 
    a god of the Norse or Teutonic pantheon. </p>
  <p>The mythological origin of the runes is significant, and Teutonic mythology 
    and folklore speak of the sacrifice of Odin, highest of the Aesir, to acquire 
    them. All Father Odin understood instinctively that true wisdom and second 
    sight may only be attained through sacrifice. For nine nine days and nine 
    nights he hung on the world tree (Yggdrasil), impaled on his own spear. On 
    the ninth day, a raven sent by the three Norns plucked out one of his eyes, 
    and he was transformed, seeing and taking up the runes when they were revealed 
    to him lying at the bottom of the World Tree. In so doing, he was gifted with 
    true wisdom and power. The cost of acquiring the knowledge had been enormous 
    suffering and physical death, but through the force of his will and the strength 
    of his committment, Odin was reborn, returning to life with the knowledge 
    of the Other World which the runes conveyed. Afterward, he transmitted his 
    knowledge of the runes to the goddess Freyja in return for learning the magical 
    secrets of Seithr from her. It was Hagal or Heimdall, the &quot;watcher&quot; 
    god, eternal guardian of the Rainbow Bridge, who later gifted humanity with 
    the secrets of the runes. </p>
  <p>The Elder Futhark is the oldest of the existing runic systems, and it consists 
    of twenty-four characters. The letters of the first six runes of the runic 
    alphabet, (F)eu, (U)ruz, (TH)urisaz, (A)nsu, R)aido, and (K)enaz give the 
    system its name, Futhark. A blank twenty-fifth rune called Wyrd is often used 
    today along with the runes of the Elder Futhark, but this is a fairly new 
    development. Wyrd is a name which is associated with the three Norse sisters 
    known collectively as the Norns, and individually as Urdhr (the past), Verhandi 
    (the present) and Skul (the future) The three sisters are responsible for 
    tending the world tree Yggdrasil, and they are also the weavers at the loom 
    of destiny. Together they represent the source of all knowledge and of all 
    powers of divination. On their loom, the Norns see everything which transpires 
    in the Nine Worlds, past, present and future, and with their considerable 
    vision and their formidable power, they could certainly meddle in the affairs 
    of gods and humanity, but they allow the gods and humanity to follow their 
    own paths and work out their own destinies. </p>
  <p>As the knowledge and use of the runes spread across Europe, carried by the 
    invading Teutonic tribes, other runic systems began to develop from them. 
    When the Angle, Jute and Saxon tribes invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth 
    centuries, they brought their rune system with them, and significant changes 
    occurred to the runes after they arrived in Britain. Several runes were changed 
    to fit in with the British language, specifically the runes for A/O, C/K, 
    H, J, S, and Ng, and new runes were added to represent different sounds in 
    the British tongue. The new alphabet, which was comprised of thirty-three 
    characters rather than the original twenty-four characters, was known thereafter 
    as the Anglo-Saxon Futhark. <br>
  </p>
  <p>The Origin of the Runes </p>
  <p>There has been much speculation about the origin of the runes, but the runic 
    alphabet is ancient indeed, and scholars have yet to reach an agreement about 
    where it all began. It has been speculated that the runes originated in the 
    Greek alphabet of circa 600 BCE. It has also been suggested that the runes 
    were actually derived from an early Latin alphabet. There is a theory is that 
    the runes originated in the ancient Etruscan culture of Italy, and this theory 
    was substantiated somewhat by archaeological discoveries at Negau in the early 
    nineteenth century - the remarkable bronze helmets which weree unearthed at 
    Negau bore Germanic inscriptions which had been rendered in Etruscan script, 
    and the inscriptions on the helmets are invocations to the war god Harigast. 
    There is another theory which holds that the runes evolved from the Hallristningar 
    rock pictographs carved during the later part of the Stone Age or early Bronze 
    Age in Europe. Examples of these pictographs have been discovered in Sweden, 
    Germany, Italy, Austria and other parts of mainland Europe. Whatever their 
    origin, the runes and runic folkore were an important part of the ancestral 
    inheritance of the northern Teutonic tribes who originated in the Scandinavian 
    countries and migrated southward. Like the Hebrew language, the runes were 
    written from right to left, and this would seem to indicate that the runic 
    alphabet is at least as ancient as the Hebrew language. </p>
  <p>The expansion of the runes was one result of the decline of Imperial Rome's 
    influence in Europe and the ascendancy of the Teutonic tribes. By about 410 
    CE, the Visigoths had conquered Rome and parts of Spain, and they had established 
    an empire of their own - their influence in Spain wwould endure uuntil the 
    Moorish conquests of the eighth century. By the end of the sixth century Britain 
    had been invaded by not one, but three seperate tribes, the Jutes, the Angles 
    and the Saxons, and several kingdoms existed in Britain, notably in Mercia, 
    Northumbria and Wessex. As they moved westward, the invading tribes took their 
    runes with them, and the use of the runes took hold wherever the tribes settled. 
  </p>
  <p>Early Christianity abhorred divination in general and the runes specifically. 
    The expansion of Christianity into mainland Europe seriously threatened the 
    survival of the runes in any form and for any purpose whatsoever, but they 
    managed to survive, even in the twelfth century when the Vatican decreed them 
    to be dangerous and soul destroying devices and forbade their use on pain 
    of death. The runes also survived a second papal decree in 1639, and in fact, 
    they continued in use as an alphabet right up until the nineteenth century. 
    Some Runic characters have been integrated into modern Nordic languages, but 
    from the nineteenth century on, the runes (in their entirety anyway) have 
    been in use solely as oracular devices. The last known Rune Masters or runic 
    shamans of formal affiliation were probably those in Iceland during the seventeenth 
    century. </p>
  <p>The real beginnings of the runes lie within the ancient heroic epics of the 
    Aesir and the dark and icy climes of northern Europe. Today, the seemingly 
    random fall of the stones onto the rune cloth represents the distilled essence 
    of an ancient, magical and powerful tradition.</p>

    &middot; In about 100 A.D. the roman historian Tacitus wrote in his book Germania 
    about the teutonic peoples. He tells us that the teutons used to cut BRANCHES 
    OFF FRUIT BEARING TREES, cut them into pieces and carve signs on them. These 
    pieces were spread out on a piece of cloth AND FROM THE PATTERN THEY FORMED 
    ONE COULD READ THE GODS' WILL. There is no way to know, though, if the signs 
    that they carved were runes. According to Caesar the celts too seem to have 
    used a similar divination method. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hymiskvi&eth;a in the old icelandic 
    Edda says that the gods themselves &quot;shook twigs&quot; and &quot;looked

    are mentioned on the twigs. Elsewhere too drawing of lots are mentioned when 
    decisions must be made, but that can very well be done without signs. 500 
    years after Tacitus the poet and bishop Fortunatus of Poitiers (later S:t 
    Fortunatus) wrote to a friend of his that if he wouldn't write to him with

  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The runes in scandinavian literature 
    &middot; A little later the scandinavians themselves tell us about the runes. 
    In the edda, which was written in the 13th century but is believed to have 
    been composed in the four previous centuries, the word r&uacute;n 'rune' is 
    mentioned in several places, for example in R&uacute;natal in H&aacute;vam&aacute;l 
    where we are told that &Oacute;dinn sacrificed himself to himself by hanging 
    himself pierced by a spear. He hanged in the tree Yggdrasill for nine days 
    without eating and drinking, and that way he could &quot;take up&quot; runes, 
    with which he could cure sorrows and suffering, heal wounds and cure diseases, 
    paralyse enemies and make their swords blunt and stop their arrows in their 
    flight, damp hatred, clam waves, make witches get lost, make warriors invulnerable, 
    make the dead talk, afford success in battle, knowledge and strength, awaken 
    and keep women's love, and other things. Similar qualities are ascribed to 
    the runes that the valkyrie Sigrdr&iacute;fa (Brynhildr) taught Sigur&eth;r 
    F&aacute;fnisbani in the eddic poem Sigrdr&iacute;fum&aacute;l. Here the word 
    rune can hardly mean 'letter', but must have kept its older meaning 'secret'. 
    <br>
    In a story in which Sigur&eth;r is one of the main characters - V&ouml;lsungasaga 
    - Sigur&eth;r's widdow Gu&eth;r&uacute;n carves runes on a ring to warn her 
    brothers Gunnarr and H&ouml;gni of an ambush. The messenger Vingi changed 
    the runes, and the brothers were ambushed and captured. Here rune means 'letter'.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Gesta Danorum the danish 12th 
    century historian Saxo Grammaticus writes that the ancient danes wrote down 
    the deeds of their forefathers on rocks using the letters of their own language

    Amled (whom Shakespeare called Hamlet) and says that a message from Amled's 
    uncle to the king of England was carved on wood, which he says was a very 
    common writingmaterial in ancient times (&quot;litteras ligno insculptas &#150; 
    nam id celebre quondam genus chartarum erat&quot;). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Physical remains &middot; Most 
    inscriptions that have been preserved, and those that are most known, are 
    the runic stones. They are hardly mentioned at all in the contemporary literature, 
    though, eventhough there are thousands of them, so one has to assume that 
    the old scandinavians wrote quite a lot of poems and letters on wood. For 
    a long time there was no physical evidence for this everyday rune carving, 
    but in the 50s hundreds of pieces of wood and bone with runes on them were 
    found at Bryggen in Bergen in Norway (see the MEDIEVAL RUNES page), and since 
    then pieces of wood and bone are examinated more thoroughly at archaeological 
    excavations, and lots of inscriptions on bone and wood of an everyday nature 
    have been found in other places. Birch-bark was probably a common metarial 
    for letters; in the Russian city of Novgorod, that was founded by swedish 
    viking, about 700 letters have been found, written on birch-bark, the oldest 
    from the mid 11th century, the youngest from early 15th century. All are in 
    russian, though, and none are written with runes. The shape of the runes also 
    tells us that they were created to be carved on wood. Their staffs are all 
    straight and carved either vertically or diagonally. Horisontal lines would 
    be difficult to see because of the grain of the wood, and round shapes are 
    more difficult to carve on wood than angular ones. Round shapes do occur, 
    though, on other materials. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The origin of the runes &middot; 
    The oldest runes were used in the entire germanic language area. The oldest 
    found inscription is a spear head with the name (?) &quot;raunijaR&quot; carved 
    into it. It's believed to be from the late 2nd century, and was found in &Oslash;vre 
    Stabu in southern Norway. Eventhough most other inscriptions from the following 
    centuries are also from Scandinavia, THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE RUNES WERE 
    CREATED HERE; THE ORIGIN OF THE RUNES IS SHROUDED IN FOG, AND THERE ARE LOTS 
    OF THEORIES ABOUT IT</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several of the runes can be read 
    with no certain previous knowledge, for example the r-, i- and b-runes, since 
    they look almost exactly like the corresponding roman letters. The latin alphabet 
    is one of the alphabets suggested to be the ancestor of the runic alphabet, 
    together with etrurian and greek alphabets, and others related to them (the 
    hebrew alphabet has also been suggested, and some have even claimed that the 
    other alphabets HAVE SPRUNG FROM THE RUNIC ONE). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The order of the runes is not at 
    all like the order of the latin, etrurian or greek alphabet. They all begin 
    with the letters a and b, and are therefore called alfabets (a is called alpha 
    in greek, b is called beta), whereas the runic alphabet begins with f, u, 
    &thorn;, a, r and k, and are therefore called the &quot;futhark&quot;. Eventhough 
    the 16 runes of the younger futhark where used a long time after the viking 
    age the exakt order of the 24 runes of the older futhark was forgotten, but 
    it was rediscovered in 1903 when the Kylver-stone (G88) was found on Gotland. 
    It made out one of the walls in a 5th century grave. Since then other futhark-inscriptions 
    have been found, with (almost) the same rune order. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ORIGIN OF THE RUNES 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> </p>
  <p>Scholars have yet to agree on a generic source of the Runic alphabet. Some 
    advocate that the Greek alphabet, c.600 BCE is a prototype, while others have 
    proposed that the Latin alphabet is the source, although neither claim has 
    been proven. Another theory suggests that the Runes may have originated in 
    the ancient Etruscan cultures of northern Italy. To support this theory, scholars 
    point to the discovery of 26 bronze helmets, that were found in 1812 at Negau 
    in the Austrian Empire. these helmets, dating from the 3rd century BCE have 
    a Germanic inscription engraved in the Etruscan script on them that includes 
    the words &quot;Harigast I Teiva&quot;. Translated, these words are an invocation 
    of the war-god Harigast. </p>
  <p>Other scholars propose that the Runes developed from the Hallristningar rock 
    carvings. The symbols were carved in the latter part of the Stone Age or early 
    Bronze Age and have been discovered in parts of northern Italy, Austria, and 
    southern Germany. these Runes, their pictorial symbols, and associated song 
    names and lore, were the ancestral inheritance of the North Germanic peoples 
    migrating south from Scandinavia. </p>
  <p>One historical fact is certain, that the earliest inscriptions so far found 
    were written from right to left, indicating an alphabet at least as old as 
    Hebrew language. The shape of the Runic letters, based on vertical and diagonal 
    strokes, and avoiding horizontals and curves, suggests that this was an alphabet 
    designed for carving in wood. <b>ATHENA'S ENCHANTED GROVE.</b></p>

    The Story of Mankind<br>
    by Hendrik Van Loon </p>
  <p> THE PHOENICIANS (The Atlanteans Who Gave Us Our Alphabet) </p>
  <p>THE Phoenicians, who were the neighbours of the Jews, were a Semitic tribe 
    WHICH AT A VERY EARLY AGE HAD SETTLED ALONG THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. 
    They had built themselves two well-fortified towns, Tyre and Sidon, and within 
    a short time they had gained a monopoly of the trade of the western seas. 
    Their ships went regularly to Greece and Italy and Spain and they even ventured 
    beyond the straits of Gibraltar to visit the Scilly islands where they could 
    buy tin. Wherever they went, they built themselves small trading stations, 
    which they called colonies. Many of these were the origin of modern cities, 
    such as Cadiz and Marseilles. </p>
  <p>They bought and sold whatever promised to bring them a good profit. They 
    were not troubled by a conscience. If we are to believe all their neighbours 
    they did not know what the words honesty or integrity meant. They regarded 
    a well-filled treasure chest the highest ideal of all good citizens. Indeed 
    they were very unpleasant people and did not have a single friend. Nevertheless 
    they have rendered all coming generations one service of the greatest possible 
    value. They gave us our alphabet...</p>
  <p>(Van Loon has traced the Phoenician alphabet from the East. We have turned 
    it the other way around. The Phoenicians brought it into the Meditteranean 
    area with them. Nevertheless)...</p>
  <p>In due course of time, this alphabet travelled across the AEgean Sea and 
    entered Greece. The Greeks added a few letters of their own and carried the 
    improved system to Italy. The Romans modified the figures somewhat and in 
    turn taught them to the wild barbarians of western Europe. Those wild barbarians 
    were our own ancestors, and that is the reason why this book is written in 
    characters that are of Phoenician origin and not in the hieroglyphics of the 
    Egyptians or in the nail-script of the Sumerians. </p>

    Babel, a New Capital for a Wider Continent<br>
    By ALAN RIDING<br>
    <br>
    PARIS &#151; One lesson offered by the Book of Genesis is that when &quot;the 
    whole earth was of one language and of one speech,&quot; things got done. 
    And when the Lord disapproved of the grandiosity of the resulting Tower of 
    Babel, his way of scattering those engaged in the project was to &quot;confound 
    their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.&quot;</p>
  <p>Now, with 10 new members adding 9 languages to the European Union's existing 
    11, Babel is back in the headlines. Would the 25-nation bloc be more effective 
    working in &quot;one speech,&quot; or at least only in its three principal 
    languages - English, French and German? Will the need to turn millions of 
    documents and thousands of voices into 20 languages become a Babelian impediment 
    to getting things done? </p>
  <p>In Brussels, these questions are not welcome. The problem of managing a cacophony 
    of tongues is thought far less daunting than having to silence any individual 
    language. After all, if Dutch, Greek and Danish are used, why not Estonian, 
    Hungarian and Maltese? The 191-member United Nations may tick along just fine 
    with six languages, but in Europe the right of officials and legislators to 
    work in their own languages is now enshrined as a democratic imperative.</p>
  <p>As the union's executive commission puts it: &quot;The citizens of Europe 
    should not have to be represented in Brussels by their best linguists - they 
    can send their best experts.&quot;</p>
  <p>Anticipating the union's enlargement this weekend, officials have scrambled 
    to find translators and interpreters able to work in the new languages. The 
    number of language combinations for interpretation - Hungarian to Latvian, 
    for example - will jump to 380 from 110, although in practice &quot;relay 
    languages&quot; like English and French will serve many people as a bridge 
    between less-spoken languages.</p>
  <p>As for the extra expense, European officials respond that the union's linguistic 
    services cost less than 1 percent of the total budget, or just $2.40 (2 euros) 
    per citizen per year - the equivalent of a cup of coffee. &quot;It is a small 
    price for insuring that everyone has a right to communicate with, and hear 
    from, those institutions in their own language,&quot; says Neil Kinnock, the 
    commission's vice president.</p>
  <p>So linguistic democracy has won out. Or has it? In reality, a different - 
    less legalistic, more intense - battle is also taking place over what languages 
    European officials and politicians actually use to talk to one another and 
    to reach a wider public. And here the outcome is different. &quot;In this 
    context, the enlarged Europe will not be Babel,&quot; Le Monde's Arnaud Leparmentier 
    wrote recently. &quot;It has found the gift of tongues: it is English.&quot;</p>
  <p>It was not always like this. As the traditional tool of diplomacy, French 
    long dominated European affairs. But after Sweden, Finland and Austria joined 
    the European Union in 1995, the balance began to tip toward English. Now, 
    with a fresh enlargement, English is increasingly preferred over French.</p>
  <p>The adoption of English as everyone's second language is of course a global 
    phenomenon. But a look at language teaching in Europe also explains why French 
    and German officials often communicate in English. While more than 90 percent 
    of high school students in Europe are learning English, French is studied 
    by only 29 percent in Germany, 27 percent in Italy and 24 percent in Spain. 
    German is studied by only 31 percent in France, 8 percent in Italy and 1 percent 
    in Spain (Central Europe is the exception).</p>
  <p>Thus, having a voice in Europe - tiny like Latvia or powerful like Germany 
    - does not automatically mean that a country's language will be more widely 
    studied or spoken. A language's use in Brussels may improve public perceptions 
    of the European Union, but this acceptance is more likely to influence how 
    a country sees itself than how it is viewed by others. </p>
  <p>A larger question looms over Europe's minority languages, which are spoken 
    by some 40 million people, about 8 percent of the region's population. While, 
    say, Fresian in the Netherlands and Sami in Finland reinforce cultural identities, 
    many such languages are struggling to survive. Often rooted in rural areas 
    and spoken by older people, they have been weakened by migration to cities 
    and the exposure of younger generations to national media.</p>
  <p>Governments intent on defending national languages often deem regional tongues 
    costly nuisances. They probably deserve better. Even more than the European 
    Union's 20 official languages, they offer sparkling evidence of Europe's cultural 
    diversity. </p>
