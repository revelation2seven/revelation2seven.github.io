<p align="center">Liberty? How Long?<br>
  Liberty of Conscience Threatened<br>
</p>
<p>Introduction<br>
  These are eventful times. With history-making changes passing rapidly before 
  our eyes, questions press upon thoughtful minds in all lands. Whgat do these 
  things mean? What is next in the program of world-shaping events? In this &quot;Historical 
  Series&quot; we may see a foreshadowing of the conflict before us. The great 
  events which have marked the progress of reform in past ages are matters of 
  history, history that may soon be repeated.</p>
<p>Romanism is now regarded by Protestants with far greater favor than in former 
  years. In those countries where Catholicism is not in the ascendancy, and the 
  papists are taking a conciliatory course in order to gain influence, there is 
  an increasing indifference concerning the doctrines that separate the reformed 
  churches from the papal hierarchy; the opinion is gaining ground that, after 
  all, we do not differ so widely upon vital points as has been supposed, and 
  that a little concession on our part will bring us into a better understanding 
  with Rome. The time was when Protestants placed a high value upon the liberty 
  of conscience which had been so dearly purchased. They taught their children 
  to abhor popery and held that to seek harmony with Rome would be disloyalty 
  to God. But how widely different are the sentiments now expressed!</p>
<p>The defenders of the papacy declare that the church has been maligned, and 
  the Protestant world are inclined to accept the statement. Many urge that it 
  is unjust to judge the church of today by the abominations and absurdities that 
  marked her reign during the centuries of ignorance and darkness. They excuse 
  her horrible cruelty as the result of the barbarism of the times and plead that 
  the influence of modern civilization has changed her sentiments.</p>
<p>Claim of Infallibility<br>
  Have these persons forgotten the claim of infallibility put forth for eight 
  hundred years by this haughty power? So far from being relinquished, this claim 
  was affirmed in the nineteenth century with greater positiveness than ever before. 
  As Rome asserts that the &quot;church never erred; nor will it, according to 
  the Scriptures, ever err &quot; (John L. von Mosheim, Institutes of Ecclesiastical 
  History, book 3, century II, part 2, chapter 2, section 9, note 17), how can 
  she renounce the principles which governed her course in past ages?</p>
<p>The papal church will never relinquish her claim to infallibility. All that 
  she has done in her persecution of those who reject her dogmas she holds to 
  be right; and would she not repeat the same acts, should the opportunity be 
  presented? Let the restraints now imposed by secular governments be removed 
  and Rome be reinstated in her former power, and there would speedily be a revival 
  of her tyranny and persecution.</p>
<p>Catholocism Versus Freedom of Conscience<br>
  A well-known writer speaks thus of the attitude of the papal hierarchy as regards 
  freedom of conscience, and of the perils which especially threaten the United 
  States from the success of her policy:</p>
<p>&quot;There are many who are disposed to attribute any fear of Roman Catholicism 
  in the United States to bigotry or childishness. Such see nothing in the character 
  and attitude of Romanism that is hostile to our free institutions, or find nothing 
  portentous in its growth. Let us, then, first compare some of the fundamental 
  principles of our government with those of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>&quot;The Constitution of the United States guarantees liberty of conscience 
  . Nothing is dearer or more fundamental. Pope Pius IX, in his Encyclical Letter 
  of August 15, 1854, said: `The absurd and erroneous doctrines or ravings in 
  defense of liberty of conscience are a most pestilential error--a pest, of all 
  others, most to be dreaded in a state.' The same pope, in his Encyclical Letter 
  of December 8, 1864, anathematized `those who assert the liberty of conscience 
  and of religious worship,' also 'all such as maintain that the church may not 
  employ force.' [see note below on paragraph 8.]</p>
<p>&quot;The pacific tone of Rome in the United States does not imply a change 
  of heart. She is tolerant where she is helpless. Says Bishop O'Connor: 'Religious 
  liberty is merely endured until the opposite can be carried into effect without 
  peril to the Catholic world.'. . . The archbishop of St. Louis once said: 'Heresy 
  and unbelief are crimes; and in Christian countries, as in Italy and Spain, 
  for instance, where all the people are Catholics, and where the Catholic religion 
  is an essential part of the law of the land, they are punished as other crimes.'. 
  . .</p>
<p>&quot;Every cardinal, archbishop, and bishop in the Catholic Church takes an 
  oath of allegiance to the pope, in which occur the following words: 'Heretics, 
  schismatics, and rebels to our said lord (the pope), or his aforesaid successors, 
  I will to my utmost persecute and oppose.'&quot;--Josiah Strong, Our Country, 
  ch. 5, pars. 2-4. [See note below on paragraph 10.]</p>
<p>Many Real Christians in Catholocism<br>
  It is true that there are real Christians in the Roman Catholic communion. Thousands 
  in that church are serving God according to the best light they have. They are 
  not allowed access to His word, and therefore they do not discern the truth.[* 
  Published in 1888 and 1911. See Appendix.] They have never seen the contrast 
  between a living heart service and a round of mere forms and ceremonies. God 
  looks with pitying tenderness upon these souls, educated as they are in a faith 
  that is delusive and unsatisfying. He will cause rays of light to penetrate 
  the dense darkness that surrounds them. He will reveal to them the truth as 
  it is in Jesus, and many will yet take their position with His people.</p>
<p>Roman System Conflicts with the Gospel<br>
  But Romanism as a system is no more in harmony with the gospel of Christ now 
  than at any former period in her history. The Protestant churches are in great 
  darkness, or they would discern the signs of the times. The Roman Church is 
  far-reaching in her plans and modes of operation. She is employing every device 
  to extend her influence and increase her power in preparation for a fierce and 
  determined conflict to regain control of the world, to re-establish persecution, 
  and to undo all that Protestantism has done. Catholicism is gaining ground upon 
  every side. See the increasing number of her churches and chapels in Protestant 
  countries. Look at the popularity of her colleges and seminaries in America, 
  so widely patronized by Protestants. Look at the growth of ritualism in England 
  and the frequent defections to the ranks of the Catholics. These things should 
  awaken the anxiety of all who prize the pure principles of the gospel.</p>
<p>Protestants have tampered with and patronized popery; they have made compromises 
  and concessions which papists themselves are surprised to see and fail to understand. 
  Men are closing their eyes to the real character of Romanism and the dangers 
  to be apprehended from her supremacy. The people need to be aroused to resist 
  the advances of this most dangerous foe to civil and religious liberty.</p>
<p>Many Protestants suppose that the Catholic religion is unattractive and that 
  its worship is a dull, meaningless round of ceremony. Here they mistake. While 
  Romanism is based upon deception, it is not a coarse and clumsy imposture. The 
  religious service of the Roman Church is a most impressive ceremonial. Its gorgeous 
  display and solemn rites fascinate the senses of the people and silence the 
  voice of reason and of conscience. The eye is charmed. Magnificent churches, 
  imposing processions, golden altars, jeweled shrines, choice paintings, and 
  exquisite sculpture appeal to the love of beauty. The ear also is captivated. 
  The music is unsurpassed. The rich notes of the deep-toned organ, blending with 
  the melody of many voices as it swells through the lofty domes and pillared 
  aisles of her grand cathedrals, cannot fail to impress the mind with awe and 
  reverence.</p>
<p>This outward splendor, pomp, and ceremony, that only mocks the longings of 
  the sin-sick soul, is an evidence of inward corruption. The religion of Christ 
  needs not such attractions to recommend it. In the light shining from the cross, 
  true Christianity appears so pure and lovely that no external decorations can 
  enhance its true worth. It is the beauty of holiness, a meek and quiet spirit, 
  which is of value with God.</p>
<p>Brilliancy of style is not necessarily an index of pure, elevated thought. 
  High conceptions of art, delicate refinement of taste, often exist in minds 
  that are earthly and sensual. They are often employed by Satan to lead men to 
  forget the necessities of the soul, to lose sight of the future, immortal life, 
  to turn away from their infinite Helper, and to live for this world alone.</p>
<p>A religion of externals is attractive to the unrenewed heart. The pomp and 
  ceremony of the Catholic worship has a seductive, bewitching power, by which 
  many are deceived; and they come to look upon the Roman Church as the very gate 
  of heaven. None but those who have planted their feet firmly upon the foundation 
  of truth, and whose hearts are renewed by the Spirit of God, are proof against 
  her influence. Thousands who have not an experimental knowledge of Christ will 
  be led to accept the forms of godliness without the power. Such a religion is 
  just what the multitudes desire.</p>
<p>A Claimed Right to Pardon Sin<br>
  The church's claim to the right to pardon leads the Romanist to feel at liberty 
  to sin; and the ordinance of confession, without which her pardon is not granted, 
  tends also to give license to evil. He who kneels before fallen man, and opens 
  in confession the secret thoughts and imaginations of his heart, is debasing 
  his manhood and degrading every noble instinct of his soul. In unfolding the 
  sins of his life to a priest,--an erring, sinful mortal, and too often corrupted 
  with wine and licentiousness,--his standard of character is lowered, and he 
  is defiled in consequence. His thought of God is degraded to the likeness of 
  fallen humanity, for the priest stands as a representative of God. This degrading 
  confession of man to man is the secret spring from which has flowed much of 
  the evil that is defiling the world and fitting it for the final destruction. 
  Yet to him who loves self-indulgence, it is more pleasing to confess to a fellow 
  mortal than to open the soul to God. It is more palatable to human nature to 
  do penance than to renounce sin; it is easier to mortify the flesh by sackcloth 
  and nettles and galling chains than to crucify fleshly lusts. Heavy is the yoke 
  which the carnal heart is willing to bear rather than bow to the yoke of Christ.</p>
<p>There is a striking similarity between the Church of Rome and the Jewish Church 
  at the time of Christ's first advent. While the Jews secretly trampled upon 
  every principle of the law of God, they were outwardly rigorous in the observance 
  of its precepts, loading it down with exactions and traditions that made obedience 
  painful and burdensome. As the Jews professed to revere the law, so do Romanists 
  claim to reverence the cross. They exalt the symbol of Christ's sufferings, 
  while in their lives they deny Him whom it represents.</p>
<p>Papists place crosses upon their churches, upon their altars, and upon their 
  garments. Everywhere is seen the insignia of the cross. Everywhere it is outwardly 
  honored and exalted. But the teachings of Christ are buried beneath a mass of 
  senseless traditions, false interpretations, and rigorous exactions. The Saviour's 
  words concerning the bigoted Jews, apply with still greater force to the leaders 
  of the Roman Catholic Church: &quot;They bind heavy burdens and grievous to 
  be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move 
  them with one of their fingers.&quot; Matthew 23:4. Conscientious souls are 
  kept in constant terror fearing the wrath of an offended God, while many of 
  the dignitaries of the church are living in luxury and sensual pleasure.</p>
<p>The worship of images and relics, the invocation of saints, and the exaltation 
  of the pope are devices of Satan to attract the minds of the people from God 
  and from His Son. To accomplish their ruin, he endeavors to turn their attention 
  from Him through whom alone they can find salvation. He will direct them to 
  any object that can be substituted for the One who has said: &quot;Come unto 
  Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.&quot; Matthew 
  11:28.</p>
<p>Inquisition Cruelty Inspired by Satan<br>
  It is Satan's constant effort to misrepresent the character of God, the nature 
  of sin, and the real issues at stake in the great controversy. His sophistry 
  lessens the obligation of the divine law and gives men license to sin. At the 
  same time he causes them to cherish false conceptions of God so that they regard 
  Him with fear and hate rather than with love. The cruelty inherent in his own 
  character is attributed to the Creator; it is embodied in systems of religion 
  and expressed in modes of worship. Thus the minds of men are blinded, and Satan 
  secures them as his agents to war against God. By perverted conceptions of the 
  divine attributes, heathen nations were led to believe human sacrifices necessary 
  to secure the favor of Deity; and horrible cruelties have been perpetrated under 
  the various forms of idolatry.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church, uniting the forms of paganism and Christianity, 
  and, like paganism, misrepresenting the character of God, had resorted to practices 
  no less cruel and revolting. In the days of Rome's supremacy there were instruments 
  of torture to compel assent to her doctrines. There was the stake for those 
  who would not concede to her claims. There were massacres on a scale that will 
  never be known until revealed in the judgment. Dignitaries of the church studied, 
  under Satan their master, to invent means to cause the greatest possible torture 
  and not end the life of the victim. In many cases the infernal process was repeated 
  to the utmost limit of human endurance, until nature gave up the struggle, and 
  the sufferer hailed death as a sweet release.</p>
<p>Such was the fate of Rome's opponents. For her adherents she had the discipline 
  of the scourge, of famishing hunger, of bodily austerities in every conceivable, 
  heart-sickening form. To secure the favor of Heaven, penitents violated the 
  laws of God by violating the laws of nature. They were taught to sunder the 
  ties which He has formed to bless and gladden man's earthly sojourn. The churchyard 
  contains millions of victims who spent their lives in vain endeavors to subdue 
  their natural affections, to repress, as offensive to God, every thought and 
  feeling of sympathy with their fellow creatures.</p>
<p>If we desire to understand the determined cruelty of Satan, manifested for 
  hundreds of years, not among those who never heard of God, but in the very heart 
  and throughout the extent of Christendom, we have only to look at the history 
  of Romanism. Through this mammoth system of deception the prince of evil achieves 
  his purpose of bringing dishonor to God and wretchedness to man. And as we see 
  how he succeeds in disguising himself and accomplishing his work through the 
  leaders of the church, we may better understand why he has so great antipathy 
  to the Bible. If that Book is read, the mercy and love of God will be revealed; 
  it will be seen that He lays upon men none of these heavy burdens. All that 
  He asks is a broken and contrite heart, a humble, obedient spirit.</p>
<p>Christ's Teaching Versus That of Catholocism<br>
  Christ gives no example in His life for men and women to shut themselves in 
  monasteries in order to become fitted for heaven. He has never taught that love 
  and sympathy must be repressed. The Saviour's heart overflowed with love. The 
  nearer man approaches to moral perfection, the keener are his sensibilities, 
  the more acute is his perception of sin, and the deeper his sympathy for the 
  afflicted. The pope claims to be the vicar of Christ; but how does his character 
  bear comparison with that of our Saviour? Was Christ ever known to consign men 
  to the prison or the rack because they did not pay Him homage as the King of 
  heaven? Was His voice heard condemning to death those who did not accept Him? 
  When He was slighted by the people of a Samaritan village, the apostle John 
  was filled with indignation, and inquired: &quot;Lord, wilt Thou that we command 
  fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?&quot; Jesus 
  looked with pity upon His disciple, and rebuked his harsh spirit, saying: &quot;The 
  Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.&quot; Luke 
  9:54, 56. How different from the spirit manifested by Christ is that of His 
  professed vicar.</p>
<p>Fair Front Now But Principles Unchanged<br>
  The Roman Church now presents a fair front to the world, covering with apologies 
  her record of horrible cruelties. She has clothed herself in Christlike garments; 
  but she is unchanged. Every principle of the papacy that existed in past ages 
  exists today. The doctrines devised in the darkest ages are still held. Let 
  none deceive themselves. The papacy that Protestants are now so ready to honor 
  is the same that ruled the world in the days of the Reformation, when men of 
  God stood up, at the peril of their lives, to expose her iniquity. She possesses 
  the same pride and arrogant assumption that lorded it over kings and princes, 
  and claimed the prerogatives of God. Her spirit is no less cruel and despotic 
  now than when she crushed out human liberty and slew the saints of the Most 
  High.</p>
<p>The papacy is just what prophecy declared that she would be, the apostasy of 
  the latter times. 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4. It is a part of her policy to assume 
  the character which will best accomplish her purpose; but beneath the variable 
  appearance of the chameleon she conceals the invariable venom of the serpent. 
  &quot;Faith ought not to be kept with heretics, nor persons suspected of heresy&quot; 
  (Lenfant, volume 1, page 516), she declares. Shall this power, whose record 
  for a thousand years is written in the blood of the saints, be now acknowledged 
  as a part of the church of Christ?</p>
<p>Protestantism Has Degenerated<br>
  It is not without reason that the claim has been put forth in Protestant countries 
  that Catholicism differs less widely from Protestantism than in former times. 
  There has been a change; but the change is not in the papacy. Catholicism indeed 
  resembles much of the Protestantism that now exists, because Protestantism has 
  so greatly degenerated since the days of the Reformers.</p>
<p>As the Protestants churches have been seeking the favor of the world, false 
  charity has blinded their eyes. They do not see but that it is right to believe 
  good of all evil, and as the inevitable result they will finally believe evil 
  of all good. Instead of standing in defense of the faith once delivered to the 
  saints, they are now, as it were, apologizing to Rome for their uncharitable 
  opinion of her, begging pardon for their bigotry.</p>
<p>A large class, even of those who look upon Romanism with no favor, apprehend 
  little danger from her power and influence. Many urge that the intellectual 
  and moral darkness prevailing during the Middle Ages favored the spread of her 
  dogmas, superstitions, and oppression, and that the greater intelligence of 
  modern times, the general diffusion of knowledge, and the increasing liberality 
  in matters of religion forbid a revival of intolerance and tyranny. The very 
  thought that such a state of things will exist in this enlightened age is ridiculed. 
  It is true that great light, intellectual, moral, and religious, is shining 
  upon this generation. In the open pages of God's Holy Word, light from heaven 
  has been shed upon the world. But it should be remembered that the greater the 
  light bestowed, the greater the darkness of those who pervert and reject it.</p>
<p>A prayerful study of the Bible would show Protestants the real character of 
  the papacy and would cause them to abhor and to shun it; but many are so wise 
  in their own conceit that they feel no need of humbly seeking God that they 
  may be led into the truth. Although priding themselves on their enlightenment, 
  they are ignorant both of the Scriptures and of the power of God. They must 
  have some means of quieting their consciences, and they seek that which is least 
  spiritual and humiliating. What they desire is a method of forgetting God which 
  shall pass as a method of remembering Him. The papacy is well adapted to meet 
  the wants of all these. It is prepared for two classes of mankind, embracing 
  nearly the whole world--those who would be saved by their merits, and those 
  who would be saved in their sins. Here is the secret of its power.</p>
<p>Note regarding paragraph 8:</p>
<p>QUOTATIONS FROM JOSIAH STRONG.--In his first edition of Our Country, Josiah 
  Strong, without access to primary sources, incorrectly referenced the statements 
  attributed to Pope Pius IX.</p>
<p>The correct reference for the first citation is Pope Gregory XVI's encyclical 
  letter of August 15, 1832 &quot;Marari Vos&quot;. The relevant paragraph is 
  here quoted in full:</p>
<p>14. This shameful font of indifferentism gives rise to that absurd and erroneous 
  proposition which claims that liberty of conscience must be maintained for everyone. 
  It spreads ruin in sacred and civil affairs, though some repeat over and over 
  again with the greatest impudence that some advantage accrues to religion from 
  it. &quot;But the death of the soul is worse than freedom of error,&quot; as 
  Augustine was wont to say.21 When all restraints are removed by which men are 
  kept on the narrow path of truth, their nature, which is already inclined to 
  evil, propels them to ruin. Then truly &quot;the bottomless pit&quot;22 is opened 
  from which John saw smoke ascending which obscured the sun, and out of which 
  locusts flew forth to devastate the earth. Thence comes transformation of minds, 
  corruption of youths, contempt of sacred things and holy laws--in other words, 
  a pestilence more deadly to the state than any other. Experience shows, even 
  from earliest times, that cities renowned for wealth, dominion, and glory perished 
  as a result of this single evil, namely immoderate freedom of opinion, license 
  of free speech, and desire for novelty. --As printed in Claudia Carlen, IHM, 
  The Papal Encyclicals, 1740-1878 (Ann Arbor, Michigan: The Pierian Press, 1990), 
  vol. 1, p. 238.</p>
<p>The second citation should be credited to Pope Pius IX's Syllabus of Errors, 
  which accompanied his encyclical letter of December 8, 1864. Included among 
  the 80 errors anathematized are: </p>
<p>24. The Church has not the power of using force, nor has she any temporal power, 
  direct or indirect.--Apostolic Letter &quot;Ad Apostolicae,&quot; Aug. 22, 1851.</p>
<p>78. Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that 
  persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own 
  peculiar worship.--Allocution &quot;Acerbissimum,&quot; Sept. 27, 1852.</p>
<p>79. Moreover, it is false that the civil liberty of every form of worship, 
  and the full power, given to all, of overtly and publicly manifesting any opinions 
  whatsoever and thoughts, conduce more easily to corrupt the morals and minds 
  of the people, and to propagate the pest of indifferentism.--Allocution &quot;Nunquam 
  fore,&quot; Dec. 15, 1856. --As printed in Anne Fremantle, ed., The Papal Encyclicals 
  in Their Historical Context (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1956), pp. 146, 
  152.</p>
<p>Note regarding paragraph 10:</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the oath of allegiance to the pope, quoted in 
  the last paragraph of the citation from Strong, was the bishop's oath, not one 
  taken by cardinals.</p>
<p>Note regarding the above citation errors:</p>
<p>The errors corrected by the notes above were unfortunately not found until 
  after at least two editions of Born Free had been printed.</p>
