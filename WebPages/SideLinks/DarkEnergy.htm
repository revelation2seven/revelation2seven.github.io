    <p><font size="+1">Discovered only five years ago, this bizarre form of energy 
      makes up 73 percent of the mass of the universe, astronomers say. Ordinary 
      matter, the stuff of planets, trees, people and mosquitos, accounts for 
      only 4 percent. The remaining 23 percent is Dark Matter, GHOSTLY PARTICLES 
      THAT ARE PRESUMED TO EXIST, BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN SEEN...</font></p>

      1:18-20; Ephesians 1:17-23...KJV).</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">THE DETECTION OF DARK ENERGY IS SHAKING THE FOUNDATIONS 
      OF THE STANDARD DESCRIPTION OF THE UNIVERSE. Solving the puzzle has become 
      a top priority of astronomers and physicists. </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">&quot;WE DON'T KNOW WHAT DARK ENERGY IS,&quot; said Sean 
      Carroll, a physicist at the University of Chicago. &quot;It's a weird, crazy-sounding 
      idea. But you have to deal with it. This is the Universe where we live.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">For centuries, the universe was thought to be dominated 
      by gravity, the fundamental force of nature that pulls objects toward one 
      another. The recent findings, however, reveal A CONTRARY FORCE, sometimes 
      called &quot;negative gravity&quot; that repels objects rather than attracts 
      them. The revelation came last year when two telescopes--one floating a 
      million miles out in space, the other at Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, 
      New Mexico--independently confirmed that THIS STRANGE FORCE IS CAUSING THE 
      UNIVERSE TO EXPAND AT AN ACCELERATING RATE.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Several more high-level science projects are underway or 
      in the planning process TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE AND NATURE OF DARK ENERGY. 
      A joint Canadian-French-American telescope on Hawaii's Maune Kea has begun 
      &quot;AN ULTRA-DEEP SURVEY&quot; of the brilliant exploding stars known 
      as supernovae, which are a key to unlocking Dark Energy's secrets.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">NASA and the Department of Energy are seeking proposals 
      for a JOINT DARK ENERGY MISSION TO BE LAUNCHED INTO SPACE sometime after 
      2010. A special telescope would discover and measure the distance to thousands 
      of supernovae, far more than can be studied now. NASA is considering a separate 
      DARK UNIVERSE OBSERVATORY consisting of A FLEET OF SEVEN X-RAY TELESCOPES 
      to be launched in 2008 TO INVESTIGATE DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER...</font></p>

    <p><font size="+1">Starting in 2011, a proposed ground-based project, THE 
      LARGE SYNOPTIC SURVEY TELESCOPE, would use a 27-foot mirror to make three-dimensional 
      maps of clusters of galaxies up to 8-billion years old...</font></p>

      ye, BEING ROOTED AND GROUNDED IN LOVE;</font></i></p>

      that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ephesians 
      3:17-19).</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">...Charting the movements of these clusters over time should 
      tell researchers HOW DARK ENERGY IS TEARING THEM APART.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">It was supernovae that provided the first evidence of Dark 
      Energy in 1998. Accurate measurements of the distances to these emote beacons 
      upset the prevailing view that the force of gravity must be slowing the 
      rate at which the universe has been expanding since its birth about 14 billion 
      years ago. Instead of decelerating, the expansion rate began to speed up 
      about 6 billion years ago and continues to do so, the supernovae observations 
      showed. Scientists concluded that AN UNKNOWN FORCE MUST BE ACTING LIKE A 
      COSMIC ACCELERATOR, overwhelming the braking action of normal gravity.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">&quot;Dark Energy is driving the acceleration,&quot; said 
      Alan Guth, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 
      Cambridge. &quot;But we really have no understanding of this.&quot; Michael 
      Turner, the chairman of the Department of Astro-physics at the University 
      of Chicago called cosmic-acceleration &quot;one of the most important discoveries 
      in all science.&quot; Its discovery sent astronomers rushing to observe 
      more such phenomena and cosmologists to conjuring up explanations for it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">The leading guess about the nature of Dark Energy comes 
      from modern quantum physics. This is a branch of science, almost incomprehensible 
      to laymen, that says there is no such thing as a perfect vacuum. WHAT APPEARS 
      TO BE EMPTY SPACE IS FILLED WITH GHOSTLY PARTICLES THAT POP IN AND OUT OF 
      EXISTENCE.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">In Turner's words, &quot;space is a simmering Sea of Particles 
      living on borrowed time and borrowed energy.&quot; Said Carroll, &quot;You 
      can't turn off the jiggling.&quot;...</font></p>

    <p><font size="+1">THIS INVISIBLE SEA OF PARTICLES exerts a negative pressure 
      that makes objects repel rather than attract, one another, quantum physicists 
      say. Albert Einstein first proposed such a force to explain why the universe 
      isn't collapsing on itself. Einstein called it a &quot;cosmological constant.&quot; 
      He later repudiated the concept, but it's back in fashion, RELABLED AS DARK 
      ENERGY AND CHALLENGING SCIENTISTS TO MAKE SENSE OF IT. </font></p>
