<blockquote>
<p><b>&#147;America has the grandest trees on earth -- the largest, the oldest, 
    and, we think, the most beautiful. From the earliest days of our nation, vast 
    forests greeted immigrants from around the world. These were the seemingly 
    limitless stands of trees, of an incredible diversity and size, that Native 
    Americans have known so well for untold centuries. America's forests made 
    possible the building of our great nation. Whether they provided food and 
    shelter, or the more intangible ingredients around which a culture was formed, 
    trees were essential to our growth. And today, we rely on trees for a vast 
    array of wood products, and for so much more. Trees cool our cities, clean 
    our water, and anchor our soil. And trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
    while producing the oxygen we breathe. </b></p>
  <p><b>Trees are also a vital link between us and the natural world, a comforting 
    part of our daily lives, and an intimate connection with the countless other 
    living things with which we share the good earth.</b></p>
  <p><b>From among such a wealth of trees, the American people have done well 
    to select one as a symbol of all our magnificent trees. And in taking part 
    in this process, they have also learned the importance of caring for trees, 
    and the need to plant the right tree in the right place . . . of selecting 
    well from the vast diversity of trees which is our great gift.&#148;</b></p>

    at the national tree unveiling ceremony, Washington, D.C. </b></p>

  <p><b>On a perfect spring day, surrounded by tree stewards, statesmen and friends, 
    and shaded by grand and glorious trees on the U.S. Capitol grounds, a young 
    oak tree was planted. </b></p>
  <p><b>This ceremonial planting took place at the unveiling of the tree chosen 
    by a vote of the American people to select a tree that most suitably represents 
    the spirit of America, and of its people.</b></p>
  <p><b>It was National Arbor Day &#151; Friday, April. 27, 2001 &#151; and with 
    a four-month voting process that ended at midnight the night before, the American 
    people had chosen a National Tree &#151; the Oak.</b></p>
  <p><b>Sen. Ben Nelson and Congressman Bob Goodlatte announced at the ceremony 
    that they will introduce legislation to make the oak the congressionally designated 
    National Tree. </b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Good Ideas for a Great Arbor Day Celebration:</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&#149; Raise the flag, strike up the band, make Arbor Day fun. Make it 
    memorable. Organize a fun run. Make it a real event. See if a local business 
    will donate prizes. Have a poster contest, or a poetry contest. Get the local 
    PTA to sponsor a children's pageant or play. Check out the Arbor Day Play, 
    where the statue of J. Sterling Morton comes to life to tell the children 
    how he &quot;authored&quot; this special holiday. Organize and train volunteers 
    to help you carry out Arbor Day ceremonies in your schools.</b></p>
  <p><b>&#149; Get people excited. Show them things they've never seen before. 
    Tell them things about trees they've never heard. </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg481-482.gif" width="750" height="650"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&#149; Fill the air with music. Have an Arbor Day concert of songs about 
    trees, or with tree names in their titles.</b></p>
  <p><b>&#149; Get people into action. Ask a civic or service group to promote 
    a paper drive to gather paper to be recycled and save a tree. Use the proceeds 
    to buy a special tree to plant in a park or other special public place. Ask 
    a local radio station to sponsor a tree trivia contest and give away trees 
    to winners. Conduct a tree search. Ask people to find large, unusual or historic 
    trees in your community. Tell people to take a hike--a tree identification 
    hike--and have girl scouts or boy scouts act as guides.<br>
    <br>
    &#149; Dedicate a forest, or a tree, or a flower bed in a park, and make it 
    an occasion to talk about stewardship. Get a local nursery or garden center 
    to hold an open house or field day. Organize an Arbor Day Fair.</b></p>
  <p><b>&#149; Get people together. Encourage neighborhood organizations to hold 
    block parties and get their members to adopt and care for street trees in 
    front of their homes. Pass out buttons. Give away trees.</b></p>
  <p><b>&#149; Celebrate Arbor Day in a personal way by planting a tree yourself. 
    It is an act of optimism and kindness, a labor of love and a commitment to 
    stewardship.</b></p>
  <p><b>&#149; Anyone can do it. Start a tree seed in a cup, or a seedling in 
    a pot. If you have no place to set it out later, give it to someone who does, 
    and then watch it grow together. Find a place to plant a seedling or a sapling 
    or the largest tree you can handle alone.</b></p>
