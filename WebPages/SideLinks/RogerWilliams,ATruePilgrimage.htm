<p align="center"><font size="+1">A HISTORY OF THE BAPTISTS</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">The First Baptists in America</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The first Baptists on this continent were found in New England. That portion 
    of the country was settled by the Separatists and the Puritans. The first 
    named of these parties established Plymouth Colony and were known as the Pilgrim 
    Fathers; the Puritans at a later date occupied Massachusetts Bay.</p>
  <p>One point must be kept clearly in mind. In what is now called Massachusetts, 
    there were in the early days <i>two colonies</i>, two centers of life and 
    influence, very distinct one from the other. There was the little colony of 
    Plymouth, beginning in 1620, and the larger colony of Massachusetts Bay, beginning 
    in 1628, which centered around Salem, Boston and Charleston. These colonies 
    were about forty miles apart, a wilderness separated them by the land route, 
    so that the principle intercourse was by water. But they were not so far separated 
    by distance and physical difficulties as their general ideas and ways of looking 
    at the great questions which were then up for consideration. So these two 
    little confederacies, for a time, lived much to themselves.</p>
  <p>The people at Plymouth were called Pilgrims (see 1 Peter 2:11); the people 
    in the Bay were called Puritans. The people at Plymouth were called Separatists, 
    and those at the Bay were called Non Conformists, and these words conveyed 
    entirely separate ideas. <font size="2">(Increase N. Tarbox, Plymouth and 
    the Bay, <i>The Congressional Quarterly Magazine, </i>April, 1875), (Continued).</font>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We will see that one of these ways disappeared soon after the 
  time of Roger Williams (save for those Friends and anabaptists--Amish, Mennonites 
  and Hutterites--who appeared later in the Mid-Atlantic states and on the Northern 
  plains), while the other path led directly into the events of the American Revolution 
  and the founding of the American Nation/Empire. (Please open up the pages of 
  the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, and chapter 2 of the Book of 1 Peter...KJV, 
  at this very same time in history).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, 
    and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy 
    Ghost,</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And have tasted the good word of God and the powers of 
    the world to come,</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">If they shall Fall Away, to renew them again unto repentance; 
    seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open 
    shame. </font></i>(The effects of this saying are yet to be fully realized).</p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft 
    upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth 
    blessing from God:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected, 
    and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned...</font></i><font size="+1">(Hebrews 
    6:4-8).</font></p>
  <p>(Continued)...Most of the Separatists were North of England men. They denounced 
    the Church of England as corrupt and they wholly separated from its communion. 
    When the heavy hand of persecution fell on them they migrated to Holland. 
    The surroundings in the Netherlands were not favorable to them...So they crossed 
    the seas and established themselves at Plymouth as &quot;the forerunners of 
    an innumerable host.&quot; </p>
  <p>The Puritans on the other hand did not break with the Church of England. 
    They dissented from many of its tenets but did not separate from it. They 
    thought that the church ought to be reformed and remodeled. When the Puritans 
    met with no success in this direction they likewise sought a home in the New 
    World. Rev. Francis Higgenson, upon leaving England, in 1629, is reported 
    to have said: &quot;We will not say, as the Separatists were wont to say at 
    their leaving of England: Farewell, Babylon, Farewell Rome! But we will say, 
    Farewell, dear England, and all the Christian friends there. We do not go 
    to New England as separatists from the Church of England; though we cannot 
    but separate from the corruption of it. But we go to practice the positive 
    part of church reformation; and propagate the gospel in America.&quot; <font size="2">(Cotton 
    Mather, <i>Magnalia</i>, Lib.III.sec.1)</font>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">From Rome to England, to America, the words of Revelation, 
  chapter 17, came upon the shores of this Western continent.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Governor Winthrop likewise said: &quot;We esteem it an honor to call the 
    Church of England, from whence we rise, our dear mother, and cannot part from 
    our native land, where she especially resides, without much sadness of heart 
    and many tears in our eyes. For acknowledging that such hope and faith as 
    we have obtained in the common salvation we have received in her bosom and 
    sucked it from her breasts, we leave it not, therefore, as loathing that milk 
    wherewith we were nourished there; but, blessing God for parentage and education 
    as members of the same God, shall always rejoice in her good, and unfeignedly 
    grieve for any sorrow that shall ever betide her, and while we draw breath, 
    sincerely desire and endeavor the continuance and abundance of her welfare, 
    with the enlargement of her bounds in the kingdom of Jesus Christ&quot;...</p>
  <p>The Puritan was an Anglo-Saxon with an infusion of Norman blood--his northern 
    imagination inflamed by the oriental imagery of the Old Testament, and his 
    intellect submissive to a creed drawn from the New, and shaped by the logic 
    of Geneva...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Geneva, where John Calvin and others established a theocratic 
  order, to which men were subjected against their will, and punished, and executed, 
  for their refusal to adhere and obey. Be aware, this is a new planting, as it 
  is written: <i>An evil Tree cannot bring forth hood fruit</i>. Calvin's doctrine 
  has nothing to do with the doctrine of Christ that Paul planted, as Paul himself 
  wrote: <i>For I am free from the blood of all men</i>. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Much of the ridicule heaped upon the Puritans was caused by their external 
    peculiarities...For many years after the Restoration they were the theme of 
    unmeasured invective and derision...They were not men of letters...The unostentatious 
    simplicity of their dress, their sour aspect, their nasal twang, their stiff 
    posture, their long graces, their Hebrew names, the scriptural phrases which 
    they introduced on every occasion, their contempt of human learning, their 
    detestation of polite amusements, were indeed fair game for the laughers. 
    &quot;But it is not from the laughers alone that the philosophy of history 
    is to be learnt. And he who approaches the subject should carefully guard 
    against the influence of their potent ridicule which has already misled so 
    many excellent writers.&quot; <font size="2">(<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, Milton's 
    Treatise on Christian Doctrine)</font>.</p>
  <p>The First settlers came to this country with an earnest purpose. &quot;The 
    early settlements of the English colonies,&quot; says McMahon, &quot;within 
    what are now the limits of the United States, were, in general, similar in 
    the causes and circumstances of their establishment. It was not the mere <i>spirit 
    of enterprise</i>, the <i>thirst for gain</i>, nor the love of novelty, which 
    impelled the early emigrants to forsake their native land, and to sever all 
    ties which bound them to the homes of their fathers. It was not for these 
    alone, that they took up their abode in the wilderness; made their dwelling 
    with the savages; and encountered with cheerfulness and alacrity all the privations 
    and dangers of a country not net rescued from the rudeness of nature. These 
    causes may have contributed...but we must look elsewhere for the primary causes 
    of their establishment...They sought <i>freedom</i> from the religious and 
    civil shackles, and oppressive institutions, of their parent country...Here, 
    unchecked...they might be permitted to lay, broad and deep, the <i>Foundations</i> 
    of their civil and religious <i>liberties</i>. (continued)...</p>

  is Liberty...</i>(2 Corinthians 3:17), and:</font></p>

  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">For when they </font></i>(the founders of 
    the American political order)<i><font size="+1"> speak great swelling words

    Peter 2:18-20).</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="+1">__________</font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">For it is written, that Abraham had Two sons, 
    the one by the bondmaid, the other by the freewoman.</font></i></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">But he who was of the bondwoman was born

    is the Mother of us all...</font></i></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">(So) as then he that was born after the flesh

  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">Nevertheless, what saith the scripture? Cast 
    out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not br heir

    Christ hath made us free...</font></i><font size="+1">(Galatians 5:1).</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="+1">__________</font></p>
  <p align="left">(Continued)...The Separatists have been described as men with 
    their &quot;hearts full of charity, kindliness and toleration; their minds 
    broadened by experience in a land where religion was free to all men.&quot; 
    The Puritans had no such ideas. They desired liberty for themselves and perfect 
    toleration; but they were not willing to grant this liberty to others....</p>
  <p align="left">The tragedy is, that those who came to America, on account of 
    being persecuted in their own land, should here persecute others. This was 
    true of all parties except the Baptists and the Quakers...The Congregationalists 
    (Puritans) of New England formed their government on the theory of a theocracy. 
    &quot;What they wished was a State, which they could enjoy in common as an 
    ordinance of God. But the State was to unfold within the church. As they regarded 
    the government as God's servant, so likewise all citizens, as such, were to 
    serve God.&quot; <font size="2">(Whether they chose to or not)</font>. John 
    Davenport, as quoted by Cotton, says: &quot;The Theocracy, that is, God's 
    government, is to be established as the best form of government. Here the 
    people, who choose its civil rulers, are God's people, in covenant with him, 
    they are members of the churches; God's laws and God's servants are enquired 
    of for counsel.&quot;...</p>
  <p align="left">It was among the first settlers of New England that the Baptists 
    were found. There is no certainty that any of the Pilgrim Fathers were Baptists...but 
    there was from the first a Baptist taint about Plymouth....And while they 
    continued in this state of quiescence or concealement, they met with no trouble 
    or opposition, (until)....</p>
