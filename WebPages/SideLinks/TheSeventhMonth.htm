  <p><b>This is the history of the division of the days of the law and the testimony, 
    of the events of the years, of their (year) weeks of their Jubilees throughout 
    all the years of the world, as the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai when 
    he went up to receive the tables of the law of the commandments, according 
    to the Voice of God as he said unto him, &quot;Go up to the top of the Mount.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>And it came to pass in the first year of the exodus of the children of 
    Israel out of Egypt in the Third month, on the Sixteenth day of the month, 
    that God spoke to Moses, saying: &quot;Come up to me on the Mount, and I will 
    give thee Two tables of stone of the law and the commandment, which I have 
    written, that thou mayest teach them.&quot; And Moses went up into the Mount 
    of God and the glory of the Lord abode on Mount Sinai, and a Cloud overshadowed 
    it Six days. And He called to Moses on the Seventh day out of the midst of 
    the Cloud, and the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a flaming 
    Fire on top of the Mount. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(It 
    was like seeing directly into all of the events of the 20th century..see Hebrews 
    12:13-29)</font><b>. And Moses was on the mount Forty days and Forty nights. 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>AND GOD TAUGHT HIM THE EARLIER AND THE LATER HISTORY OF THE DIVISION OF 
    ALL THE DAYS OF THE LAW AND OF THE TESTIMONY. And He said: &quot;Incline thine 
    heart to every word which I shall speak to thee on this Mount, and write them 
    in a book in order that their generations may see how I have not forsaken 
    them for all the evil which they have wrought in transgressing the covenant 
    which I have established between Me and thee for their generations this day 
    on Mount Sinai. And thus it will come to pass when all these things come upon 
    them, that they will recognize that I am more righteous than they all in their 
    judgments, and in all their actions, and they will recognize that I have been 
    truly with them. </b></p>
  <p><b>And do thou write for thyself all these words which I declare unto thee 
    this day, for I know their rebellion and their stiff neck, before I bring 
    them into the land (the whole State of Mind) of which I sware to their fathers, 
    to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, saying: 'Unto your seed will I give 
    a land flowing with milk and honey.' AND THEY WILL EAT AND BE SATISFIED, AND 
    THEY WILL TURN TO STRANGE GODS, TO GODS WHICH CANNOT DELIVER THEM FROM AUGHT 
    OF THEIR TRIBULATION: and this witness shall be heard for a witness against 
    them. FOR THEY WILL FORGET ALL MY COMMANDMENTS (EVEN) ALL THAT I HAVE COMMANDED 
    THEM, AND THEY WILL WALK AFTER THE GENTILES, and after their uncleanness, 
    and after their shame, and will serve their gods (their ideas), AND THESE 
    WILL PROVE UNTO THEM AN OFFENSE AND A TRIBULATION AND AN AFFLICTION AND A 
    SNARE. And many will perish and they will be taken captive, and will fall 
    into the hands of the enemy, because they have forsaken My ordinances and 
    My statutes, AND THE FESTIVALS OF MY COVENANT, AND MY SABBATHS, AND MY HOLY 
    PLACE WHICH I HAVE HALLOWED FOR MYSELF IN THE MIDST OF THE LAND, THAT I SHOULD 
    PUT MY NAME UPON IT, AND THAT THEY SHOULD DWELL THERE. And they will make 
    to themselves high places and groves and graven images, and they will worship, 
    each his own (graven image), so as to go astray, AND THEY WILL SACRIFICE THEIR 
    CHILDREN UNTO DEMONS, and to all the works of the error of their hearts. And 
    I will send witnesses unto them, that I may witness against them, BUT THEY 
    WILL NOT HEAR, AND WILL SLAY THE WITNESSES ALSO, AND THEY WILL PERSECUTE THOSE 
    WHO SEEK THE LAW, AND THEY WILL ABROGATE AND CHANGE EVERYTHING SO AS TO WORK 
    EVIL BEFORE MINE EYES. And I will hide My face from them, and I will deliver 
    them into the hands of the Gentiles for captivity and a prey, and for devouring, 
    AND I WILL REMOVE THEM FROM THE MIDST OF THE LAND, and I will scatter them 
    among the Gentiles. AND THEY WILL FORGET ALL MY LAW AND MY COMMANDMENTS AND

  <p><b>And Moses fell on his face and prayed and said, O Lord my God, do not 
    forsake Thy people and Thy inheritance, so that they should wander in the 
    error of their hearts, and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies, 
    the Gentiles, lest they should rule over them and cause them to sin against 
    Thee. Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be lifted up upon Thy people, and create in them 
    an upright spirit, and let not the spirit of Beliar rule over them to accuse 
    them before Thee, and to ensnare them from all the paths of righteousness, 
    so that they may perish before Thy face. But they are Thy people and Thy inheritance, 
    which Thou hast delivered with Thy great Power from the hands of the Egyptians: 
    create in them a clean heart and a holy spirit, and let them not be ensnared 
    in their sins from henceforth until eternity. And the Lord said unto Moses: 
    I know their contrariness and their thoughts, and their stiffneckedness, AND 
    THEY WILL NOT BE OBEDIENT TILL THEY CONFESS THEIR OWN SIN AND THE SIN OF THEIR 
    FATHERS. And after this they will return to me in all uprightness and with 
    all their heart and with all their soul, and I will circumcise the foreskin 
    of their heart and the foreskin of the heart of their seed, and I will create 
    in them a holy spirit, and I will cleanse them so that they shall not turn 
    away from Me from that day unto eternity. And their souls will cleave to Me 
    and to all My commandments, and they will fulfill My commandments, and I will

    the priesthood in Israel and that of Melchizedek himself are said in the Scripture

    CAUSE OF) RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL ACHIEVE FORGIVENESS FOR THEIR SINS, (WHEREAS 
    THE WICKED WILL REAP THEIR DESERTS AND BE BROUGHT TO AN END).</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">9-10...This is the era which Isaiah terms <i>The Year of 
    Favor</i> (Isa.61:12) that is, the one designed, by God's favor, for the King 
    of Righteousness--which is what...his very name, MELCHIZEDEK prefigures--to 
    come into his dominion (HE WILL TAKE THE LEAD AMONG GOD'S HEAVENLY SAINTS 
    IN EXECUTING THE VARIOUS SENTENCES OF JUDGMENT, even as it is said in the 
    Songs of David: <i>God has taken His stand in the council divine, among the 
    beings divine, to render judgment </i>(Ps.82:1)...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">12-14...THERE IS A FURTHER REFERENCE TO THIS FINAL JUDGMENT 
    IN THE CONTINUATION OF THE VERSE FROM THE PSALTER. <i>How long, </i>we read, 
    <i>will you go judging unjustly and showing partiality to the wicked? </i>(Ps.7.9). 
    THE ALLUSION IS TO BELIAL AND THE SPIRITS OF HIS ILK--THAT IS, TO (elders 
    who sit in assizes but) DEFY GOD'S STATUTES IN ORDER TO PERVERT JUSTICE. The 
    future King of Righteousness (Melchizedek redivivus) WILL EXECUTE (upon them) 
    GOD'S AVENGING JUDGMENT, and at the same time DELIVER (the Just) FROM THE 
    HANDS OF BELIAL...WITH ALL THE ANGELS (OF RIGHTEOUSNESS) AT HIS AID, HE WILL 
    BLAST THE COUNCIL OF BELIAL (TO DESTRUCTION)</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">15-16...THE VISITATION OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING IS THE 
    SAME AS THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION OF WHICH THE PROPHET ISAIAH SPEAKS IN THE WORDS: 
    <i>How fair upon the mountains are THE FEET of the herald who proclaims &quot;Shalom! 
    (peace),&quot; the herald of good tidings who proclaims &quot;Salvation!&quot; 
    who says to Zion, 'Your God has now claimed His kingdom!' </i>(Isaiah 52:7), 
    for the word <i>shalom</i> may also be read <i>shillum</i>, &quot;retribution,&quot; 
    as who should say, &quot;All is hell!&quot; rather than &quot;All is well!&quot;</font></p>

    THE ONE ANOINTED WITH THE SPIRIT (Isa.61:1)--THE SAME WHOM DANIEL CALLS THE 
    ANOINTED LEADER WHO WILL MAKE AN APPEARANCE AT THE END OF SEVEN WEEKS (OF 
    YEARS)--THAT IS, AT THE FINAL JUBILEE. SIMILARLY, THE HERALD OF GOOD THINGS, 
    THE SAME WHO PROCLAIMS (SHALOM) IS HE OF WHOM IT IS WRITTEN: <i>The Lord has 
    sent me to comfort all who mourn...</i>(Isa.61:3)...THE COMFORT IN QUESTION

  <p><b>(When God shakes the World Tree all the dead and unfruitful branches that

  <p><b>SH'MINI ATZERET...Some translate this as the Eighth Day of Completion, 
    others the Eighth Day of Assembly. For <i>atzeret</i> means putting a boundary, 
    restraining, collecting--either the days (and so, completion of the festival) 
    or the people (and so, assembly of the multitude).</b></p>
  <p><b>We can understand the restraint as inward too. While the Temple stood, 
    we turned from the expansive week of the multiple sacrifices of Sukkot to 
    the minimum: one bull, one ram. The Talmud teaches that this reduction of 
    the sacrifices from 70 bulls to one, represents God's turning from the concern 
    with the 70 nations--the whole world--to concern for Israel alone. (Understand 
    Romans 11:25,26)...</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And finally <i>SIMCHAT' TORAH</i>...Rejoicing In The Law...The 
  End of the Law, and the Beginning of the Law again. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Sh'mini Atzeret teaches us to put seeds of Yod, of new life, quietly underground, 
    there to hibernate until spring. But it is hard to wait. We need some proof 
    of our new life now. So Sh'mini Atzeret also carries within itself the proof 
    of the flowering. On the second day of the festival we turn from the natural 
    world to the Torah--AND BEHOLD, ITS END LEADS AT ONCE TO ITS BEGINNING!</b></p>
  <p><b>About ten centuries ago, the second day of Sh'mini Atzeret was turned 
    into Simchat Torah--a special holy day of joy in the Torah. It celebrates 
    the completion of the annual cycle for reading the Torah--the Five Books of 
    Moses--and it is when we start afresh (but this time in righteousness and 
    truth, in mercy and in Peace)...But there is more the content of this end 
    and this beginning underscore the lesson. For at the end of the Five Books 
    is the death of Moses our Teacher; and at the beginning is the Creation of 
    the World. So Simchat Torah acts out by public proclamation what Sh'mini Atzeret 
    preaches as an underlying fact of life: THAT FROM SEEMING DEATH COMES PROFOUND 
    NEW ENERGY FOR BIRTH.</b></p>
  <p><b>The Seven <i>hakkafot </i>(or circlings of the synagogue with the Torah 
    Scroll) provided Kabbalists with an opportunity to see in Simchat Torah a 
    microcosm and a unification of the Seven days of Sukkot...On Simchat Torah, 
    these seven turn into the Seven circlings of the Torah. And since these circlings 
    take place not on seven different days but within One day, Simchat Torah is 
    the time when the Seven (lower) Sephirot fuse into Unity, and show that they 
    are in fact emanations of the Holy One...</b></p>
  <p><b>When this congregation-wide reaffirmation of the Torah has been fulfilled, 
    the community focuses itself around two highly respected members--one who 
    is called up as <i>chatan Torah </i>or <i>kallat Torah</i>--bridegroom or 
    bride of the Torah--to complete the reading, from Deuteronomy 33:27 to the 
    end; and the other as <i>chatan B'reshit </i> or <i>kallat B'reshit, </i> 
    bridegroom or bride of :In the Beginning,&quot; to begin reading all over 
    again. In some congregations, the Torah scroll is unrolled the whole way and 
    held by the congregants in a huge circle around the room. Thus the end and 
    the beginning stand next to each other...and the congregation is encircled 
    not only figuratively but literally--letter by letter--by the Torah...</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;BLESSED ARE YOU, THE SHIELD OF ABRAHAM. You are mighty forever, 
    Lord; You revive the dead and are great in saving Power.&quot; The reader 
    then chants a prayer poem by Eleazar Kalir that is presumably a plea for rain, 
    but in fact asks some Thirty times not for rain, BUT FOR WATER. In a way this 
    prayer brings all the water imagery of the Tishri festivals to a flood of 
    meaning, for it reminds us of all the adventures our forebears had with wells 
    and seas and rivers.</b></p>
  <p><b>The prayer can be sung in English to the tune of :Cool Clear Water,&quot; 
    and the translation of David de Sola Pool:</b></p>

  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Song2.gif" width="526" height="358"></p>
  <p><b>And finally the prayer comes to a climax</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b><font size="+1"></font></b><font size="+1">For you are the Lord 
          our God, who makes the wind blow and the rain fall--for blessing and 
          not for disaster; for life and not for death; for plenty and not for 
          famine.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>From this point on...until the first day of Pesach (Passover again), the 
    congregations mentions that God is the One who makes the wind blow and the 
    rain fall. Once we experience the pleading of this prayer, the Sukkot water 
    pouring takes on a deeper quality. Perhaps it was intended not to coerce nature, 
    but to free the people from their own dryness so that they could one week 
    later plead with God. It is to be our prayers that water heaven, not the water 
    poured upon the ground.</b></p>
  <p><b>Why is the prayer for rain introduced into the blessing that praises God 
    for reviving the dead? Because rain revives the parched and deadened earth, 
    gives life to seeds that are buried underground. And so Sh'mini Atzeret ends, 
    WE LOOK ONCE MORE TO THE GREAT REVIVAL.</b></p>
  <p><b>In the afternoon, although Sukkot is over and it is no longer a <i>mitzvah</i> 
    to eat in the sukkah, the traditional custom was to eat there anyway one last 
    time, as a gesture of love and respect, and on leaving to say: &quot;JUST 
    AS I MERITED TO SIT IN THE SUKKAH, MAY IT BE YOUR WILL THAT NEXT YEAR I MERIT 
    TO SIT IN THAT SUKKAH MADE FROM THE SKIN OF LEVIATHAN. NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM. 
    For when Messiah comes, according to folk legend, God will turn leatherworker 
    (as at the end of Eden when God made leather garments for Adam and Eve). God 
    will at last slay the primeval sea monster Leviathan, and from its skin will 
    tailor the Great Sukkah that enfolds all Israel in peace. Under that sukkah 
    we will all sit, to dine on Leviathan's meat. No longer will we need to fear 
    a monster from the deep--the ocean deep, or the depths of our own souls. Seasons
