    The Seven Seers (Sapta-Rishis)<br>
    HT71 <br>
  </p>
  <p>The seers are mysterious beings related to the origin of both man and knowledge. 
    Often represented as 'human' sages, they nevertheless are conceived as eternal 
    powers, symbolizing the primordial energies responsible for all manifest creation. 
    They are 'seers' by virtue of being able to see the divine law which governs 
    all creation, and indeed sustains it. </p>
</div>
<p>The most important seers are believed to be seven in number, and said reside 
  in the sky as the seven stars of the Great Bear. According to the Shatapatha 
  Brahmana, these seven are the 'authors' of the Vedic hymns. Their names are, 
  Gautama, Bharadvaja, Vishvamitra, Jamadagni, Vashishtha, Kashyapa, and Atri. 
  Here inscribed in the 'takri' script as the 'sons of Brahma,' are these very 
  names. They sit surrounding a small pile of smoldering ash, much in the tradition 
  of Shaivite saints.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/SevenRishis.jpg" width="300" height="298"> 
</p>
<p>At the center in the top row sits Jamadagni, with his head thrown back, and 
  his hair reaching his thighs. With the right hand he holds a long rosary. Next 
  to him in the clockwise direction is Gautama, clad only in a loin-cloth, with 
  prodigiously long nails, and similarly long hair under his armpits. He holds 
  his hands above his head, in a tight, clasping posture. </p>
<p>Vashishtha is next, holding in his extended right hand a ceremonial water vessel, 
  his left hand resting on his right knee. He is adorned all over with tulsi beads, 
  including his chest, wrists, upper-arms, and the crown on his head. He sits 
  on a small white prayer mat. </p>
<p>Following Vashishtha is Atri. He tells upon beads held in his right hand that 
  is enclosed in a gomukha-glove, and at the same time also holds a small rosary 
  in his other hand. Bhardavaja stands on his head, performing a yogic asana, 
  with his two hands supporting his mortal frame. Kashyapa hods a coconut shell 
  in his left hand, which holds ritual ashes which he has applied all over his 
  body, and continues to do so on his forehead. He is bare except for a leopard 
  skin covering his genitals. </p>
<p>Last is Vishvamitra, rendered the most elaborate of all. Seated on an antelope 
  skin, he holds in his hands various sacred texts, which also lie by his side. 
  His mouth is bound with a cloth. This probably refers to a long vow of silence 
  this seer is believed to have undertaken.</p>

<p align="center"><b>REVELATION 1:16, 20.</b></p>
<p align="center">RGVEDA</p>
<p>Sapta rsayah-The Big Dipper (ursa maior)...In the oldest Indian text, the Rgveda, 
  the seven stars of Ursa Maior, in English variously called &#145;Great Dipper&#146;,&#145;Great 
  Wagon&#146; (Wain) &#145;Great Bear&#146; appear just once as &#147;the bears&#148; 
  (RV 1.24.10, a designation quoted in a&acute;&middot;late Vedic text, Satapatha 
  Brahmana 2.1.2.4 &#145;formerly called cf. Taittiriya Aranyaka 2.11.2). This 
  name is similar to that of the Homeric Greeks, where the Bearess (hearktos) 
  is followed by her children (Iliad 18.487, Odyssey 5.273 &#147;called the Wain 
  which always wheels around in the same place&#148;). Both indicate an Indo-European 
  age of the concept, and probably a still older hunters&#146; idea of stone age 
  antiquity. But in a very late passage of the same Vedic text (RV10.82.2) we 
  already find this asterism under the name &#147;the Seven Sages&#148; (sapta 
  rsayah).</p>
<p>(1) The seven primordial sages (rsi) have been transported into Heaven, again 
  not unlike the Greek heroes, as one of the few exceptions of persons admitted 
  after the (2) gods reached heaven and &#147;shut the door behind them.&#148; 
  (3) There, their white bones&acute; (sarirani) shine each night. However, the 
  concept of Seven Sages is purely Indian, a local development. (4) The Seven 
  Sages are seen close to the celestial NorthPole, so that they can forever be 
  seen (if one lives above circa 30 degrees North), as the seven stars of the 
  &#145;Great Dipper&#146; (ursa maior). Therefore, they appear to be for-ever 
  &#145;in the highest heaven&#146;, never to leave this position, like other 
  deceased persons, whether transposed as stars or just following the yearly movement 
  of the Milky Way. This is connected with the movement of the Big Dipper as well. 
  Kuiper pointed out some 20 years ago (5) that&middot;the gods such as Varuna 
  turn over a heavenly casket and empty its contents over the earth beneath it, 
  e.g. RV&middot;5.85.3 &#147;Varuna has poured out the cask, with its rim turned 
  downwards, over heaven and earth, and the interspace. Thereby THE KING OF WHOLE 
  WORLD SPRINKLES THE SOIL, AS THE RAIN (SPRINKLES) THE BARLEY.&#148; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Hebrews 
  6:1-8)</font>. However, the identity of this heavenly casket has escaped us 
  for many years. The key for an understanding is Atharvaveda 10.9.8 which runs 
  as follows: &#147;A bowl (camasa) with the orifice downwards, bottom-side up, 
  in it is deposited glory of all forms; there sit together the seven seers, who 
  have become the keepers of it, THE GREAT ONE.&#148; </p>
<p>Even clearer is &acute;Brhadaranyaka Upanisad 2.2.4 (SB 14.5.2.4) &#147;There 
  is a cup with its mouth below and its bottom up. In it is placed every form 
  of glory. On its rim sit seven seers. Voice as an eighth is united with prayer 
  (brahman)&#148; [Hume]. The &#147;commentary&#148; by the author of this Upanisad 
  passage even identifies the very Rsis: &#147;On its rim sit seven seers....the 
  seven Rsis identified with Ursa Major.This asterism actually can be observed 
  to turn upside down every night. Ursa Maior has the form of a big spoon that 
  is emptied out every night: it slowly turns around, scooping up the heavenly 
  water and then releases it over the earth.The image actually is not so rare 
  as we might think... It has its similarities in ancient and modern Japan (hokutoshichisei, 
  the &#145;northern spoon&#146;) and in North American English, where Ursa Maior 
  is called &#147;the Big Dipper&#148;.One of the early generations of Japanese 
  gods (coming after Izanagi/Izanami) in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki also represents 
  a name of this meaning. Even in South America where the Incas regarded the Milky 
  Way as a river,the god of thunder, Inti, was seen in the asterism of theGreat 
  Bear, where he scooped water from the Milky Way,in order to wet the earth. This 
  image is also close to the Black North American one of the Big Dipper as a &#147;drinking 
  gourd.&#148; The Black slaves who in the 19th century tried to escape to Canada 
  used these code words in their songs: &#147;follow the drinking gourd!&#148; 
  These similarities which go beyond the idea of a Heavenly River and a Big Ladle 
  or Spoon should alert us for more similarities in myth, spread all over the 
  American and Eurasian area. </p>
<p>The Old Iranian texts (Avesta: Yast 8.12, 12.28, 13.60) have a similar expression, 
  &#147;the seven signs&#148; (hapto-iringa), which would be sapta&middot;linga(ni) 
  in Sanskrit. (Jaiminiya Brahmana 2.302 lokanam punyatamo yam ...sapta rsaya

<p align="center">Traditions of Himalayan Masters</p>
<p align="center">By Pandit Rajmani Tigunait</p>
<p align="center">Courtesy and Copyright Himalayan Publishers</p>
<p>I was gifted this book by the Publishers. Enjoyed reading truths. The world's 
  most complex truths presented in simple English, so easy to understand yet so 
  difficult to imbibe and practice. The content is verbatim from the book.</p>
<p>&quot; The tradition of Himalayan masters refers not so much to a geographical 
  identity as to a symbolic representation of the heights of spiritual wisdom. 
  Shankaracharya established the tradition of the Himalayan masters some 1200 
  years ago. However, written record of this tradition first appears in the Vedic 
  literature. The Chhandogya Upanishad which was compiled app 900 B.C. mentions 
  an unbroken lineage of more than 60 generations. Even if we to assign only 25 
  years to each generation, it would take us back to 2400 B.C. According to oral 
  tradition, the history goes back to atleast 5,000 years.</p>
<p>These masters...were freethinkers, explorers of truth, and the architects of 
  human civilization. It is they who drew the blueprint of spirituality, and the 
  philosophers, saints and yogis who came later built and elaborated the structure 
  on the basis of this blueprint. A number of yogis go to the Himalayas for higher 
  training. If they are well prepared they are able to join the cave monasteries 
  that are hidden in the interiors of the Himalayas. </p>
<p>From the literary point of view, the tradition of the Himalayan masters refers 
  to the tradition that was expounded in the Vedas, and then gradually evolved 
  while passing through the development of the Upanishads and Puranas, all the 
  way to the saintly literature written in the regional languages of India. Thus, 
  in essence, the tradition of the Himalayan masters is the tradition of the Vedic 
  stages.</p>
<p>The breath and scope of spiritual literature that issued from the sages of 
  the Himalayan tradition is enormous. After some thought, we elected to include 
  only the eight masters whose teachings have the most direct bearings on the 
  questions that confront most serious seekers today. Accordingly this volume 
  has chapters on Sanatkumara, Vashistha, Dattatreya, Parashurama and Shankaracharya. 
  Vyasa, the most famous of all the ancient masters was excluded because his work 
  is widely available. The other three masters Vidyaranya Yati, Maadhusudana Saraswati 
  and Swami Rama are considerably more modern.</p>
<p>This piece is divided into five chapters.</p>
<p>Sanatkumara - is a conversation between Sage Narada and Sanatkumara taken primarily 
  from the Chhandogya Upanishad on how to attain happiness. Acquisition of intellectual 
  knowledge is not enough, we need to practice what we know. Some super simple 
  tips. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Vasistha - tells about the Philosophy of Reflectionism. It has the complete 
  inner dialogue that Vashistha had with his mind, is beautifully narrated by 
  Valmiki in the Yoga Vashistha. This work is a treasure house of Vashistha's 
  spiritual experiences, spiritual experiences, which he shared with his beloved 
  student Lord Ram. There is also problems of the mind, taming the senses and 
  mind and six qualities of mind that speed transformation. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Dattatreya - is a conversation between a King and Dattatreya, where the latter 
  tells the former about who HIS TWENTY FOUR GURUS are and why. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Revelation 
  5:14)</font>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Parashurama - is a conversation between Dattatreya and Parashurama. It covers 
  mind, meditation and self-mastery, purposes of spiritual practices and categories 
  of enlightened beings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Shankaracharya - tells you about his visit to Benaras and his arguments with 
  the husband wife duo of Mandana Misra and Bharati. </p>

  SAPTA-RSI<br>
  Seven Sages</p>
<p align="left"> The constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear (Rksa), is forever 
  present in the northern sky; SEVEN STELLAR PUPILS SEEN AS SEVEN ASTRAL EYES, 
  RADIANT THROUGH SELF-REFLEXION. Their path about the Pole defines the innermost 
  third of the sky, AND MARKS THE CELESTIAL DIVISION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. This 
  bear's claw is the ancient sage's cleaver. <br>
  <br>
  Those Sapta-Rsi are named:</p>
<p>1. Visvamitra<br>
  Dubhe (Dubb, Ak): Bear, Alpha Urs&aelig; Majoris. </p>
<p>2. Jamadagni<br>
  Merak (Mirak): Loins, Beta Urs&aelig; Majoris. </p>
<p>3. Bharadvaja<br>
  Phad (Phecda; Phekda; Phegda; Phekha; Phacd): Thigh, Gamma Urs&aelig; Majoris. 
</p>
<p>4. Gautama<br>
  Megrez (Kaffa): Insertion-point (of the bear's tail), Delta Urs&aelig; Majoris. 
</p>
<p>5. Atri<br>
  Alioth (Aliath): Goat, Epsilon Urs&aelig; Majoris. </p>
<p>6. Vasistha<br>
  Mizar (Mizat; Mirza): Wrapping (Loincloth), Zeta Urs&aelig; Majoris. </p>
<p>7. Kasyapa<br>
  Alkaid (Benetnash, Benetnasch, Elkeid): Chief Daughter of the Bier, Eta Urs&aelig; 
  Majoris.<br>
  <br>
  Across the Galactic Equator, a cluster of six (Seven) stars called Pleiades 
  is the first constellation of the Indian astral calendar; and they are remembered 
  as the remaining wives of the Sapta-Rsi. Only ever-faithful Anasuya dwells with 
  her consort. </p>
<p>In Old Tamil, Min indicates a glittering object, and names both a Star and 
  a Fish; the Pleiades are thus Six-Fish (Aru-min), and Ursa major is the school 
  of Seven-Fish (Elu-Min). </p>
<p>In Sumerian Cuneiform, every divine name is prefixed with the Star-pictogram, 
  which indicates God (Dingir) or Sky (Anu ~ the supreme deity of ancient Sumer).</p>

<p align="center">SEVEN JEWELS<br>
</p>
<p>SAPTA-RATNA, the seven jewels talisman, combines the gems which correspond 
  to the planets ruling the seven days of the week. Every day of the week is governed 
  over by a specific planet. In many languages the days are named directly after 
  the planet that rules over them. In English we must simply examine the Anglo-Saxon 
  origin of the names of the days to see the correspondence.</p>
<p>Sunday (Sun), Monday (Moon), and Saturday (Saturn) still remain intact. </p>
<p>Tuesday (Mars) is derived from &quot;Tewes,&quot; the Anglo-Saxon name for 
  Mars, god of war.</p>
<p>Wednesday (Mercury) comes from Woden's day, the Anglo-Saxon name for Mercury, 
  the messenger. </p>
<p>Thursday (Jupiter) is from Thor, the Anglo-Saxon name for the lord of the demigods, 
  Jupiter.</p>
<p>And Friday (Venus) is from Frides, the Anglo-Saxon name for Venus, the deity 
  of art, beauty, and material enjoyment. </p>
<p>In practically every other language from Hindi to Thai the weekdays are directly 
  named after their ruling planet.</p>
<p align="center">Sri Raghunath Temple - Saptasajya.</p>
<p>Sri Raghunath Temple of Saptya sajya is one of the Important Baisnav temples 
  of Dhenkanal. One can proceed 12Km in the Sankarpur road from Dhenkanal Bus 
  stop and then turn west at the Badagila chowk and pass two K.M. to reach Saptya 
  Sajya a scenic beauty where the holy temple of Maryada Purusottama Sri Ramachandra 
  is located at about 900 feet at the hilltop. A mountains stream flows down as 
  if touching His Holy Feet in veneration.</p>
<p> Mythologically this place is important and many legends are still available. 
  Its name is Sapta Sajya because, there are seven hills surrounding the area. 
  Again there is story that, the Saptarashi had their ashramas here in this place. 
  There is also a mythological story, that, Sriram during his exile or Vanabasha 
  had spent seven days in this beautiful spot. Secondly the Pandavas during their 
  12 years of exile and one year of Agyanta Vasa had chosen this mountains for 
  shelter.</p>
<p> However the worship of Lord Sri Ram for the first time began on 18.4.1956 
  at Saptya Sajaya . The king of Dhenkanal constituted a committee of some eminent 
  persons among whom Sri Harekrishna Pattnaik was one. The eminent sculptor Late 
  Kumar Moharana built the statues of Sri Rama ,Laxman and Sita who were being 
  worshipped in a thatched temple. After 1958, due to patronage of Rajamata Ratnaprava 
  Devi, H.K.Pattnaik and Late Krishna Chandra Harichandan took initiative to construct 
  the present temple. The marble statues of Sri Ram, Laxman and Sita were brought 
  from Jaipur in Rajastan and the then Chief Minister of Orissa Late Rejendra 
  Narayan Singdeo inaugurated the temple by organising Four days ritualistic function 
  from 7th to 10th May,1971. The then Collector Sri Suresh Mishra IAS. and Dr.Dasarathi 
  Mishra were actively involved in this great event.</p>
<p> The Govt. constructed the Pukka road way in 1982. Inside the temple complex 
  Maa Annapurna temple was constructed in 1982,the 1st floor Kalki temple in 1985, 
  the Surya Narayan temple in 1990. Now the temple of Sri Rameswara Shiva, Sri 
  Ganesh, Sri Mahivir, and the Nabagrah Temple with each room for each graha are 
  found. Mahakali , Mata Saraswati, Sri Nrushingha temple are conceived to be 
  built in the holy complex. This scenic spot has become a good tourist and picnic 
  spot where thousands of tourists and devotees gather from different corners 
  of Orissa and India.</p>

  Intonation in Vaisnava Music<br>
  by Bhaktisiddhartha Dasanudas (1985)</p>
<p>The great Vedic scripture Srimad Bhagavatam is the epitome of Vaisnava knowledge. 
  Encyclopedic in scope, poetic in composition, profound in significance, it contains 
  all knowledge of importance to a Vaisnava; indeed, it contains&#151;at least 
  in seed form&#151;all that is knowable. Just as from the vantage of a great 
  height, features that look impressive from the ground become insignificant, 
  so from the elevated Krsna-conscious viewpoint of Srimad Bhagavatam, great sciences 
  of deep import are often summed up in a few verses or even a single line. </p>
<p>Take for example the science of music, specifically the issue of intonation 
  in music, from which all other Vedic musical concepts are derived. We find many 
  erudite tomes in the great libraries of the world containing complex expositions 
  and conflicting arguments on this subtle, highly technical subject. Yet the 
  entire topic is summed up in the following line from the Srimad Bhagavatam: 
  &quot;svarah sapta viharena bhavanti sma prajapateh&quot; ...Brahma's sensual 
  activities were manifested as the Seven notes of music (svara saptah). [Srimad-Bhagavatam 
  3.12.47]</p>
<p>This sloka (which inspires both the content and the title of this essay) is 
  commented upon in the following purport by Srila Prabhupada:</p>
<p>&quot;...The musical notes [svaras] are sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha and ni. All 
  these vibrations are originally called sabda-brahma, or spiritual sound. It 
  is said, therefore, that Brahma was created in the maha-kalpa as the incarnation 
  of spiritual sound. The Vedas are spiritual sound, and therefore there is no 
  need of material interpretation for the sound incarnation of the Vedic literature... 
  In the ultimate issue there is nothing material because everything has its origin 
  in the spiritual world. The material manifestation is therefore sometimes called 
  illusion in the proper sense of the term. For those who are realized souls there 
  is nothing but spirit.&quot;</p>
<p>These statements occur in the context of an elaborate discussion of the creation 
  of the material universe, summarized as follows: The Supreme Lord, in His form 
  as Maha-Visnu, is the master and controller of the total material substance 
  (pradhana or mahat-tattva). By His will, material substance emanates from His 
  pores and breathing in the form of innumerable material universes (brahmandas) 
  like the one in which we find ourselves today. The Lord then enters within each 
  of the universes as Visnu, and differentiates the pradhana into the categories 
  of material elements: earth, water, air, fire, space (akasa), mind, intelligence 
  and false ego (ahankara). LORD BRAHMA THEN TAKES BIRTH DIRECTLY FROM THE LOTUS 
  NAVEL OF VISNU AND CONTINUES THE MATERIAL CREATION, FASHIONING THE VARIOUS PLANETARY 
  SYSTEMS FROM THE INCHOATE MATERIAL ELEMENTS BY THE SPIRITUAL SOUND VIBRATION 
  (SABDA BRAHMA).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>...According to Srimad-Bhagavatam the svarah sapta are the basis of the Vedic 
  spiritual sound vibration used by Brahma to create the material worlds. Therefore 
  the technical terms svarah sapta and sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha and ni used in 
  the verse and purport quoted above are much more than simply Sanskrit names 
  for the notes of the musical scale. They embody in capsule form the complete 
  Vedic cosmological and spiritual world view, include a comprehensive understanding 
  of psychoacoustics and the psychophysiology of sound, and provide a working 
  knowledge of the creative potency of spiritual sound vibration to the aspiring 
  devotee and musician. </p>
<p>Finally, for the serious yogi, these same seven sounds offer a means for withdrawing 
  the soul from the entanglement of matter, for they hold the key to the creation, 
  and therefore also the annihilation, of the material universe. This paper attempts 
  to elucidate the esoteric concept of svara, revealing it as a vitally important 
  requirement for successfully chanting the Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>Research Background<br>
  In 1968-71, this author designed and performed a comprehensive series of experiments 
  with different kinds of music to determine their effects on living beings. Analysis 
  of the results revealed that of all musical styles, none is so beneficial to 
  living beings as Vedic sound vibration (raga and mantra). Of the varieties of 
  Western music tested, only very early European classical music (madrigals and 
  Gregorian chant) had any positive effect at all on living beings. All other 
  forms of modern music were shown to be deleterious to various degrees. These 
  experiments are briefly summarized in the Appendix. </p>
<p>A comprehensive survey and analysis of Vedic musical form revealed it to be 
  composed of three elements: svara (tuning), matra or tala (poetic meter or rhythmic 
  cycle) and raga (melodic species) in support of a sacred text (mantra). An additional 
  series of experiments, utilizing these elements separately, determined that 
  the major cause of the observed beneficial and therapeutic effects of Vedic 
  music is its precise tuning, different from that of the Western scale. Further 
  research in the Vedic literatures revealed that this system of tuning&#151;called 
  Just Intonation in Western music theory&#151;is explicitly and scientifically 
  explained in the Vedic literature as the sapta svarah, and has deep philosophical 
  and spiritual significance.</p>

  Temples of Tamilnadu </p>
<p>Sapta Vitanka Shrines</p>
<p>Seven temples in the vicinity of Tiruvarur have grand shrines dedicated to 
  Tyagaraja (Somaskanda) and are referred to as the Sapta Vitanka shrines. The 
  foremost of them is Tiruvarur with its grand shrine to Tyagaraja - or Veedhi 
  Vitankar. Tyagaraja at Tiruvarur is associated with the Ajapaa Natanam (dance). 
  The Ajapaa Natanam is of great mystical significance and it denotes the movement 
  of the image of Somaskanda that adorned the chest of Vishnu in synch with his 
  breath.</p>
<p>All of these seven shrines are said to have been established by the valorous 
  king Muchukunda Chakravarti, where he enshrined the 7 images of Somaskanda presented 
  to him by Indra the King of the Gods. Each of these shrines (named below) is 
  associated with a certain form of dance. Each of these shrines has been glorified 
  by the Tevaram verses of the Tamil Saivite Saints of the 1st millennium CE.

<p>Sapta Yoga international was created, inspired by Yogacharya Dr. Sushil Bhattacharya 
  in the year 1995 by the old, traditional Yoga texts of the &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot;. 
  &quot;Sapta&quot; is a Sanskrit word and is called &quot;sieves&quot;. With 
  Sapta Yoga are meant the seven systems of the Yoga, OR SYMBOLICALLY THE SEVEN 
  STAGES FOR ILLUMINATING THE SEVEN-LEVEL EXERCISE WAY OF THE LARGE YOGI SHRI 
  GHERANDA. Sapta points also to the sieved large Rishis (Seher) of India and 
  to the seven Chakras. Sapta Yoga teaches the traditional healthy body necessary 
  to receive to authentic Yoga, whose goal is a balanced psyche to form the concentration 
  ability to increase the way to a clear spirit.</p>

<p>The seven-level exercise way after Yogi Shri Gheranda and the Sapta Yoga is:</p>
<p>1. Shat Karma: Body cleaning and chamfered. <br>
  2. Asana: Body exercises, mobility. <br>
  3. Mudra: Energy control, gesture.<br>
  4. Pratyahara: Withdraw the sense, silence.<br>
  5. Pranayama: Breath exercises, techniques. <br>
  6. Dhyana: Pure view, realization<br>
  7. Samadhi: Sinking, meditation.</p>
<p>Sapta Yoga is a ganzheitliche method, which helps us to change false attitudes 
  within the physical and mental-mental range. Practice sits down together from 
  Asana, Pranayama as well as relaxation? and concentration exercises. The body 
  exercises are accomplished either dynamically in conformity with the breath, 
  or concentrated staying in a position. The first goal of the breath training 
  is a naturally flowing breath. The Asana helps to solve the mental and physical 
  blockades this free breath in the way. For Yoga there is no age limit. It does 
  not prevail achievement pressure, because than outside perfection is more important, 
  what in our inside happens. We work concentrated within the own possibilities 
  and borders. We do not compare ourselves with others. All participant inside 
  are individually promoted. In the classical Hatha Yoga, and/or Sapta Yoga aids 
  are not used, as for example rope, volumes, pegs. Sapta Yoga assumes progress 
  is possible only from own effort and particularly with exercise. Many difficult 
  Asanas become by the ease of the switching desireful experiments. The body becomes 
  flexibly, stronger and easy. If one practices Sapta Yoga during a longer period, 
  one will soon notice that not only on the physical level something changes, 
  but also within the mental-mental range. More consciousness in the everyday 
  life, more patience, we do not lose any longer so fast the version, a more affectionate 
  relationship our fellow men and the environment becomes noticeable. In the Yoga 
  it does not depend on the outside achievement. In the Yoga everything is to 
  grow organically and harmoniously. If one practiced correctly, then one feels 
  erfrischt for a Yogastunde. Yogauebungen are a method to come on the way over 
  the body to itself. Each exercise is in the reason a Meditationsuebung, with 
  itself. It is harmonization of the personality by release from Unrast, scatter 
  and splintering. The enemy number one in the Yoga is the hastyness, the hurry, 
  the unreasonable fear, one could something miss, if one leaves oneself to time. 
  If one does not leave oneself time, then one loses something....sein best: itself.</p>
