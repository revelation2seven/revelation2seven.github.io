<p align="center"><font size="+2">JOSEPHUS</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1"><br>
  Professor Richard Carrier states:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="+1"> 
  </font></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:There has long been the observation 
    that Luke-Acts contains numerous parallels with the works of Josephus, generating 
    three different theories to account for this: that Josphus used Luke, that 
    Luke used Josephus, OR THAT THEY BOTH USED SOME COMMON BUT NOW LOST SOURCE. 
    </font>(Actually the source was not lost. It was, rather, part of the Great 
    Mystery that has been hidden right there before our eyes all these centuries...Isaiah 
    29:9-14; 2 Esdras 14...KJV)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Steve 
    Mason has reviewed the arguments [1] and in summarizing the evidence concludes 
    that, besides generic parallels of genre and form and the use of identical 
    historical events, which are inconclusive as proofs, the &quot;coindidence...of 
    aim, themes, and vocabulary...seems to suggest that Luke-Acts is building 
    its case on the foundation of Josephus' defense of Judaism,&quot; and therefore 
    that Luke is consciously and significantly drawing on Josephus to supplement 
    his use of Mark and Q and to create the appearance of a real history, a notable 
    deviation from all the other Gospels which have none of the features of a 
    historical work. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This thesis, IF CORRECT, entails 
    two things. First, it undermines the historicity of certain details in the 
    Christ story unique to Luke, such as his account of the Nativity, since these 
    have been drawn from Josephus </font>(the professor presumes)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    who does not mention them in connection with Jesus, and thus it is more than 
    possible that they never were linked with Jesus until Luke decided they were. 
    This does not prove, but provides SUPPORT FOR THE VIEW THAT LUKE IS CREATING 
    HISTORY, NOT RECORDING IT. </font>(This part of Mason's thesis is partly correct 
    and partly incorrect)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><b>(continued)</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ORIGIN OF THE FOUR GOSPELS, 
    A STUDY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT...&quot;While we do not know where or by whom 
    the four New Testament gospels were written, scholars realize that they are 
    compilations assembled by what we today call editors, who drew on various 
    traditions both oral and written, of the early Christian communities. Because 
    of this the written gospels originate from complex layers of earlier materials 
    from a wide variety of sources....From a historical standpoint, this diversity 
    of sources makes it difficult to paint an accurate portrait of the historical 
    Jesus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While there are undoubtedly some 
    historically reliable teachings and accounts of Jesus in the New Testament, 
    it's imposible to know which ones are and which ones aren't. This fact was 
    recognized long ago by the early church father Origen, who pointed out that 
    some incidents related in the gospels never took place in a 'material' or 
    'corporeal' sense, but are spiritual allegories meant to be studied as such; 
    as he states quite clearly: </font></p>
  <p>&quot;The careful student may observe countless...instances in the Gospels, 
    and may thus be convinced that with the historical events, literally true, 
    different ones are interwoven which never occurred... Wherever the Word found 
    historical events capable of adaptation to these mystical truths, (She) made 
    use of them, but concealed the deeper sense from the many; but where in setting 
    forth the sequence of things spiritual there was no actual event related for 
    the sake of the more mystic meaning, SCRIPTURE INTERWEAVED THE IMAGINATIVE 
    WITH THE HISTORICAL, SOMETIMES INTRODUCING WHAT IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE, AND 
    SOMETIMES WHAT IS POSSIBLE BUT NEVER OCCURRED...And not only did the Spirit 
    thus deal with the Scriptures before the coming of Christ, but, inasmuch as 
    (She) is the same Spirit, and proceedeth from the One God, (She) has done 
    the same with the Gospels and the writings of the Apostles; for not even they 
    are purely historical, incidents which never occurred being interwoven IN 
    THE <i>CORPOREAL</i> SENSE.&quot; </p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>(Carrier continues)...</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, 
    it settles the terminus post quem of the date Luke-Acts was written: for in 
    order to draw material from the Jewish War, Luke could not have written before 
    79 A.D., and could well have written much later since the rate of publication 
    in antiquity was exceedingly limited and slow, requiring hand copies made 
    by personal slaves (though at first oral recitations would be more common 
    than written copies); and in order to draw material from the Jewish Antiquities, 
    as he appears to have done, Luke could not have written before 94 A.D., and 
    again could have written much later for the same reason. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since this thesis is of great interest 
    to students of Christianity, secular or otherwise, what follows is a simple 
    summary of Mason's argument. I shall abbreviate Luke-Acts as L, and the collective 
    histories of Josephus as J, or individually as JW (Jewish War) and JA (Jewish 
    Antiquities). Josephus also wrote an autobiography and a tract against Apion 
    (a scholar hostile to Jews), but these shall not be included in the abbreviation 
    J...Note that Mason only singles out the most impressive examples of a connection. 
    Other authors have scrupulously collected a great many more, though their 
    results will not be surveyed here. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;More than any other Gospel 
    writer, Luke includes references to the non-Christian world of affairs. Almost 
    every incident of this kind that he mentions turns up somewhere in Josephus' 
    narratives.&quot; &#151;&#151; Mason, p. 205 </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among these stories or facts (and 
    Mason only mentions some of many) are: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The census under Quirinius (Luke 
    3:1; JW 2.117-8, JA 18.1-8). The census under Quirinius is notable for three 
    reasons. First, Josephus uses the census as a key linchpin in his story, the 
    beginning of the wicked faction of Jews that would bring down Judaea (and 
    the temple), whereas Luke transvalues this message by making this census the 
    linchpin for God's salvation for the world, namely the birth of Christ (which 
    also would result in destruction of the temple) [7]. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, no other author did or 
    was even likely to have seen this census as particularly noteworthy--Josephus 
    alone uses it as an excuse for him to introduce his villains, a group that 
    scholars doubt existed as a unified faction--and therefore it is perhaps more 
    than coincidence that it should appear as a key event elsewhere, even more 
    so since only Josephus, precisely because of his apologetic aim, associates 
    the census with Judas the Galilean, and thus it is peculiar that Luke should 
    do so as well. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third, Matthew does not mention 
    anything about it in his account of the nativity, thus one is left to wonder 
    where Luke learned of it. Given the first two points, the answer could be 
    that Luke borrowed the idea from Josephus, and therefore it probably does 
    not come from any genuine tradition about Jesus. Finally, it is most unlikely 
    that Josephus got the information from Luke, for Josephus provides much more 
    detailed, and more correct information (e.g. he knows exactly when and why 
    the census happened, that the census was only of Judaea, not the whole world, 
    etc.), such that it is far more likely that Luke was drawing upon and simplifying 
    Josephus than that Josephus was expanding on Luke [8]. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Felix sending priests, &quot;excellent 
    men,&quot; to Rome for trial on petty charges (Life 13) Could this have been 
    Luke's pretext or model for having the same thing happen to Paul? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Religion as Philosophy...Mason 
    concludes with one overriding similarity of tactic between L and J that is 
    unlikely to have been independently devised: both very cleverly paint their 
    religions as respectable Graeco-Jewish philosophical schools. Some of these 
    features: L begins by asserting that Christian teachings were &quot;handed 
    down&quot; (paradid&ocirc;mi) by eye-witnesses of Jesus, just as J emphasizes 
    that Jewish teachings were &quot;handed down&quot; (paradid&ocirc;mi) by Moses, 
    and by the fathers of Pharisees. In both cases, the authors are drawing on 
    Greek ideas of handing down succession in philosophical schools. Thus, both 
    L and J are portraying their religion as traditional and philosophical (though 
    the concept also has precedents in Paul). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">L calls the Pharisees the &quot;most 
    precise school&quot; (Acts 26:5) </font>(the KJV says: &quot;the straightest 
    sect&quot;)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, yet no one else but 
    Josephus uses this idiom (JW 1.110, 2.162; JA 17.41; Life 189). Finally, L 
    curiously never mentions the third school, the Essenes. Yet Josephus praised 
    them above all. They also happened to be much like Christians in many respects. 
    Mason advances the hypothesis that Luke intended the Christians to take the 
    place of the Essenes--and certainly wanted to avoid competing with them--so 
    that Christianity would appear to Roman readers as this very third school: 
    the most like Greek philosophy, the most like Christianity, and the most praised 
    by Josephus. We lack the data necessary to prove or refute this hypothesis, 
    but it is worth considering in light of all the evidence so far. It certainly 
    fits. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conclusion...Luke almost certainly 
    knew and drew upon the works of Josephus (or else an amazing series of coincidences 
    remains in want of an explanation), and therefore Luke and Acts were written 
    at the end of the 1st century, or perhaps the beginning of the 2nd. This also 
    results in the realization that almost every famous person, institution, place 
    or event mentioned in L that can be checked against other sources is also 
    found in Josephus, so that efforts to prove the veracity of L by appealing 
    to these checks is cut short by the fact that he appears to have gotten all 
    this information from Josephus, and simply cut-and-pasted it into his own 
    &quot;history&quot; in order to give his story an air of authenticity and 
    realism. He could thus, for all we know, have been writing historical fiction--using 
    real characters and places, and putting them in fictional situations, all 
    dressed up as history--history with a message, and an apologetic purpose. 
    We thus cannot really know what in L is true or false with regard to the origins 
    of Christianity or the actions of early Christians, since these particular 
    details are the most prone to manipulation for didactic, symbolic, politico-ecclesiastical 
    and apologetic reasons, and have very little if any external corroboration 
    (and no external corroboration from a non-Christian). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Josephus, as we shall discover, has indeed become an adept 
  in the Christian mysteries, and a collaborator in the story of Christ, and like 
  the authers of the Gospels he is concealing as much in his narratives as he 
  is revealing. He too is weaving two stories together, one inside the other. 
  He is not, however, so much a collaborator in the story of Christ as he is in 
  the story of Paul (and thus the connections many see between his writings and 
  Luke, the disciple of Paul). He weaves himself into the story, and in a very 
  cryptic sense becomes a ghost writer for Paul himself. He has continued access 
  to the <i>fellowship of mystery</i> (Ephesians 3:9), and will lace his own writings 
  with allegorical and otherwise suprahistorical accounts of those things the 
  fellowship is concealing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And so in every historical account we must </font><font size="+1">look 
  deeper into Josephus's narratives. They are a blend of history and initiation. 
  To see inside of these accounts the initiate must pay close attention to the 
  &quot;tenor&quot; of the narratives, to the catch-words and phrases, studying 
  them for their double usage, or for their epic application. For instance, when 
  Josephus is describing the wars that ensued after the death of Alexander, between 
  his successors the Antiochans and the Ptolemies (Antiquities XI and onwards), 
  dividing Israel and Judah between them, we immediately visualize events confined 
  to that land that lies between Syria and Egypt in the Middle East. But a great 
  part of these wars were fought in Europe. Antiochus Soter (Savior) did not only 
  engage the Gauls but so did his successors advance into Europe on other occasions--to 
  engage the forces of Egypt who, under their several Ptolemies, and who, &quot;with 
  their 15,000 ships,&quot; controlled not only Greece but the whole region around 
  Thrace and Macedonia. It was not simply from Palestine that Jews were removed 
  into Egypt but from Europe as well. Josephus does not come right out and say 
  it because as we see, he is both revealing and concealing these things at the 
  same time...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the same way he allows his accounts of the Maccabees to 
  slip right out of Europe to the East via Samothrace (or Samaria as the prophets 
  knew the entire region) without raising a hint. Which is why he is always saying 
  tch, tch! to the other historians of his time. They simply did not know how 
  to record sacred history. Which, of course, is also why other historians are 
  always taking Josephus to task for not always having his facts straight. When 
  Josephus calls the Hasmonean, Alexander, &quot;a Thracian among the Jews&quot; 
  (Antiquities XIII.IV.2), Whiston does not realize that Josephus really means 
  it. Whiston says: &quot;This name Thracida which the Jews gave to Alexander 
  must denote 'as barbarous as a Thracian, or somewhat like it.'&quot; He cannot 
  realize that Josephus has followed the course of these events, along with the 
  movements of the Celto-Thracian-Jewish tribes themselves, as they moved through 
  all of these upheavals out of Europe into Asia-Minor, and subsequently into 
  Palestine. The entire East was speaking Greek, and it was all in motion:</font></p>

    50:1-21).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">William Whiston, a translator of the Works of Josephus into 
  English, says that Josephus &quot;was not thoroughly acquainted with several 
  circumstances of history from the days of Antiochus Epiphanes to his own...and 
  so committed many involuntary errors therein.&quot; The matter at hand had to 
  do with an alleged visit by Alexander the Great to the temple in Jerusalem, 
  upon which he was met by this Simeon, or a Jaddua, or some other priestly figure 
  of legendary stature. In an article on Alexander the Great the Encyclopedia 
  Judaica states:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The legend in Josephus ascribes 
    to Alexander things which are highly improbable. After the battle of Issus, 
    Alexander set out hurriedly for Egypt in order to dislodge the Persians from 
    the Mediterranean coast. The siege of Tyre was protracted and Alexander had 
    no time to turn aside from his man route in order to visit a city as unimportant 
    as Jerusalem was then </font>(which is altogether true)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    or the Jews, who were a small nation. It is obvious that Alexander advanced 
    with his army along the coasts and did not then visit the interior of the 
    country.&quot;...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The author of this article is correct, but how would he or 
  she know if Alexander did or did not visit that place? If that city in Palestine 
  really was the focus of God's Eye in the world why wouldn't Alexander want to 
  turn aside for the mere two hours it would take to get there, to visit it? The 
  article, of course, also hangs on the assumption that that land there in Palestine, 
  is actually the &quot;land of Israel,&quot; and that it is a territory of some 
  vaster (or greater interior) proportions than it really is. Josephus, nevertheless 
  (not to confuse that event with the real event), has one Jaddua, the high Priest, 
  coming out to meet Alexander. Talmudic legends, not understanding what they 
  are reporting, or the meaning of the tradition they have preserved and handed 
  down, say it was Simeon the Just:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;People came and informed 
    Simeon the Just. What did he do? He put on his priestly garments, and he and 
    some of the nobles of Israel who carried burning torches in their hands walked 
    all night, some on one side, others on the other, until Dawn. When dawn arose, 
    he (Alexander) said, 'Who are these?'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They answered&quot; 'The Jews who 
    rebelled against you.' When he reached Antipatras, and the Sun shone, they 
    met. On seeing Simeon the Just, Alexander descended from his chariot, and 
    prostrated himself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They said to him: 'Should a great 
    king like you prostrate yourself before the Jews?' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He answered, 'The image of this 
    man wins my battles for me.'&quot; </font>Encyclopedia Judaica<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This, however, is what Ptolemy, one of Alexander's generals 
  and the future king of Egypt, relates of the matter:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;...Too shrewd to pursue horsemen 
    as they escaped over the Romanian plains, they set up their own standards 
    on the edge of the river and spread the news that a Macedonian prince had 
    advance to the extreme northern frontier of the Greek world and meant to keep 
    it. This message must have counted as something of a sensation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There came, from all corners, barbarian 
    chiefs to visit the young man challenging them in their own sphere. One even 
    came from the upper Danube, and his visit won him a place, albeit anonymous, 
    in history. Alexander probably received him with especial curiosity. As a 
    reader of Herodotus he was well aware that the Danube rises in the land of 
    the Celts. The man thus belonged to a people about whom he must have at least 
    heard reports and with whom his western subjects, on the Albanian coast, must 
    have had some contact for many years. Moreover, as his biographers rarely 
    omit to mention, Alexander's father had been slain by a Celtic dagger...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Alexander discussed with him, 
    and in what language, we do not know. Only Ptolemy, a friend of the young 
    king, has recorded parts of the conversation for posterity. Alexander, he 
    reports, asked the Celt what his people most feared, 'naturally in the hope 
    that he would reply that it was himself.&quot; But the answer was unexpected. 
    The Celt tersely replied that they feared nothing so much as the possibility 
    'THAT THE HEAVENS MIGHT FALL ON THEIR HEADS.' His words must have impressed 
    the officers present in the tent more than we can understand...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There must have been more to it. 
    Ptolemy could still remember the Celt's answer when, thirty years later, and 
    long since king of Egypt, he dictated a biography of his dead sovereign...Modern 
    scholars have puzzled over this enigmatic reply until it became clear that 
    what seemed rash revealed an attitude to life that was shared by peoples of 
    similar spirit, such as the Achean Greeks, the heroes of Homer...This in turn 
    leads one to suppose that the Celt had uttered words that were, to him, tremendously 
    important and therefore struck a common chord in the leader of the half-savage 
    Macedonians.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We may assume that Alexander must 
    have been moved. The young ruler, already in the process of conquering half 
    the world, was learning in his career that there were men who respected no 
    material barriers, recognizing only the limitations that fate imposed. In 
    his situation this must have affected him almost like an omen.&quot; </font>The

    'The Place,' meaning the 'All Present.' The term 'Our Father who is in Heaven'

  father and mother; and I made mighty proficiency in the improvements of my learning, 
  and appeared to have BOTH A GREAT MEMORY AND UNDERSTANDING. Moreover, when I 
  was a child, and about fourteen years of age, I was commended by all for the 
  love I had to learning; on which account the high priests and principal men 
  of the city came then frequently to me together, in order to know my opinion 
  about the accurate understanding of points of the law. And when I was about 
  sixteen years old, I had a mind to make trim of the several sects that were 
  among us. THESE SECTS ARE THREE: - The first is the PHARISEES, the second that 
  SADDUCEES, and the third that of the ESSENES, as we have frequently told you; 
  FOR I THOUGHT that by this means I MIGHT CHOOSE THE BEST, if I were once acquainted 
  with them all; so I contented myself with hard fare, and underwent great difficulties, 
  and went through them all. Nor did I content myself with these trials only; 
  but when I was informed that one, whose name was Banus, lived in the desert, 
  and used no other clothing than grew upon trees, and had no other food than 
  what grew of its own accord, and bathed himself in cold water frequently, both 
  by night and by day, in order to preserve his chastity, I imitated him in those 
  things, and continued with him three years. (3) So when I had accomplished my 
  desires, I returned back to the city, being now nineteen years old, and began 
  to conduct myself according to the rules of the sect of the Pharisees, which 
  is of kin to the sect of the Stoics, as the Greeks call them. </p>
<p>3. But when I was in the twenty-sixth year of my age, it happened that I TOOK 
  A VOYAGE TO ROME, and this on the occasion which I shall now describe. AT THE 
  TIME WHEN FELIX WAS PROCURATOR OF JUDEA THERE WERE CERTAIN PRIESTS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE, 
  AND VERY EXCELLENT PERSONS THEY WERE, WHOM ON A TRIFLING OCCASION HE HAD PUT 
  IN BONDS, AND SENT TO ROME TO PLEAD THEIR CAUSE BEFORE CAESAR. <b>(compare Acts 
  24 to 26)</b>. These I was desirous to procure deliverance for, and that especially 
  because I was informed that they were not unmindful of piety towards God, even 
  under their afflictions, but supported themselves with figs and nuts. (4) Accordingly 
  I came to Rome, THOUGH IT WERE THROUGH A GREAT NUMBER OF HAZARDS BY SEA;FOR 
  AS OUR SHIP WAS DROWNED IN THE ADRIATIC SEA, WE THAT WERE IN IT, BEING ABOUT 
  SIX HUNDRED IN NUMBER, (5) swam for our lives all the night; when, upon the 
  first appearance of the day, and upon our sight of a ship of Cyrene, I and some 
  others, eighty in all, by God's providence, prevented the rest, and were taken 
  up into the other ship. And when I had thus escaped, and was come to Dieearchia, 
  WHICH THE ITALIANS CALL PUTEOLI <b>(Acts 28:11-14)</b> I became acquainted with 
  Aliturius, an actor of plays, and much beloved by Nero, but a Jew by birth; 
  and through his interest became known to Poppea, Caesar's wife, and took care, 
  as soon as possible, to entreat her to procure that the priests might be set 
  at liberty. And when, besides this favor, I had obtained many presents from 
  Poppea, I returned home again. </p>
<p>4. AND NOW I PERCEIVED INNOVATIONS WERE ALREADY BEGUN, and that there were 
  a great many very much elevated in hopes of a revolt from the Romans. I therefore 
  endeavored to put a stop to these tumultuous persons, and persuaded them to 
  change their minds; AND LAID BEFORE THEIR EYES AGAINST WHOM IT WAS THAT THEY 
  WERE GOING TO FIGHT <b>(Moscow the Third Rome = Rome the First Moscow)</b>, 
  and told them that they were inferior to the Romans not only in martial skill, 
  but also in good fortune; and desired them not rashly, and after the most foolish 
  manner, to bring on the dangers of the most terrible mischiefs upon their country, 
  upon their families, and upon themselves. And this I said with vehement exhortation, 
  BECAUSE I SAW THAT THE END OF SUCH A WAR WOULD BE MOST UNFORTUNATE FOR US. But 
  I COULD NOT PERSUADE THEM; FOR THE MADNESS OF DESPARATE MEN WAS QUITE TOO HARD 
  FOR ME. <b>(Romans 13:1-7)</b>.</p>
<p>5. I was then afraid, lest, by inculcating these things so often, I should 
  incur their hatred and their suspicions, as if I were of our enemies' party, 
  and should run into the danger of being seized by them, and slain; since they 
  were already possessed of Antonia, which was the citadel; SO I RETIRED INTO 
  THE INNER COURT OF THE TEMPLE. Yet did I go out of the temple again, after Manahem 
  and the principal of the band of robbers were put to death, WHEN I ABODE AMONG 
  THE HIGH PRIESTS AND THE CHIEF OF THE PHARISEES. <b>(Philippians 3:1-8)</b>. 
  But no small fear seized upon us when we saw the people in arms, while we ourselves 
  knew not what we should do, and were not able to restrain the seditious. However, 
  as the danger was directly upon us, we pretended that we were of the same opinion 
  with them, but only advised them to be quiet for the present, and to let the 
  enemy go away, still hoping that Gessius [Florus] would not be long ere he came, 
  and that with great forces, and so put an end to these seditious proceedings. 
</p>
<p>6. But, upon his coming and fighting, he was beaten, and a great many of those 
  that were with him fell. And this disgrace which Gessius [with Cestius] received, 
  became the calamity OF OUR WHOLE NATION; for those that were fond of the war 
  were so far elevated with this success, that they had hopes of finally conquering 
  the Romans. Of which war another occasion was ministered; which was this: - 
  Those that dwelt in THE NEIGHBORING CITIES OF SYRIA seized upon such Jews as 
  dwelt among them, with their wives and children, and slew them, when they had 
  not the least occasion of complaint against them; for they did neither attempt 
  any innovation or revolt from the Romans, nor had they given any marks of hatred 
  or treacherous designs towards the Syrians. But what was done by THE INHABITANTS 
  OF SCYTHOPOLIS was the most impious and most highly criminal of all; (6) for 
  when the Jews their enemies came upon them from without, they forced the Jews 
  that were among them to BEAR ARMS against their own countrymen, WHICH IT IS 
  UNLAWFUL FOR US TO DO; (7) and when, by their assistance, they had joined battle 
  with those who attacked them, and had beaten them, after that victory they forgot 
  the assurances they had given these their fellow citizens and confederates, 
  and slew them all, being in number many ten thousands [13,000]. The like miseries 
  were undergone by those Jews that were the inhabitants OF DAMASCUS. But we have 
  given a more accurate account of these things in the books of the Jewish war. 
  I only mention them now, because I would demonstrate to my readers, that the 
  Jews' war with the Romans was not voluntary, but that, for the main, they were 
  forced by necessity to enter into it. </p>
<p>7. So when Gessius had been beaten, as we have said already, the principal 
  men of Jerusalem, seeing that the robbers and innovators had arms in great plenty, 
  and fearing lest they, while they were unprovided of arms, should be in subjection 
  to their enemies, which also came to be the case afterward; and, being informed 
  that ALL GALILEE had not yet revolted from the Romans, but that some part of 
  it was still quiet; they sent me and two others of the priests, who were men 
  of excellent characters, Joazar and Judas, IN ORDER TO PERSUADE THE ILL MEN 
  THERE TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS, AND TO TEACH THEM THIS LESSON, - THAT IT WERE 
  BETTER TO HAVE OUR ARMS RESERVED FOR THE MOST COURAGEOUS MEN THAT THE NATION 
  HAD ([than to be kept there]; FOR IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED, THAT THOSE OUR BEST 
  MEN SHOULD ALWAYS THEIR ARMS READY AGAINST FUTURITY <b>(see <i>The Wars of the 
  Sons of Light and the Sons of Darkness</i> in the Dead Sea Scriptures; 2 Corinthians 
  10:3-6 and Ephesians 6:10-17)</b>; but still so, that they should wait to see 
  what the Romans would do.</p>

</p>
<p align="center"><b>GALILEE, THE CIRCLE OF THE NATIONS (THE GREAT WHEEL OF GENESIS)</b></p>
<p>8. When I had therefore received these instructions, I CAME INTO GALILEE, and 
  found the people of SEPPHORIS in no small agony about their country, by reason 
  that the Galileans had resolved to plunder it, on account of the friendship 
  they had with the Romans, and because they had given their right hand, and made 
  a league with Cestius Gallus, the president of Syria. But I delivered them all 
  out of the fear they were in, and persuaded the multitude to deal kindly with 
  them, and permitted them to send to those that were their own hostages with 
  Gessius to Dora, which is a city of Phoenicia, as often as they pleased; though 
  I still found the inhabitants of Tiberias ready to take arms, and that on the 
  occasion following: - </p>
<p>9. There were three factions in this city. The first was composed of men of 
  worth and gravity; of these Julius Capellus was the head. Now he, as well as 
  all his companions, Herod the son of Miarus, and Herod the son of Gamalus, and 
  Compsus the son of Compsus; (for as to Compsus's brother Crispus, who had once 
  been governor of the city under the great king [Agrippa] (8) HE WAS BEYOND JORDAN 
  in his own possessions;) all these persons before named gave their advice, that 
  the city should then continue in their allegiance to the Romans and to the king. 
  But Pistus, who was guided by his son Justus, did not acquiesce in that resolution; 
  otherwise he was himself naturally of a good and virtuous character. BUT THE 
  SECOND FACTION was composed of the most ignoble persons, and WAS DETERMINED 
  FOR WAR. But as for JUSTUS, THE SON OF PISTUS, who was the head OF THE THIRD 
  FACTION, although he pretended to be doubtful about going to war, yet was he 
  really desirous of innovation, as supposing that he should gain power to himself 
  by the change of affairs. He therefore came into the midst of them, and endeavored 
  to inform the multitude that &quot;the city Tiberius had ever been a city of 
  Galilee, and that in the days of Herod the tetrarch, who had built it, it had 
  obtained the principal place, and that he had ordered that the city Sepphoris 
  should be subordinate to the city Tiberias; that they had not lost this preeminence 
  even under Agrippa the father, but had retained it until Felix was procurator 
  of Judea. But he told them, that now they had been so unfortunate as to be made 
  a present by Nero to Agrippa, junior; and that, upon SEPPHORIS's submission 
  of itself to the Romans, THAT WAS BECOME THE CAPITAL CITY OF GALILEE...</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg152.gif" width="480" height="169"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Sepphoris, Ten Sefirot</b></p>
<p> ...AND THAT THE ROYAL LIBRARY AND THE ARCHIVES WERE NOW REMOVED FROM THEM.&quot; 
  When he had spoken these things, and a great many more, against king Agrippa, 
  in order to provoke the people to a revolt, he added that &quot;this was the 
  time for them to take arms, and join with the Galileans as their confederates 
  (whom they might command, and who would now willingly assist them, OUT OF THE 
  HATRED THEY BARE TO THE PEOPLE OF SEPPHORIS; because they preserved their fidelity 
  to the Romans), and to gather a great number of forces, in order to punish them.&quot; 
  And as he said this, he exhorted the multitude [to go to war;] for his abilities 
  lay in making harangues to the people, and in being too hard in his speeches 
  for such as opposed him, though they advised what was more to their advantage, 
  AND THIS BY HIS CRAFTINESS AND HIS FALLACIES, for he was not unskilful in the 
  learning of the Greeks; and in dependence on that skill it was, that he undertook 
  to write a history of these affairs, as aiming, by this way of haranguing, to 
  disguise the truth. But as to this man, and how ill were his character and conduct 
  of life, and how he and his brother were, in great measure, the authors of our 
  destruction, I shall give the reader an account in the progress of my narration. 
  So when Justus had, by his persuasions, prevailed with the citizens of Tiberias 
  to take arms, nay, and had forced a great many so to do against their wills, 
  he went out, and set the villages that belonged to Gadara and Hippos on fire; 
  which villages were situated on the borders of Tiberias, and of the region of 
  Scythopolis. </p>
<p>10. And this was the state Tiberias was now in. But as for Gischala, its affairs 
  were thus: - When John, the son of Levi, saw some of the citizens much elevated 
  upon their revolt from the Romans, he labored to restrain them, and entreated 
  them that they would keep their allegiance to them. But he could not gain his 
  purpose, although he did his endeavors to the utmost; for the neighboring people 
  of Gadara, Gabara, and Sogana, wth the Tyrians, got together a great army, and 
  fell upon Gischala, and took Gischala by force, and set it on fire; and when 
  they had entirely demolished it, they returned home. Upon which John was so 
  enraged, that he armed all his men, and joined battle with the people forementioned; 
  and rebuilt Gischala after a manner better than before, and fortified it with 
  walls for its future security. </p>
<p>11. But Gamala persevered in its allegiance to the Romans, for the reason following: 
  - Philip, the son of Jacimus, who was their governor under king Agrippa, had 
  been unexpectedly preserved when the royal palace at Jerusalem had been besieged; 
  but, as he fled away, had fallen into another danger, and that was, OF BEING 
  KILLED BY MANAHEM, AND THE ROBBERS THAT WERE WITH HIM <b>(Daniel 11:14)</b>; 
  but certain BABYLONIANS, who were of his kindred, and WERE THEN IN JERUSALEM, 
  hindered the robbers from executing their design. So Philip staid there four 
  days, and fled away on the fifth, having disguised himself with fictitious hair, 
  that he might not be discovered; and when he was come to one of the villages 
  to him belonging, but one that was situated at the borders of the citadel of 
  Gamala, he sent to some of those that were under him, and commanded them to 
  come to him. But God himself hindered that his intention, and this for his own 
  advantage also; for had it not so happened, he had certainly perished. For a 
  fever having seized upon him immediately, he wrote to Agrippa and Bernice, and 
  gave them to one of his freed-men to carry them to Varus, who at this time was 
  procurator of the kingdom, which the king and his sister had intrusted him withal, 
  while they were gone to Berytus with an intention of meeting Gessius. When Varus 
  had received these letters of Philip, and had learned that he was preserved, 
  he was very uneasy at it, as supposing that he should appear useless to the 
  king and his sister, now Philip was come. He therefore produced the carrier 
  of the letters before the multitude, and accused him of forging the same; and 
  said that he spake falsely when he related that Philip was at Jerusalem, fighting 
  among the Jews against the Romans. So he slew him. And when this freed-man of 
  Philip did not return again, Philip was doubtful what should be the occasion 
  of his stay, and sent a second messenger with letters, that he might, upon his 
  return, inform him what had befallen the other that had been sent before, and 
  why he tarried so long. Varus accused this messenger also, when he came, of 
  telling a falsehood, and slew him. For he was puffed up by the Syrians that 
  were at Caesarea, and had great expectations; for they said that Agrippa would 
  be slain by the Romans for the crimes which the Jews had committed, and that 
  he should himself take the government, as derived from their kings; for Varus 
  was, by the confession of all, of the royal family, as being a descendant of 
  Sohemus, who had enjoyed a tetrarchy about Libanus; for which reason it was 
  that he was puffed up, and kept the letters to himself. He contrived, also, 
  that the king should not meet with those writings, by guarding all the passes, 
  lest any one should escape, and inform the king what had been done. He moreover 
  slew many of the Jews, in order to gratify the Syrians of Cesarea. He had a 
  mind also to join with the Trachonites in Batanea, and to take up arms and make 
  an assault upon the Babylonian Jews that were AT ECBATANA; for that was the 
  name they went by. He therefore called to him TWELVE of the Jews of Cesarea, 
  of the best character, and ordered them to go to Ecbatana, and inform their 
  countrymen who dwelt there, That Varus hath heard that &quot;you intend to march 
  against the king; but, not believing that report, he hath sent us to persuade 
  you to lay down your arms, and that this compliance will be a sign that he did 
  well not to give credit to those that raised the report concerning you.&quot; 
  He also enjoined them to send SEVENTY of their principal men to make a defense 
  for them as to the accusation laid against them. So when the twelve messengers 
  came to their countrymen at Ecbatana, and found that they had no designs of 
  innovation at all, they persuaded them to send the seventy men also; who, not 
  at all suspecting what would come, sent them accordingly. So these seventy went 
  down to Caesarea, together with the twelve ambassadors; where Varus met them 
  with the king's forces, and slew them all, together with the [twelve] (9) ambassadors, 
  and made an expedition against the Jews of Ecbatana. But one there was of the 
  seventy who escaped, and made haste to inform the Jews of their coming; upon 
  which they took their arms, with their wives and children, and retired to the 
  citadel at Gamala, leaving their own villages full of all sorts of good things, 
  and having MANY TEN THOUSANDS OF CATTLE <b>(?)</b>. When Philip was informed 
  of these things, he also came to the citadel of Gamala; and when he was come, 
  the multitude cried aloud, and desired him to resume the government, and to 
  make an expedition against Varus, and the Syrians of Cesarea; for it was reported 
  that they had slain the king. But Philip restrained their zeal, and put them 
  in mind of the benefits the king had bestowed upon them; and told them how powerful 
  the Romans were, and said it was not for their advantage to make war with them; 
  and at length he prevailed with them. But now, when the king was acquainted 
  with Varus's design, which was to cut off the Jews of Caesarea, being many ten 
  thousands, with their wives and children, and all in one day, he called to him 
  Equiculus Modius, and sent him to be Varus's successor, as we have elsewhere 
  related. But still Philip kept possession of the citadel of Gamala, and of the 
  country adjoining to it, which thereby continued in their allegiance to the 
  Romans. </p>
<p>12. Now, as soon as I was come into Galilee, and had learned this state of 
  things by the information of such as told me of them, I wrote TO THE SANHEDRIM 
  AT JERUSALEM about them, AND REQUIRED THEIR DIRECTION WHAT I SHOULD DO. Their 
  direction was, that I should continue there, and that, if my fellow legates 
  were willing, I should join with them in the care of Galilee. But those my fellow 
  legates, having gotten great riches from those tithes which as priests were 
  their dues, and were given to them, determined to return to their own country. 
  Yet when I desired them to stay so long, that we might first settle the public 
  affairs, they complied with me. So I removed, together with them, from the city 
  of Sepphoris, and came to a certain village called Bethmaus, four furlongs distant 
  from Tiberius; and thence I sent messengers to the senate of Tiberius, and desired 
  that the principal men of the city would come to me: and when they were come, 
  Justus himself being also with them, I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS SENT TO THEM BY 
  THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM AS A LEGATE, TOGETHER WITH THESE OTHER PRIESTS, in order 
  to persuade them TO DEMOLISH THAT HOUSE WHICH HEROD THE TETRARCH HAD BUILT THERE, 
  and which had the figures of living creatures in it, although our laws have 
  forbidden us to make any such figures; and I desired that they would give us 
  leave so to do immediately. But for a good while Capellus and the principal 
  men belonging to the city would not give us leave, but were at length entirely 
  overcome by us, and were induced to be of our opinion. So Jesus the son of Sapphias, 
  one of those whom we have already mentioned as the leader of a seditious tumult 
  of mariners and poor people, prevented us, and took with him certain Galileans, 
  and set the entire palace on fire, and thought he should get a great deal of 
  money thereby, because he saw some of the roofs gilt with gold. They also plundered 
  a great deal of the furniture, which was done without our approbation; for after 
  we had discoursed with Capellus and the principal men of the city, we departed 
  from Bethmaus, AND WENT INTO THE UPPER GALILEE. But Jesus and his party slew 
  all the Greeks that were inhabitants of Tiberias, and as many others as were 
  their enemies before the war began. </p>
<p>13. When I understood this state of things, I was greatly provoked, and went 
  down to Tiberias, and took all the care I could of the royal furniture, to recover 
  all that could be recovered from such as had plundered it. They consisted of 
  candlesticks made of Corinthian brass, and of royal tables, and of a great quantity 
  of uncoined silver; and I resolved to preserve whatsoever came to my hand for 
  the king. So I sent for ten of the principal men of the senate, and for Capellus 
  the son of Antyllus, and committed the furniture to them, with this charge, 
  That they should part with it to nobody else but to myself. From thence I and 
  my fellow legates went to Gichala, to John, as desirous to know his intentions, 
  and soon saw that he was for innovations, and had a mind to the principality; 
  for he desired me to give him authority to carry off that corn which belonged 
  to Caesar, and lay in the villages of Upper Galilee; and he pretended that he 
  would expend what it came to in building the walls of his own city. But when 
  I perceived what he endeavored at, and what he had in his mind, I said I would 
  not permit him so to do; for that I thought either to keep it for the Romans 
  or for myself, now I was intrusted with the public affairs there by the people 
  of Jerusalem. But, when he was not able to prevail with me, he betook himself 
  to my fellow legates; for they had no sagacity in providing for futurity, and 
  were very ready to take bribes. So he corrupted them with money to decree, THAT 
  ALL THE CORN THAT WAS WITHIN HIS PROVINCE should be delivered to him; while 
  I, who was but one, was outvoted by two, and held my tongue. Then did John introduce 
  another cunning contrivance of his; for he said that those Jews who inhabited 
  Cesarea Philippi, and were shut up by the order of the king's deputy there, 
  had sent to him to desire him, that, SINCE THEY HAD NO OIL THAT WAS PURE FOR 
  THEIR USE, he would provide a sufficient quantity of such oil for them, lest 
  they should be forced to make use of oil that came from the Greeks, and thereby 
  transgress their own laws. Now this was said by John, not out of his regard 
  to religion, but out of his most flagrant desire of gain; for he knew that two 
  sextaries were sold with them of Caesarea for one drachma, but that at Gischala 
  fourscore sextaxies were sold for four sextaries. So he gave order that all 
  the oil which was there should be carried away, as having my permission for 
  so doing; which yet I did not grant him voluntarily, but only out of fear of 
  the multitude, since, if I had forbidden him, I should have been stoned by them. 
  When I had therefore permitted this to be done by John, he gained vast sums 
  of money by this his knavery. </p>
<p>14. But when I had dismissed my fellow legates, and sent them back to Jerusalem, 
  I took care to have arms provided, and the cities fortified. And when I had 
  sent for the most hardy among the robbers, I saw that it was not in my power 
  to take their arms from them; but I persuaded the multitude to allow them money 
  as pay, and told them it was better for them to give them a little willingly, 
  rather than to [be forced to] overlook them when they plundered their goods 
  from them. And when I had obliged them to take an oath not to come into that 
  country, unless they were invited to come, or else when they had not their pay 
  given them, I dismissed them, and charged them neither to make an expedition 
  against the Romans, nor against those their neighbors that lay round about them; 
  FOR MY FIRST CARE WAS TO KEEP GALILEE IN PEACE. So I was willing to have the 
  principal of the Galileans, IN ALL SEVENTY, as hostages for their fidelity, 
  but still under the notion of friendship. Accordingly, I made them my friends 
  and companions as I journeyed, and set them to judge causes; and with their 
  approbation it was that I gave my sentences, while I endeavored not to mistake 
  what justice required, and to keep my hands clear of all bribery in those determinations 
  <b>(compare Acts 20:22-38)</b>.. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/30Tree.gif" width="576" height="242"></p>
<p>15. I WAS NOW ABOUT THE THIRTIETH YEAR OF MY AGE; in which time of life it 
  is a hard thing for any one to escape the calumnies of the envious, although 
  he restrain himself from fulfilling any unlawful desires, ESPECIALLY WHERE A 
  PERSON IS IN GREAT AUTHORITY. Yet did I preserve every woman free from injuries; 
  and as to what presents were offered me, I despised them, as not standing in 
  need of them. Nor indeed would I take those tithes, which were due to me as 
  a priest, from those that brought them. Yet do I confess, that I took part of 
  the spoils of those Syrians which inhabited the cities that adjoined to us, 
  when I had conquered them, AND THAT I SENT THEM TO MY KINDRED AT JERUSALEM; 
  although, when I twice took Sepphoris by force, and Tiberias four times, and 
  Gadara once, and when I had subdued and taken John, who often laid treacherous 
  snares for me, I did not punish [with death] either him or any of the people 
  forenamed, as the progress of this discourse will show. And on this account, 
  I suppose, it was that God, (10) who is never unacquainted with those that do 
  as they ought to do, DELIVERED ME STILL OUT OF THE HANDS OF MY ENEMIES, and 
  afterwards preserved me WHEN I FELL INTO THOSE MANY DANGERS WHICH I SHALL RELATE 
  HEREAFTER. </p>
<p>16. NOW THE MULTITUDE OF THE GALILEANS HAD THAT GREAT KINDNESS FOR ME, AND 
  FIDELITY TO ME, that when their cities were taken by force, and their wives 
  and children carried into slavery, they did not so deeply lament for their own 
  calamities, as they were solicitous for my preservation. But when John saw this, 
  he envied me, and wrote to me, desiring that I would give him leave to come 
  down, and make use of the hot-baths of Tiberias for the recovery of the health 
  of his body. Accordingly, I did not hinder him, as having no suspicion of any 
  wicked designs of his; and I wrote to those to whom I had committed the administration 
  of the affairs of Tiberius by name, that they should provide a lodging for John, 
  and for such as should come with him, and should procure him what necessaries 
  soever he should stand in need of. NOW AT THIS TIME MY ABODE WAS IN A VILLAGE 
  OF GALILEE, WHICH IS NAMED CANS. </p>
<p>17. But when John was come to the city of Tiberias, he persuaded the men to 
  revolt from their fidelity to me, and to adhere to him; and many of them gladly 
  received that invitation of his, as ever fond of innovations, and by nature 
  disposed to changes, and delighting in seditions; but they were chiefly Justus 
  and his father Pistus, that were earnest for their revolt from me, and their 
  adherence to John. But I came upon them, and prevented them; for a messenger 
  HAD COME TO ME FROM SILAS, whom I had made governor of Tiberias, as I have said 
  already, and had told me of the inclinations of the people of Tiberias, and 
  advised me to make haste thither; for that, if I made any delay, the city would 
  come under another's jurisdiction. Upon the receipt of this letter of Silas, 
  I took two hundred men along with me, and traveled all night, having sent before 
  a messenger TO LET THE PEOPLE of Tiberias KNOW THAT I WAS COMING TO THEM. When 
  I came near to the city, which was early in the morning, the multitude came 
  out to meet me; and John came with them, and saluted me, but in a most disturbed 
  manner, as BEING AFRAID THAT MY COMING WAS TO CALL HIM TO AN ACCOUNT for what 
  I was now sensible he was doing. So he, in great haste, went to his lodging. 
  But when I was in the open place of the city, having dismissed the guards I 
  had about me, excepting one, and ten armed men that were with him, I ATTEMPTED 
  TO MAKE A SPEECH TO THE MULTITUDE OF TIBERIUS: and, standing on a certain elevated 
  place, I entreated them not to be so hasty in their revolt; for that such a 
  change in their behavior would be to their reproach, and that they would then 
  justly be suspected by those that should be their governors hereafter, as if 
  they were not likely to be faithful to them neither. </p>
<p>18. But before I had spoken all I designed, I heard one of my own domestics 
  bidding me come down, for that it was not a proper time to take care of retaining 
  the good-will of the people of Tiberias, BUT TO PROVIDE FOR MY OWN SAFETY, AND 
  ESCAPE MY ENEMIES THERE; for John had chosen the most trusty of those armed 
  men that were about him out of those thousand that he had with him, and had 
  given them orders when he sent them, to kill me, having learned that I was alone, 
  excepting some of my domestics. So those that were sent came as they were ordered, 
  and they had executed what they came about, had I not leaped down from the elevation 
  I stood on, and with one of my guards, whose name was James, been carried [out 
  of the crowd] upon the back of one Herod of Tiberias, and guided by him down 
  to the lake, where I seized a ship, and got into it, and escaped my enemies 
  unexpectedly, and came to Tarichese. </p>
<p>19. Now, as soon as the inhabitants of that city understood the perfidiousness 
  of the people of Tiberias, they were greatly provoked at them. So they snatched 
  up their arms, and desired me to be their leader against them; for they said 
  they would avenge their commander's cause upon them. They also carried the report 
  of what had been done to me to all the Galileans, and eagerly endeavored to 
  irritate them against the people of Tiberias, and desired that vast numbers 
  of them would get together, and come to them, that they might act in concert 
  with their commander, what should be determined as fit to be done. Accordingly, 
  the GALILEANS CAME TO ME IN GREAT NUMBERS, FROM ALL PARTS, with their weapons, 
  and besought me to assault Tiberias, to take it by force, and to demolish it, 
  till it lay even with the ground, and then to make slaves of its inhabitants, 
  with their wives and children. Those that were Josephus's friends also, and 
  had escaped out of Tiberias, gave him the same advice. But I did not comply 
  with them, thinking it a terrible thing to begin a civil war among them; for 
  I thought that this contention ought not to proceed further than words; nay, 
  I told them that it was not for their own advantage to do what they would have 
  me to do, while the Romans expected no other than that we should destroy one 
  another by our mutual seditions. And by saying this, I put a stop to the anger 
  of the Galileans. </p>
<p>20. But now John was afraid for himself, since his treachery had proved unsuccessful. 
  So he took the armed men that were about him, and removed from Tiberias to Gischala, 
  and wrote to me to apologize for himself concerning What had been done, as if 
  it had been done without his approbation, and desired me to have no suspicion 
  of him to his disadvantage. He also added oaths and certain horrible curses 
  upon himself, and supposed he should be thereby believed in the points he wrote 
  about to me. </p>
<p>21. But now another great number of the Galileans came together again with 
  their weapons, as knowing the man, how wicked and how sadly perjured he was, 
  and desired me to lead them against him and promised me that they would utterly 
  both him and Gischala. Hereupon I professed that I was obliged to them for their 
  readiness to serve me, and that I would more than requite their good-will to 
  me. However, I entreated them to restrain themselves, and begged of them to 
  give me leave to do what I intended, WHICH WAS TO PUT AN END TO THESE TROUBLES 
  WITHOUT BLOODSHED; and when I had prevailed with the multitude of the Galileans 
  to let me do so, I CAME TO SEPPHORIS. </p>
<p>22. But the inhabitants of this city having determined to continue in their 
  allegiance to the Romans, were afraid of my coming to them, and tried, by putting 
  me upon another action, to divert me, that they might be freed from the terror 
  they were in. Accordingly, they sent to Jesus, the captain of those robbers 
  who were in the confines of Ptolemais, and promised to give him a great deal 
  of money, if he would come with those forces he had with him, which were in 
  number eight hundred, and fight with us. Accordingly, he complied with what 
  they desired, upon the promises they had made him, and was desirous to fall 
  upon us when we were unprepared for him, and knew nothing of his coming beforehand. 
  So he sent to me, and desired that I would give him leave to come and salute 
  me. When I had given him that leave, which I did without the least knowledge 
  of his treacherous intentions beforehand, he took his band of robbers, and made 
  haste to come to me. Yet did not this his knavery succeed well at last; for 
  as he was already nearly approaching, one of those with him deserted him, and 
  came to me, and told me what he had undertaken to do. When I was informed of 
  this, I went into the market-place, and pretended to know nothing of his treacherous 
  purpose. I took with me many Galileans that were armed, as also some of those 
  of Tiberias; and, when I had given orders that all the roads should be carefully 
  guarded, I charged the keepers of the gates to give admittance to none but Jesus, 
  when he came, with the principal of his men, and to exclude the rest; and in 
  case they aimed to force themselves in, to use stripes [in order to repel them]. 
  Accordingly, those that had received such a charge did as they were bidden, 
  and Jesus came in with a few others; and when I had ordered him to throw down 
  his arms immediately, and told him, that if he refused so to do, he was a dead 
  man, he seeing armed men standing all round about him, was terrified, and complied; 
  and as for those of his followers that were excluded, when they were informed 
  that he was seized, they ran away. I then called Jesus to me by himself, and 
  told him, that&quot; I was not a stranger to that treacherous design he had 
  against me, nor was I ignorant by whom he was sent for; that, however, I would 
  forgive him what he had done already, if he would repent of it, and be faithful 
  to me hereafter.&quot; And thus, upon his promise to do all that I desired, 
  I let him go, and gave him leave to get those whom he had formerly had with 
  him together again. BUT I THREATENED THE INHABITANTS OF SEPPHORIS, THAT IF THEY 
  WOULD NOT LEAVE OFF THEIR UNGRATEFUL TREATMENT OF ME, I WOULD PUNISH THEM SUFFICIENTLY..</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>(Josephus seems to have departed from Paul's secret doctrines here, unless 
    we are caught up in the middle of stern warning of future events...2 Corinthians 
    12:20 to 13:2)</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>23. At this time it was that two great men, who were under the jurisdiction 
  of the king [Agrippa] came to me out of the region of Trachonius, bringing their 
  horses and their arms, and carrying with them their money also; AND WHEN THE 
  JEWS WOULD FORCE THEM TO BE CIRCUMCISED, if they would stay among them, I WOULD 
  NOT PERMIT THEM to have any force put upon them, (11) but said to them, &quot;EVERY 
  ONE OUGHT TO WORSHIP GOD ACCORDING TO HIS OWN INCLINATIONS, AND NOT TO BE CONSTRAINED 
  BY FORCE; AND THAT THESE MEN, WHO HAD FLED TO US FOR PROTECTION, OUGHT NOT TO 
  BE TREATED AS TO REPENT OF THEIR COMING HITHER.&quot; <b>(Compare Galatians 
  2:1-9)</b>. And when I had pacified the multitude, I provided for the men that 
  were come to us whatsoever it was they wanted, according to their usual way 
  of living, and that in great plenty also. </p>
<p>24. Now king Agrippa sent an army to make themselves masters of the citadel 
  of Gamala, and over it Equieulus Modius; but the forces that were sent were 
  not allow to encompass the citadel quite round, but lay before it in the open 
  places, and besieged it. But when Ebutius the decurion, who was intrusted with 
  the government of the great plain, heard that I was at Simonias, A VILLAGE SITUATED 
  IN THE CONFINES OF GALILEE, and was distant from him sixty furlongs, he took 
  a hundred horsemen that were with him by night, and a certain number of footmen, 
  about two hundred, and brought the inhabitants of the city Gibea along with 
  him as auxiliaries, and marched in the night, and came to the village where 
  I abode. Upon this I pitched my camp over against him, which had a great number 
  of forces in it: but Ebutius TRIED TO DRAW US DOWN INTO THE PLAIN, as greatly 
  depending upon his horsemen; but we would not come down; for when I was satisfied 
  of the advantage that his horse would have if we came down into the plain, WHILE 
  WE WERE ALL FOOTMEN, I RESOLVED TO JOIN BATTLE WITH THE ENEMY WHERE I WAS. Now 
  Ebutius and his party made a courageous opposition for some time; but when he 
  saw that his horse were useless to him in that place, he retired back to the 
  city Gibea, having lost three of his men in the fight. So I followed him directy 
  with two thousand armed men; and when I was at the city Besara, that lay in 
  the confines of Ptolemais, but twenty furlongs from Gibea, where Ebutius abode, 
  I placed my armed men on the outside of the village, and gave orders that they 
  should guard the passes with great care, that the enemy might not disturb us 
  until we should have carried off the corn, a great quantity of which lay there: 
  it belonged to Bernice the queen, and had been gathered together out of the 
  neighboring villages into Besara; so I LOADED MY CAMELS AND ASSES, A GREAT NUMBER 
  OF WHICH I HAD BROUGHT ALONG WITH ME, AND SENT THE CORN TO GALILEE. When I had 
  done this, I offered Ebutius battle; but when he would not accept of the offer, 
  for he was terrified at our readiness and courage, I altered my route, AND MARCHED 
  TOWARDS NEOPOLITANUS, because I had heard that the country about Tiberias was 
  laid waste by him. THIS NEOPOLITANUS WAS CAPTAIN OF A TROOP OF HORSE, AND HAD 
  THE CUSTODY OF SCYTHOPLIS INTRUSTED TO HIS CARE BY THE ENEMY; and when I had 
  hindered him from doing any further mischief to Tiberias, I set myself to make 
  provision for the affairs of Galilee. </p>
<p>25. But when John, the son of Levi, who, as we before told you, abode at Gischala, 
  was informed how all things had succeeded to my mind, and that I was much in 
  favor with those that were under me, as also that the enemy were greatly afraid 
  of me, he was not pleased with it, as thinking my prosperity tended to his ruin. 
  So he took up a bitter envy and enmity against me; and hoping, that if he could 
  inflame those that were under me to hate me,. he should put an end to the prosperity 
  I was in, he tried to persuade the inhabitants of Tiberias and of Sepphoris, 
  (and for those of Gabara he supposed they would be also of the same mind with 
  the others,) WHICH WERE THE GREATEST CITIES OF GALILEE, to revolt from their 
  subjection to me, and to be of his party; and told them that he would command 
  them better than I did. As for the people of Sepphoris, who belonged to neither 
  of us, because they had chosen to be in subjection to the Romans, they did not 
  comply with his proposal; and for those of Tiberias, they did not indeed so 
  far comply as to make a revolt from under me, but they agreed to be his friends, 
  while the inhabitants of Gabara did go over to John; and it was Simon that persuaded 
  them so to do, one who was both the principal man in the city, and a particular 
  friend and companion of John. It is true, these did not openly own the making 
  a revolt, because they were in great fear of the Galileans, and had frequent 
  experience of the good-will they bore to me; yet did they privately watch for 
  a proper opportunity TO LAY SNARES FOR ME; AND INDEED I THEREBY CAME INTO THE 
  GREATEST DANGER, on the occasion following. </p>
<p>26. There were some bold young men of the village of Dabaritta, who observed 
  that the wife of Ptolemy, the king's procurator, was to make a progress over 
  the great plain with a mighty attendance, and with some horsemen that followed 
  as a guard to them, and this out of a country that was subject to the king and 
  queen, into the jurisdiction of the Romans; and fell upon them on a sudden, 
  and obliged the wife of Ptolemy to fly away, and plundered all the carriages. 
  They also came to me to Tarichese, with four mules' loading of garments, and 
  other furniture; and the weight of the silver they brought was not small, and 
  there were five hundred pieces of gold also. Now I had a mind to preserve these 
  spoils for Ptolemy, who was my countryman; and it is prohibited (12) by our 
  laws even to spoil our enemies; so I said to those that brought these spoils, 
  that they ought to be kept, in order to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem with 
  them when they came to be sold. But the young men took it very ill that they 
  did not receive a part of those spoils for themselves, as they expected to have 
  done; so they went among the villages in the neighborhood of Tiberias, AND TOLD 
  THE PEOPLE THAT I WAS GOING TO BETRAY THEIR COUNTRY TO THE ROMANS, and that 
  I used deceitful language to them, when I said, that what had been thus gotten 
  by rapine should be kept FOR THE REBUILDING OF THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM; although 
  I had resolved to restore these spoils again to their former owner. And indeed 
  they were herein not mistaken as to my intentions; for when I had gotten clear 
  of them, I sent for two of the principal men, Dassion, and Janneus the son of 
  Levi, persons that were among the chief friends of the king, and commanded them 
  to take the furniture that had been plundered, and to send it to him; and I 
  threatened that I would order them to be put to death by way of punishment, 
  if they discovered this my command to any other person. </p>
<p>27. Now, when all Galilee was filled with this rumor, that their country was 
  about to be betrayed by me to the Romans, and when all men were exasperated 
  against me, and ready to bring me to punishment, the inhabitants of Tarichee 
  did also themselves suppose that what the young men said was true, and persuaded 
  my guards and armed men to leave me when I was asleep, and to come presently 
  to the hippodrome, in order there to take counsel against me their commander. 
  And when they had prevailed with them, and they were gotten together, they found 
  there a great company assembled already, who all joined in one clamor, to bring 
  the man who was so wicked to them as to betray them, to his due punishment; 
  and it was Jesus, the son of Sapphias, who principally set them on. He was ruler 
  in Tiberias, a wicked man, and naturally disposed to make disturbances in matters 
  of consequence; a seditious person he was indeed, and an innovator beyond every 
  body else. He then took the laws of Moses into his hands, and came into the 
  midst of the people, and said,&quot; O my fellow citizens! if you are not disposed 
  to hate Josephus on your own account, have regard, however, to these laws of 
  your country, which your commander-in-chief is going to betray; hate him therefore 
  on both these accounts, and bring the man who hath acted thus insolently, to 
  his deserved punishment.&quot; </p>
<p>28. When he had said this, and the multitude had openly applauded him for what 
  he had said, he took some of the armed men, and made haste away to the house 
  in which I lodged, as if he would kill me immediately, while I was wholly insensible 
  of all till this disturbance happened; and by reason of the pains I had been 
  taking, was fallen fast asleep. But Simon, who was intrusted with the care of 
  my body, and was the only person that stayed with me, and saw the violent incursion 
  the citizens made upon me, awaked me, and told me of the danger I was in, and 
  desired me to let him kill me, that I might die bravely and like a general, 
  before my enemies came in, and forced me [to kill myself], or killed me themselves. 
  Thus did he discourse to me; but I committed the care of my life to God, and 
  made haste to go out to the multitude. Accordingly, I put on a black garment, 
  and hung my sword at my neck, and went by such a different way to the hippodrome, 
  wherein I thought none of my adversaries would meet me; so I appeared among 
  them on the sudden, and fell down flat on the earth, and bedewed the ground 
  with my tears: then I seemed to them all an object of compassion. And when I 
  perceived the change that was made in the multitude, I TRIED TO DIVIDE THEIR 
  OPINIONS before the armed men should return from my house; so I granted them 
  that I had been as wicked as they supposed me to be; but still I entreated them 
  to let me first inform them for what use I had kept that money which arose from 
  the plunder, and, that they might then kill me if they pleased: and upon the 
  multitude's ordering me to speak, the armed men came upon me, and when they 
  saw me, they ran to kill me; but when the multitude bade them hold their hands, 
  they complied, and expected that as soon as I should own to them that I kept 
  the money for the king, it would be looked on as a confession of my treason, 
  and they should then be allowed to kill me. </p>
<p>29. WHEN, THEREFORE, SILENCE WAS MADE BY THE WHOLE MULTITUDE, I spake thus 
  to them: &quot;O MY COUNTRYMEN! I refuse not to die, if justice so require. 
  However, I am desirous to tell you the truth of this matter before I die; for 
  as I know that this city of yours [Tarichee] was a city of great hospitality, 
  and filled with abundance of such men as have left their own countries, and 
  are come hither to be partakers of your fortune, whatever it be, I HAD A MIND 
  TO BUILD WALLS ABOUT IT, out of this money, for which you are so angry with 
  me, while yet it was to be expended in building your own walls.&quot; Upon my 
  saying this, the people of Taricheae <b>(Jerusalem)?</b> and the strangers cried 
  out, that&quot; they gave me thanks, and desired me to be of good courage,&quot; 
  although the Galileans and the people of Tiberias continued in their wrath against 
  me, insomuch that there arose a tumult among them, while some threatened to 
  kill me, and some bade me not to regard them; but when I promised them that 
  I would build them walls at Tiberias, and at other cities that wanted them, 
  they gave credit to what I promised, and returned every one to his own home. 
  So I escaped the forementioned danger, beyond all my hopes, and returned to 
  my own house, accompanied with my friends, and TWENTY ARMED MEN also. </p>
<p>30. However, these robbers and other authors of this tumult, who were afraid, 
  on their own account, lest I should punish them for what they had done, took 
  SIX HUNDRED ARMED MEN <b>(30 TO 1)</b>, and came to the house where I abode, 
  in order to set it on fire. When this their insult was told me, I thought it 
  indecent for me to run away, and I resolved to expose myself to danger, and 
  to act with some boldness; so I gave order to shut the doors, and went up into 
  an upper room, and desired that they would send in some of their men to receive 
  the money [from the spoils] for I told them they would then have no occasion 
  to be angry with me; and when they had sent in one of the boldest of them all, 
  I had him whipped severely, and I commanded that ONE OF HIS HANDS SHOULD BE 
  CUT OFF, and hung about his neck; and in this case was he put out to those that 
  sent him. At which procedure of mine they were greatly affrighted, and in no 
  small consternation, and were afraid that they should themselves be served in 
  like manner, if they staid there; for they supposed that I had in the house 
  more armed men than they had themselves; so they ran away immediately, while 
  I, by the use of this stratagem, escaped this their second treacherous design 
  against me. </p>
<p>31. But there were still some that irritated the multitude against me, and 
  said that those great men that belonged to the king ought not to be suffered 
  to live, if they would not change their religion to the religion of those to 
  whom they fled for safety: they spake reproachfully of them also, and said that 
  they were wizards, and such as called in the Romans upon them. So the multitude 
  was soon deluded by such plausible pretenses as were agreeable to their own 
  inclinations, and were prevailed on by them. But when I was informed of this, 
  I instructed the multitude again, that those who fled to them for refuge ought 
  not to be persecuted: I also laughed at the allegation about witchcraft, (13) 
  and told them that the Romans would not maintain so many ten thousand soldiers, 
  if they could overcome their enemies by wizards. Upon my saying this, the people 
  assented for a while; but they returned again afterwards, as irritated by some 
  ill people against the great men; nay, they once made an assault upon the house 
  in which they dwelt at Tarichess, in order to kill them; which, when I was informed 
  of, I was afraid lest so horrid a crime should take effect, and NOBODY ELSE 
  WOULD MAKE THAT CITY THEIR REFUGE ANYMORE. I therefore came myself, and some 
  others with me, to the house where these great men lived, and locked the doors, 
  and had a trench drawn from their house leading to the lake, and sent for a 
  ship, and embarked therein with them, AND SAILED TO THE CONFINES OF HIPPOS: 
  I also paid them the value of their horses; nor in such a flight could I have 
  their horses brought to them. I then dismissed them, and begged of them earnestly 
  that they would courageously bear this distress which befell them. I was also 
  myself greatly displeased that I was compelled to expose those that had fled 
  to me to go again into an enemy's country; yet did I think it more eligible 
  that they should perish among the Romans, if it should so happen, than in the 
  country that was under my jurisdiction. However, they escaped at length, and 
  king Agrippa forgave them their offenses. And this was the conclusion of what 
  concerned these men. </p>
<p>32. But as for the inhabitants of the city of Tiberias, they wrote to the king, 
  and desired him to send them forces sufficient to be a guard to their country; 
  for that they were desirous to come over to him: this was what they wrote to 
  him. But when I came to them, they desired me to build their walls, as I had 
  promised them to do; for they had heard that the walls of Tarichess were already 
  built. I agreed to their proposal accordingly; and when I had made preparation 
  for the entire building, I GAVE ORDERS TO THE ARCHITECTS TO GO TO WORK <b>(compare 
  1 Corinthians 3:10-17)</b>, BUT ON THE THIRD DAY, WHEN I WAS GONE TO TARICHESS 
  WHICH WAS THIRTY FURLONGS DISTANT FROM TIBERIUS...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg138a.gif" width="527" height="237"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Sepphoris (the Inside world), Tiberius (the Outer world)</b></p>
<p align="left">...it so fell out, that some Roman horsemen were discovered on 
  their march, not far from the city, which made it to be supposed that the forces 
  were come from the king; upon which they shouted, and lifted up their voices 
  in commendations of the king, and in reproaches against me. Hereupon one came 
  running to me, and told me what their dispositions were, and that they had resolved 
  to revolt from me: upon hearing which news I was very much alarmed; for I had 
  already sent away my armed men from Tarichess, to their own homes, because the 
  next day was our sabbath; for I would not have the people of Tarichess disturbed 
  [on that day] by a multitude of soldiers; and indeed, whenever I sojourned at 
  that city, I never took any particular care for a guard about my own body, because 
  I had had frequent instances of the fidelity its inhabitants bore to me. I had 
  now about me NO MORE THAN SEVEN ARMED MEN, besides some friends, and was doubtful 
  what to do; for to send to recall my own forces I did not think proper, because 
  the present day was almost over; and had those forces been with me, I could 
  not take up arms on the next day, because our laws forbade us so to do, even 
  though our necessity should be very great; and if I should permit the people 
  of Tarichess, and the strangers with them, to guard the city, I saw that they 
  would not be sufficient for that purpose, and I perceived that I should be obliged 
  to delay my assistance a great while; for I thought with myself that the forces 
  that came from the king would prevent me, and that I should be driven out of 
  the city. I considered, therefore, how to get clear of these forces by a stratagem; 
  so I immediately placed those my friends of Tarichee, on whom I could best confide, 
  at the gates, to watch those very carefully who went out at those gates: I also 
  called to me the heads of families, and bade every one of them to seize upon 
  a ship (14) to go on board it, and to take a master with them, and follow him 
  to the city of Tiberias. I also myself went on board one of those ships, with 
  my friends, AND THE SEVEN ARMED MEN ALREADY MENTIONED, AND SAILED FOR TIBERIUS. 
</p>
<p>33. But now, when the people of Tiberias perceived that there were no forces 
  come from the king, and yet saw the whole lake full of ships, they were in fear 
  what would become of their city, and were greatly terrified, as supposing that 
  the ships were full of men on board; so they then changed their minds, and threw 
  down their weapons, and met me with their wives and children, and made acclamations 
  to me with great commendations; for they imagined that I did not know their 
  former inclinations [to have been against me]; so they persuaded me to spare 
  the city. But when I was come near enough, I gave order to the masters of the 
  ships to cast anchor a good way off the land, that the people of Tiberias might 
  not perceive that the ships had no men on board; but I went nearer to the people 
  in one of the ships, and rebuked them for their folly, ,and that they were so 
  fickle as, without any just occasion in the world, to revolt from their fidelity 
  to me. However, assured them that I would entirely forgive them for the time 
  to come, if they would send TEN of the ringleaders of the multitude to me; and 
  when they complied readily with this proposal, and sent me the men forementioned, 
  I put them on board a ship, and sent them away to Tarichese; AND ORDERED THEM 
  TO BE KEPT IN PRISON <b>(compare the chapters of the Book of Enoch)</b>.. </p>
<p>34. And by this stratagem it was that I gradually got all the senate of Tiberias 
  into my power, and sent them to the city forementioned, with many of the principal 
  men among the populace, and those not fewer in number than the other. But when 
  the multitude saw into what great miseries they had brought themselves, they 
  desired me to punish the author of this sedition: his name was Clitus, a young 
  man, bold and rash in his undertakings. Now, since I thought it not agreeable 
  to piety to put one of my own people to death, and yet found it necessary to 
  punish him, I ordered Levi, one of my own guards, to go to him, and cut off 
  one of Clitus's hands; but as he that was ordered to do this, was afraid to 
  go out of the ship alone, among 'so great a multitude, I was not willing that 
  the timorousness of the soldier should appear to the people of Tiberias. So 
  I called to Clitus himself and said to him,&quot; Since thou deservest to lose 
  both thine hands for thy ingratitude to me, be thou thine own executioner, lest, 
  if thou refusest so to be, thou undergo a worse punishment.&quot; And when he 
  earnestly begged of me to spare him one of his hands, it was with difficulty 
  that I granted it. So, in order to prevent the loss of both his hands, he willingly 
  took his sword, AND CUT OFF HIS OWN LEFT HAND; and this put an end to the sedition. 
</p>
<p>35. Now the men of Tiberias, after I was gone to Taricheae, perceived what 
  stratagem I had used against them, and they admired how I had put an end to 
  their foolish sedition, without shedding of blood. But now, when I had sent 
  for some of those multitudes of the people of Tiberias out of prison, among 
  whom were Justus and his father Pistus, I made them to sup with me; and during 
  our supper time I said to them, that I knew the power of the Romans was superior 
  to all others, but did not say so [publicly] because of the robbers. So I advised 
  them to do as I did, and to wait for a proper opportunity, and not to be uneasy 
  at my being their commander; for that they could not expect to have another 
  who would use the like moderation that I had done. I also put Justus in mind 
  how the Galileans had cut off his brother's hands before ever I came to Jerusalem, 
  upon an accusation laid against him, as if he had been a rogue, and had forged 
  some letters; as also how the people of Gamala, in a sedition they raised against 
  the Babylonians, after the departure of Philip, slew Chares, who was a kinsman 
  of Philip, and withal how they had wisely punished Jesus, his brother Justuses 
  sister's husband [with death]. When I had said this to them during supper time, 
  I in the morning ordered Justus, AND ALL THAT WERE IN PRISON, TO BE LOOSED OUT 
  OF IT, and sent away. </p>
<p>36. But before this, it happened that Philip, the son of Jacimus, went out 
  of the citadel of Gamala upon the following occasion: When Philip had been informed 
  that Varus was put out of his government by king Agrippa, and that Equieulus 
  Modius, a man that was of old his friend and companion, was come to succeed 
  him, he wrote to him, and related what turns of fortune he had had, and desired 
  him to forward the letters he sent to the king and queen. Now, when Modius had 
  received these letters, he was exceedingly glad, and sent the letters to the 
  king and queen, who were then about Berytus. But when king Agrippa knew that 
  the story about Philip was false, (for it had been given out, that the Jews 
  had begun a war with the Romans, and that this Philip had been their commander 
  in that war,) he sent some horsemen to conduct Philip to him; and when he was 
  come, he saluted him very obligingly, and showed him to the Roman commanders, 
  and told them that this was the man of whom the report had gone about as if 
  he had revolted from the Romans. He also bid him to take some horsemen with 
  him, and to go quickly to the citadel of Gamala, and to bring out thence all 
  his domestics, and to restore the Babylonians to Batanea again. He also gave 
  it him in charge to take all possible care that none of his subjects should 
  be guilty of making any innovation. Accordingly, upon these directions from 
  the king, he made haste to do what he was commanded. </p>
<p>37. Now there was one Joseph, the son of a female physician, who excited a 
  great many young men to join with him. He also insolently addressed himself 
  to the principal persons at Gamala, and persuaded them to revolt from the king; 
  and take up arms, and gave them hopes that they should, by his means, recover 
  their liberty. And some they forced into the service, and those that would not 
  acquiesce in what they had resolved on, they slew. They also slew Chares, and 
  with him Jesus, one of his kinsmen, and a brother of Justus of Tiberias, as 
  we have already said. Those of Gamala also wrote to me, desiring me to send 
  them an armed force, and workmen to raise up the walls of their city; nor did 
  I reject either of their requests. The region of Gaulanitis did also revolt 
  from the king, AS FAR AS THE VILLAGE SOLYMA. I also built a wall about Seleucia 
  and Soganni, which are villages naturally of very great strength. Moreover, 
  I, in like manner, WALLED SEVERAL VILLAGES OF UPPER GALILEE, though they were 
  very rocky of themselves. Their names are Jamnia, and Meroth, and Achabare. 
  I also fortified, in THE LOWER GALILEE <b>(as above, so below)</b>, the cities 
  Tarichee, Tiberias, Sepphoris, and the villages, the cave of Arbela, Bersobe, 
  Selamin, Jotapata, Capharecho, and Sigo, and Japha, and Mount Tabor. (15) I 
  also laid up a great quantity of corn in these places, and arms withal, THAT 
  MIGHT BE FOR THEIR SECURITY AFTERWARD. </p>
<p>38. But the hatred that John, the son of Levi, bore to me, grew now more violent, 
  while he could not bear my prosperity with patience. So he proposed to himself, 
  by all means possible, to make away with me; and built the walls of Gischala, 
  which was the place of his nativity. He then sent his brother Simon, and Jonathan, 
  the son of Sisenna, and about a hundred armed men, to Jerusalem, to Simon, the 
  son of Gamaliel, (16) in order to persuade him to induce the commonalty of Jerusalem 
  to take from me the government over the Galileans, and to give their suffrages 
  for conferring that authority upon him. This Simon was of the city of Jerusalem, 
  and of a very noble family of the sect of the Pharisees, which are supposed 
  to excel others in the accurate knowledge of the laws of their country. He was 
  a man of great wisdom and reason, and capable of restoring public affairs by 
  his prudence, when they were in an ill posture. He was also an old friend and 
  companion of John; but at that time he had a difference with me. When therefore 
  he had received such an exhortation, he persuaded the high priests, Ananus, 
  and Jesus the son of Gamala, and some others of the same seditious faction, 
  to cut me down, NOW I WAS GROWING SO GREAT, AND NOT TO OVERLOOK ME WHILE I WAS 
  AGGRANDIZING MYSELF TO THE HEIGHT OF GLORY <b>(compare 2 Corinthians 12:1-8)</b>; 
  and he said that it would be for the advantage of the Galileans, if I were deprived 
  of my government there. Ananus also, and his friends, desired them to make no 
  delay about the matter, lest I should get the knowledge of what was doing too 
  soon, and should come and make an assault upon the city with a great army. This 
  was the counsel of Simon; but Artanus the high priest demonstrated to them that 
  this was not an easy thing to be done, because many of the high priests and 
  of the rulers of the people bore witness that I had acted like an excellent 
  general, and that it was the work of ill men to accuse one against whom they 
  had nothing to say. </p>
<p>39. When Simon heard Ananus say this, he desired that the messengers would 
  conceal the thing, and not let it come among many; for that he would take care 
  to have Josephus removed out of Galilee very quickly. So he called for John's 
  brother, [Simon,] and charged him that they should send presents to Ananus and 
  his friends; for, as he said, they might probably by that means persuade them 
  to change their minds. And indeed Simon did at length thus compass what he aimed 
  at; for Artanus, and those with him, being corrupted by bribes, agreed to expel 
  me out of Galilee, without making the rest of the citizens acquainted with what 
  they were doing. Accordingly, they resolved to send men of distinction as to 
  their families, and of distinction as to their learning also. Two of these were 
  of the populace, Jonathan (17) and Ananias, by sect Pharisees; while the third, 
  Jozar, was of the stock of the priests, and a Pharisee also; and Simon, the 
  last of them, was of the youngest of the high priests. These had it given them 
  in charge, that, when they were come to the multitude of the Galileans, they 
  should ask them, what was the reason of their love to me? and if they said that 
  it was because I was born at Jerusalem, that they should reply, that they four 
  were all born at the same place; and if they should say, it was because I was 
  well versed in their law, they should reply, that neither were they unacquainted 
  with the practices of their country; but if, besides these, they should say, 
  they loved me because I was a priest, they should reply, that two of these were 
  priests also. </p>
<p>40. Now, when they had given Jonathan and his companions these instructions, 
  they gave them forty thousand [drachmae] out of the public money: but when they 
  heard that there was a certain Galilean that then sojourned at Jerusalem, whose 
  name was Jesus, who had about him a band of six hundred armed men, they sent 
  for him, and gave him three months pay, and gave him orders to follow Jonathan 
  and his companions, and be obedient to them. They also gave money to three hundred 
  men that were citizens of Jerusalem, to maintain them all, and ordered them 
  also to follow the ambassadors; and when they had complied, and were gotten 
  ready for the march, Jonathan and his companions went out with them, having 
  along with them John's brother and a hundred armed men. The charge that was 
  given them by those that sent them was this: That if I would voluntarily lay 
  down my arms, THEY SHOULD SEND ME ALIVE TO THE CITY OF JERUSALEM; but that, 
  in case I opposed them, they should kill me, and fear nothing; for that it was 
  their command for them so to do. They also wrote to John to make all ready for 
  fighting me, and gave orders to the inhabitants of Sepphoris, and Gabara, and 
  Tiberins, to send auxiliaries to John. </p>
<p>41. Now, as my father wrote me an account of this, (for Jesus the son of Gamala, 
  who was present in that council, a friend and companion of mine, told him of 
  it,) I was very much troubled, as discovering thereby that my fellow citizens 
  proved so ungrateful to me, as, out of envy, to give order that I should be 
  slain: my father earnestly pressed me also in his letter to come to him, for 
  that he longed to see his son before he died. I informed my friends of these 
  things, and that IN THREE DAYS TIME I SHOULD LEAVE THE COUNTRY, AND GO HOME. 
  Upon hearing this, they were all very sorry, and desired me, with tears in their 
  eyes, not to leave them to be destroyed; for so they thought they should be, 
  if I were deprived of the command over them: but as I did not grant their request, 
  but was taking care of my own safety, the Galileans, out of their dread of the 
  consequence of my departure, that they should then be at the mercy of the robbers, 
  sent messengers over all Galilee to inform them of my resolution to leave them. 
  Whereupon, as soon as they heard it, they got together in great numbers, from 
  all parts, with their wives and children; and this they did, as it appeared 
  to me, not more out of their affection to me, than out of their fear on their 
  own account; for while I staid with them, they supposed that they should suffer 
  no harm. So they all came into the great plain, wherein I lived, the name of 
  which was ASOCHIS. </p>
<p>42. BUT WONDERFUL IT WAS WHAT A DREAM I SAW THAT NIGHT; for when I had betaken 
  myself to my bed, as grieved and disturbed at the news that had been written 
  to me, it seemed to me, that a certain person stood by me, (18) and said, &quot;O 
  Josephus! LEAVE OFF TO AFFLICT THY SOUL, AND PUT AWAY ALL FEAR, FOR WHAT NOW 
  GRIEVES THEE WILL RENDER THEE VERY CONSIDERABLE, AND IN ALL RESPECTS MOST HAPPY; 
  FOR THOU SHALT GET OVER NOT ONLY THESE DIFFICULTIES, BUT MANY OTHERS WITH GREAT 
  SUCCESS <b>(compare Acts 26:13-21)</b>. However, be not cast down, but remember 
  that thou art to fight with the Romans.&quot; When I had seen this dream, I 
  got up with an intention of going down to the plain. Now, when THE WHOLE MULTITUDE 
  OF THE GALILEANS, among whom were the women and children, saw me, they threw 
  themselves down upon their faces, and, with tears in their eyes, besought me 
  not to leave them exposed to their enemies, nor to go away and permit their 
  country to be injured by them. But when I did not comply, with their entreaties, 
  they compelled me to take an oath, that I would stay with them: they also cast 
  abundance of reproaches upon the people of Jerusalem, that they would not let 
  their country enjoy peace. </p>
<p>43. When I heard this, and saw what sorrow the people were in, I was moved 
  with compassion to them, and thought it became me to undergo the most manifest 
  hazards for the sake of so great a multitude; so I let them know I would stay 
  with them. And when I had given order THAT FIVE THOUSAND SHOULD COME TO ME ARMED, 
  and with provisions for their maintenance, I sent the rest away to their own 
  homes; and when those five thousand were come, I took them, together with three 
  thousand of the soldiers that were with me before, and eighty horsemen, and 
  marched to thevillage of Chabolo, situated in the confines of Ptolimias, and 
  there kept my forces together, pretending to get ready to fight with Placidus, 
  who was come with two cohorts of footmen, and one troop of horsemen, and was 
  sent thither by Cestius Gallus to burn those villages of Galilee that were near 
  Ptolemais. Upon whose casting up a bank before the city Ptolemais, I also pitched 
  my camp at about the distance of sixty furlongs from that village. And now we 
  frequently brought out our forces as if we would fight, but proceeded no further 
  than skirmishes at a distance; for when Placidus perceived that I was earnest 
  to come to a battle, he was afraid, and avoided it. Yet did he not remove from 
  the neighborhood of Ptolemais. </p>
<p>44. About this time it was that Jonathan and his fellow legates came. They 
  were sent, as we have said already, by Simon, and Ananus the high priest. And 
  Jonathan contrived how he might catch me by treachery; for he durst not make 
  any attempt upon me openly. So he wrote me the following epistle: &quot;Jonathan 
  and those that are with him, and are sent by the people of Jerusalem, to Josephus, 
  send greeting. We are sent by the principal men of Jerusalem, who have heard 
  that John of Gischala hath laid many snares for thee, to rebuke him, and to 
  exhort him to be subject to thee hereafter. We are also desirous to consult 
  with thee about our common concerns, and what is fit to be done. We therefore 
  desire thee to come to us quickly, and to bring only a few men with thee; for 
  this village will not contain a great number of soldiers.&quot; Thus it was 
  that they wrote, as expecting one of these two things; either that I should 
  come without armed men, and then they should have me wholly in their power; 
  or, if I came with a great number, they should judge me to be a public enemy. 
  Now it was a horseman who brought the letter, a man at other times bold, and 
  one that had served in the army under the king. It was the second hour of the 
  night that he came, when I was feasting with my friends, and the principal of 
  the Galileans. This man, upon my servant's telling me that a certain horseman 
  of the Jewish nation was come, was called in at my command, but did not so much 
  as salute me at all, but held out a letter, and said, &quot;This letter is sent 
  thee by those that are come from Jerusalem; do thou write an answer to it quickly; 
  for I am obliged to return to them very soon. Now my guests could not but wonder 
  at the boldness of the soldier. But I desired him to sit down and sup with us; 
  but when he refused so to do, I held the letter in my hands as I received it, 
  and fell a talking with my guests about other matters. But a few hours afterwards, 
  I got up, and when I had dismissed the rest to go to their beds, I bid only 
  four of my intimate friends to stay, and ordered my servant to get some wine 
  ready. I also opened the letter so, that nobody could perceive it; and understanding 
  thereby presently the purport&middot; of the writing, I sealed it up again, 
  and appeared as if I had not yet read it, but only held it in my hands. I ordered 
  twenty drachmae should be given the soldier for the charges of his journey; 
  and when he took the money, and said that he thanked me for it, I perceived 
  that he loved money, and that he was to be caught chiefly by that means; and 
  I said to him,&quot; If thou wilt but drink with us, thou shalt have a drachma 
  for every glass thou drinkest.&quot; So he gladly embraced this proposal, and 
  drank a great deal of wine, in order to get the more money, and was so drunk, 
  that at last he could not keep the secrets he was intrusted with, but discovered 
  them without my putting questions to him, viz. That a treacherous design was 
  contrived against me, and that I was doomed to die by those that sent him. When 
  I heard this, I wrote back this answer: &quot;Josephus to Jonathan, and those 
  that are with him, sendeth greeting. Upon the information that you are come 
  in health into Galilee, I rejoice, and this especially because I can now resign 
  the care of public affairs here into your hands, AND RETURN INTO MY NATIVE COUNTRY, 
  WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE DESIRED TO DO A GREAT WHILE; and I confess I ought not 
  only to come to you as far as Xaloth, but farther, and this without your commands. 
  But I desire you to excuse me, because I cannot do it now, SINCE I WATCH THE 
  MOTIONS OF PLACIDUS, who hath a mind to go up into Galilee; and this I do here 
  at Chabolo. Do you therefore, on the receipt of this epistle, come hither to 
  me. Fare you well.&quot; </p>
<p>45. When I had written thus, and given the letter to be carried by the soldier, 
  I sent along with him thirty of the Galileans of the best characters, and gave 
  them instructions to salute those ambassadors, but to say nothing else to them. 
  I also gave orders to as many of those armed men, whom I esteemed most faithful 
  to me, to go along with the others, every one with him whom he was to guard, 
  lest some conversation might pass between those whom I sent and those who were 
  with Jonathan. So those men went [to Jonathan]. But when Jonathan and his partners 
  had failed in this their first attempt, they sent me another letter, the contents 
  whereof were as follows: &quot;Jonathan, and those with him, to Josephus, send 
  greeting. We require thee to come to us to the village Gabaroth, ON THE THIRD 
  DAY, without any armed men, that we may hear what thou hast to lay to the charge 
  of John [of Gischala].&quot; When they had written this letter, they saluted 
  the Galileans whom I sent, and came to Japha, which was the largest village 
  of all Galilee, and encompassed with very strong walls, and had a great number 
  of inhabitants in it. There the multitude of men, with their wives and children, 
  met them, and exclaimed loudly against them; and desired them to be gone, and 
  not to envy them the advantage of an excellent commander. With these clamors 
  Jonathan and his partners were greatly provoked, although they durst not show 
  their anger openly; so they made them no answer, but went to other villages. 
  But still the same clamors met them from all the people, who said, &quot;Nobody 
  should persuade them to have any other commander besides Josephus.&quot; So 
  Jonathan and his partners went away from them without success, and came TO SEPPHORIS, 
  THE GREATEST CITY OF ALL GALILEE. Now the men of that city, who inclined to 
  the Romans in their sentiments, met them indeed, but neither praised nor reproached 
  me and when they were gone down from Sepphoris to Asochis, the people of that 
  place made a clamor against them, as those of Japha had done; whereupon they 
  were able to contain themselves no longer, but ordered the armed men that were 
  with them to beat those that made the clamor with their clubs. And when they 
  came to Gabara, John met them with three thousand armed men; but, as I understood 
  by their letter that they had resolved to fight against me, I arose from Chabolo, 
  with three thousand armed men also; but left in my camp one of my fastest friends, 
  and came to Jotapata, as desirous to be near them, the distance being no more 
  than forty furlongs. Whence I wrote thus to them: &quot;If you are very desirous 
  that I should come to you, you know there are TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY CITIES IN 
  GALILEE <b>(Ten X 24)</b>; I will come to any of them which you please, excepting 
  Gaburn and Gischala; the one of which is John's native city, and the other in 
  confederacy and friendship with him.&quot; </p>
<p>46. When Jonathan and his partners had received this letter, they wrote me 
  no more answers, but called a council of their friends together; and taking 
  John into their consultation, they took counsel together by what means they 
  might attack me. John's opinion was, that they should write to all the cities 
  and villages that were in Galilee; for that there must be certainly one or two 
  persons in every one of them that were at variance with me, and that they should 
  be invited to come to oppose me as an enemy. He would also have them send this 
  resolution of theirs to the city of Jerusalem, that its citizens, upon the knowledge 
  of my being adjudged to be an enemy by the Galileans, might themselves I also 
  confirm that determination. He said also, that when this was done, even those 
  Galileans who were well affected to me, would desert me out of fear. When John 
  had given them this counsel, what he had said was very agreeable to the rest 
  of them. I was also made acquainted with these affairs about the third hour 
  of the night, by the means of one Saccheus, who had belonged to them, but now 
  deserted them and came over to me, and told me what they were about; so I perceived 
  that no time was to be lost. Accordingly, I gave command to Jacob, an armed 
  man of my guard, whom I esteemed faithful to me, to take two hundred men, and 
  to guard the passages that led from Gahara to Galilee, and to seize upon the 
  passengers, and send them to me, especially such as were caught with letters 
  about them: I also sent Jeremias himself, one of my friends, with six hundred 
  armed men, to the borders of Galilee, in order TO WATCH THE ROADS THAT LED FROM 
  THIS COUNTRY TO THE CITY JERUSALEM, and gave him charge to lay hold of such 
  as traveled with letters about them, to keep the men in bonds upon the place, 
  but to send me the letters. </p>
<p>47. When I had laid these commands upon them, I gave them orders, and bid them 
  take their arms AND BRING THREE DAYS PROVISIONS WITH THEM, AND BE WITH ME THE 
  NEXT DAY.. I also parted those that were about me INTO FOUR PARTS, and ordained 
  those of them that were most faithful to me to be a guard TO MY BODY. I also 
  set over them centurions, and commanded them TO TAKE CARE THAT NOT A SOLDIER 
  WHICH THEY DID NOT KNOW SHOULD MINGLE AMONG THEM <b>(compare 2 Timothy 2:1-5)</b>. 
  Now, on the fifth day following, when I was at Gabaroth, I found the entire 
  plain that was before the village full of armed men, who were come out of Galilee 
  to assist me: many others of the multitude, also, out of the village, ran along 
  with me. But as soon as I had taken my place, and began to speak to them, they 
  all made an acclamation, AND CALLED ME THE BENEFACTOR AND SAVIOR OF THE COUNTRY. 
  And when I had made them my acknowledgments, and thanked them [for their affection 
  to me], I ALSO ADVISED THEM TO FIGHT WITH NOBODY, (19) NOR TO SPOIL THE COUNTRY, 
  BUT TO PITCH THEIR TENTS IN THE PLAIN, AND BE CONTENT WITH THEIR SUSTENANCE 
  THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM; for I told them that I had a mind to compose these 
  troubles without shedding any blood. Now it came to pass, that on the very same 
  day those who were sent by John with letters, fell among the guards whom I had 
  appointed to watch the roads; so the men were themselves kept upon the place, 
  as my orders were, but I got the letters, which were full of reproaches and 
  lies; and I intended to fall upon these men, WITHOUT SAYING A WORD OF THESE 
  MATTERS TO ANY BODY. </p>
<p>48. Now, as soon as Jonathan and his companions heard of my coming, they took 
  all their own friends, and John with them, and retired to the house of Jesus, 
  WHICH WAS INDEED A LARGE CASTLE, AND NO WAY UNLIKE A CITADEL; so they privately 
  laid a band of armed men therein, and shut all the other doors but one, which 
  they kept open, and they expected that I should come out of the road to them, 
  to salute them. And indeed they had given orders to the armed men, that when 
  I came they should let nobody besides me come in, but should exclude others; 
  as supposing that, by this means, they should easily get me under their power: 
  but they were deceived in their expectation; for I perceived what snares they 
  had laid for me. Now, as soon as I was got off my journey, I took up my lodgings 
  over against them, and pretended to be asleep; so Jonathan and his party, thinking 
  that I was really asleep and at rest, made haste to go down into the plain, 
  to persuade the people that I was an ill governor. But the matter proved otherwise; 
  for, upon their appearance, there was a cry made by the Galileans immediately, 
  declaring their good opinion of me as their governor; and they made a clamor 
  against Jonathan and his partners for coming to them when they had suffered 
  no harm, and as though they would overturn their happy settlement; and desired 
  them by all means to go back again, for that they would never be persuaded to 
  have any other to rule over them but myself. When I heard of this, I did not 
  fear to go down into the midst of them; I went, therefore, myself down presently 
  to hear what Jonathan and his companions said. AS SOON AS I APPEARED, THERE 
  WAS IMMEDIATELY AN ACCLAMATION MADE TO ME BY THE WHOLE MULTITUDE, and a cry 
  in my commendation by them, who confessed their thanks was owing to me for my 
  good government of them. </p>
<p>49. When Jonathan and his companions heard this, they were in fear of their 
  own lives, and in danger lest they should be assaulted by the Galileans on nay 
  account; so they contrived how they might run away. But as they were not able 
  to get off, for I desired them to stay, they looked down with concern at my 
  words to them. I ordered, therefore, the multitude to restrain entirely their 
  acclamations, and placed the most faithful of my armed men upon the avenues, 
  to be a guard to us, lest John should unexpected fall upon us; and I encouraged 
  the Galileans to take their weapons, lest they should be disturbed at their 
  enemies, if any sudden insult should be made upon them. And then, in the first 
  place, I put Jonathan and his partners in mind of their [former] letter, and 
  after what manner they had written to me, and declared they were sent by the 
  common consent to the people of Jerusalem, to make up the differences I had 
  with John, and how they had desired me to come to them; and as I spake thus, 
  I publicly showed that letter they had written, till they could not at all deny 
  what they had done, the letter itself convicting them. I then said, &quot;O 
  Jonathan! and you that are sent with him as his colleagues, if I were to be 
  judged as to my behavior, compared with that of John's, and had brought no more 
  than TWO OR THREE WITNESSES, (20) good men and true, it is plain you had been 
  forced, upon the examination of their characters beforehand, to discharge the 
  accusations: that therefore you may be informed that I have acted well in the 
  affairs of Galilee, I think three witnesses too few to be brought by a man that 
  hath done as he ought to do; so I gave you all these for witnesses. Inquire 
  of them (21) how I have lived, and whether I have not behaved myself with all 
  decency, and after a virtuous manner, among them. And I further conjure you, 
  O Galileans! to hide no part of the truth, but to speak before these men as 
  before judges, whether I have in any thing acted otherwise than well.&quot; 
</p>
<p>50. WHILE I WAS THUS SPEAKING, THE UNITED VOICES OF ALL THE PEOPLE JOINED TOGETHER, 
  AND CALLED ME THEIR BENEFACTOR AND SAVIOR, and attested to my former behavior, 
  and exhorted me to continue so to do hereafter; and they all said, upon their 
  oaths, that their wives had been preserved free from injuries, and that no one 
  had ever been aggrieved by me. After this, I read to the Galileans two of those 
  epistles which had been sent by Jonathan and his colleagues, and which those 
  whom I had appointed to guard the road had taken, and sent to me. These were 
  full of reproaches, and of lies, as if I had acted more like a tyrant than a 
  governor against them, with many other things besides therein contained, which 
  were no better indeed than impudent falsities. I also informed the multitude 
  how I came by these letters, and that those who carried them delivered them 
  up voluntarily; for I was not willing that my enemies should know any thing 
  of the guards I had set, lest they should be afraid, and leave off writing hereafter. 
</p>
<p>51. When the multitude heard these things, they were greatly provoked at Jonathan, 
  and his colleagues that were with him, and were going to attack them, and kill 
  them; and this they had certainly done, unless I had restrained the anger of 
  the Galileans, and said, that&quot; I forgave Jonathan and his colleagues what 
  was past, IF THEY WOULD REPENT, and go to their own country, and tell those 
  who sent them the truth, as to my conduct.&quot; When I had said this, I let 
  them go, although I knew they would do nothing of what they had promised. But 
  the multitude were very much enraged against them, and entreated me to give 
  them leave to punish them for their insolence; yet did I try all methods to 
  persuade them to spare the men; for I knew that every instance of sedition was 
  pernicious to the public welfare. But the multitude was too angry with them 
  to be dissuaded, and all of them went immediately to the house in which Jonathan 
  and his colleagues abode. However, when I perceived that their rage could not 
  be restrained, I got on horseback, and ordered the multitude to follow me to 
  the village Sogane, which was twenty furlongs off Gabara; and by using this 
  stratagem, I so managed myself, as not to appear to begin a civil war ,amongst 
  them. </p>
<p>52. But when I was come near Sogane, I caused the multitude to make a halt, 
  and exhorted them not to be so easily provoked to anger, and to the inflicting 
  such punishments as could not be afterwards recalled: I also gave order, that 
  a hundred men, who were already in years, and were principal men among them, 
  should get themselves ready to go to the city of Jerusalem, and should .make 
  a complaint before the people of such as raised seditions in the country. And 
  I said to them, that&quot; in case they be moved with what you say, you shall 
  desire the community to write to me, and to enjoin me to continue in Galilee, 
  and to order Jonathan and his colleagues to depart out of it.&quot; When I had 
  suggested these instructions to them, and while they were getting themselves 
  ready as fast as they could, I sent them on this errand the third day after 
  they had been assembled: I also sent five hundred armed men with them [as a 
  guard]. I then wrote TO MY FRIENDS IN SAMARIA, to take care that they might 
  safely pass through the country: FOR SAMARIA WAS ALREADY UNDER THE ROMANS, and 
  it was absolutely necessary for those that go quickly [to Jerusalem] to pass 
  through that country; FOR IN THAT ROAD YOU MAY, IN THREE DAY'S TIME, GO FROM 
  GALILEE TO JERUSALEM. I also went myself, and conducted the old men as far as 
  the bounds of Galilee, and set guards in the roads, that it might not be easily 
  known by any one that these men were gone. And when I had thus done, I went 
  and abode at Japha. </p>
<p>53. Now Jonathan and his colleagues, having failed of accomplishing what they 
  would have done against me, sent John back to Gischala, but went themselves 
  to the city of Tiberias, expecting it would submit itself to them; and this 
  was founded on a letter which Jesus, their then governor, had written them, 
  promising that, if they came, the multitude would receive them, and choose to 
  be under their government; so they went their ways with this expectation. But 
  Silas, who, as I said, had been left curator of Tiberias by me, informed me 
  of this, and desired me to make haste thither. Accordingly, I complied with 
  his advice immediately, and came thither; but found myself in danger of my life, 
  from the following occasion: Jonathan and his colleagues had been at Tiberias, 
  and had persuaded a great many of such as had a quarrel with me to desert me; 
  but when they heard of my coming, they were in fear for themselves, and came 
  to me; and when they had saluted me, they said, that I was a happy man IN HAVING 
  BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL IN THE GOVERNMENT OF GALILEE; AND THEY CONGRADULATED 
  ME UPON THE HONORS THAT WERE PAID ME: FOR THEY AID THAT MY GLORY WAS A CREDIT 
  UNTO THEM, since they had been my teachers and fellow citizens; and they said 
  further, that it was but just that they should prefer my friendship to them 
  rather than John's, and that they would have immediately gone home, but that 
  they staid that they might deliver up John into my power; and when they said 
  this they took their oaths of it, and those such as are most tremendous amongst 
  us, and such as I did not think fit to disbelieve. However, they desired me 
  to lodge some where else, because the next day was the sabbath, and that it 
  was not fit the city of Tiberias should be disturbed [on that day]. </p>
<p>54. So I suspected nothing, and went away to Tarichese; yet did I withal leave 
  some to make inquiry in the city how matters went, and whether any thing was 
  said about me: I also set many persons all the way that led from Tarichese to 
  Tiberias, that they might communicate from one to another, if they learned any 
  news from those that were left in the city. On the next day, therefore, they 
  all came into the Proseucha; (22) it was a large edifice, and capable of receiving 
  a great number of people; thither Jonathan went in, and though he durst not 
  openly speak of a revolt, yet did he say that their city stood in need of a 
  better governor than it then had. But Jesus, who was the ruler, made no scruple 
  to speak out, and said openly,&quot; O fellow citizens! it is better for you 
  to be in subjection to four than to one; and those such as are of high birth, 
  and not without reputation for their wisdom;&quot; and pointed to Jonathan and 
  his colleagues. Upon his saying this, Justus came in and commended him for what 
  he had said, and persuaded some of the people to be of his mind also. But the 
  multitude were not pleased with what was said, and had certainly gone into a 
  tumult, unless the sixth hour, which was now come, had dissolved the assembly, 
  at which hour our laws require us to go to dinner on sabbath days; so Jonathan 
  and his colleagues put off their council till the next day, and went off without 
  success. When I was informed of these affairs, I determined to go to the city 
  of Tiberias in the morning. Accordingly, on the next day, about the first hour 
  of the day, I came from Tarichee, and found the multitude already assembled 
  in the Proseucha; but on what account they were gotten together, those that 
  were assembled did not know. But when Jonathan and his colleagues saw me there 
  unexpectedly, they were in disorder; after which they raised a report of their 
  own contrivance, that Roman horsemen were seen at a place called Union, in the 
  borders of Galilee, THIRTY FURLONGS DISTANT FROM THE CITY. Upon which report, 
  Jonathan and his colleagues cunningly exhorted me not to neglect this matter, 
  nor to suffer the land to be spoiled by the enemy. And this they said with a 
  design to remove me out of the city, under the pretense of the want of extraordinary 
  assistance, while they might dispose the city to be my enemy. </p>
<p>55. As for myself, although I knew of their design, yet did I comply with what 
  they proposed, lest the people of Tiberias should have occasion to suppose that 
  I was not careful of their security. I therefore went out; but, when I was at 
  the place, I found not the least footsteps of any enemy, so I returned as fast 
  as ever I could, and found the whole council assembled, and the body of the 
  people gotten together, and Jonathan and his colleagues bringing vehement accusations 
  against me, as one who had no concern to ease them of the burdens of war, and 
  as one that lived luxuriously. And as they were discoursing thus, they produced 
  four letters, as written to them from some people that lived at the borders 
  of Galilee, imploring that they would come to their assistance, for that there 
  was an army of Romans, both horsemen and footmen, who would come and lay waste 
  the country on the third day; they desired them also to make haste, and not 
  to overlook them. When the people of Tiberias heard this, they thought they 
  spake truth, and made a clamor against me, and said I ought not to sit still, 
  but to go away to the assistance of their countrymen. Hereupon I said (for I 
  understood the meaning of Jonathan and his colleagues) that I was ready to comply 
  with what they proposed, and without delay to march to the war which they spake 
  of, yet did I advise them, at the same time, that since these letters declared 
  that the Romans would make their assault in four several places, THEY SHOULD 
  PART THEIR FORCES ITO FIVE BODIES <b>(army, navy, marines, air force and coast 
  guard)</b>, and make Jonathan and his colleagues generals of each body of them, 
  because it was fit for brave men, not only to give counsel, but to take the 
  place of leaders, and assist their countrymen when such a necessity pressed 
  them; for, said I, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO LEAD MORE THAN ONE PARTY. This 
  advice of mine greatly pleased the multitude; SO THEY COMPELLED THEM TO GO FORTH 
  TO WAR. But their designs were put into very much disorder, because they had 
  not done what they had designed to do, ON ACCOUNT OF MY STRATAGEM, WHICH WAS 
  OPPOSITE TO THEIR UNDERTAKINGS. </p>
<p>56. Now there was one whose name was Ananias (a wicked man he was, and very 
  mischievous); he proposed that a general religious fast (23) should be appointed 
  the next day for all the people, and gave order that at the same hour they should 
  come to the same place, without any weapons, to make it manifest before God, 
  that while they obtained his assistance, they thought all these weapons useless. 
  This he said, not out of piety, but that they might catch me and my friends 
  unarmed. Now, I was hereupon forced to comply, lest I should appear to despise 
  a proposal that tended to piety. As soon, therefore, as we were gone home, Jonathan 
  and his colleagues wrote to John to come to them in the morning, and desiring 
  him to come with as many soldiers as he possibly could, for that they should 
  then be able easily to get me into their hands, and to do all they desired to 
  do. When John had received this letter, he resolved to comply with it. As for 
  myself, on the next day, I ordered two of the guards of my body, whom I esteemed 
  the most courageous and most faithful, to hide daggers under their garments, 
  and to go along with me, that we might defend ourselves, if any attack should 
  be made upon us by our enemies. I also myself took MY BREASTPLATE, AND GIRDED 
  ON MY SWORD, so that it might be, as far as it was possible, concealed, and 
  came into the Proseucha. </p>
<p>57. Now Jesus, who was the ruler, commanded that they should exclude all that 
  came with me, for he kept the door himself, and suffered none but his friends 
  to go in. And while we were engaged in the duties of the day, and had betaken 
  ourselves to our prayers, Jesus got up, and inquired of me what was become of 
  the vessels that were taken out of the king's palace, when it was burnt down 
  [and] of that uncoined silver; and in whose possession they now were? This he 
  said, in order to drive away time till John should come. I said that Capellus, 
  and the ten principal men of Tiberias, had them all; and I told him that they 
  might ask them whether I told a lie or not. And when they said they had them, 
  he asked me, What is become of those twenty pieces of gold which thou didst 
  receive upon the sale of a certain weight of uncoined money? I replied, that 
  I had given them to those ambassadors of theirs, as a maintenance for them, 
  when they were sent by them to Jerusalem. So Jonathan and his colleagues said 
  that I had not done well to pay the ambassadors out of the public money. And 
  when the multitude were very angry at them for this, for they perceived the 
  wickednes of the men, I understood that a tumult was going to arise; and being 
  desirous to provoke the people to a greater rage against the men, I said, &quot;But 
  if I have not done well in paying our ambassadors out of the public stock, leave 
  off your anger at me, for I will repay the twenty pieces of gold myself.&quot; 
</p>
<p>58. When I had said this, Jonathan and his colleagues held their peace; but 
  the people were still more irritated against them, upon their openly showing 
  their unjust ill-will to me. When Jesus saw this change in file people, he ordered 
  them to depart, but desired the senate to stay; for that they could not examine 
  things of such a nature in a tumult: and as the people were crying out that 
  they would not leave me alone, there came one and told Jesus and his friends 
  privately, that John and his armed men were at hand: whereupon Jonathan and 
  his colleagues, being able to contain themselves no longer, (and perhaps the 
  providence of God hereby procuring my deliverance, for had not this been so, 
  I had certainly been destroyed by John,) said, &quot;O you people of Tiberias! 
  leave off this inquiry about the twenty pieces of gold; for Josephus hath not 
  deserved to die for them; but he hath deserved it by his desire of tyrannizing, 
  and by cheating the multitude of the Galileans with his speeches, in order to 
  gain the dominion over them.&quot; When he had said this, they presently laid 
  hands upon me, and endeavored to kill me: but as soon as those that were with 
  me saw what they did, they drew their swords, and threatened to smite them, 
  if they offered any violence to me. The people also took up stones, and were 
  about to throw them at Jonathan; and so they snatched me from the violence of 
  my enemies. </p>
<p>59. But as I was gone out a little way, I was just upon meeting John, who was 
  marching with his armed men. So I was afraid of him, and turned aside, and escaped 
  by a narrow passage to the lake, and seized on a ship, and embarked in it, and 
  sailed over to Tarichese. So, beyond my expectation, I escaped this danger. 
  Whereupon I presently sent for the chief of the Galileans, and told them after 
  what manner, against all faith given, I had been very near to destruction from 
  Jonathan and his colleagues, and the people of Tiberias. Upon which the multitude 
  of the Galileans were very. angry, and encouraged me to delay no longer to make 
  war upon them, but to permit them to go against John, and utterly to destroy 
  him, as well as Jonathan and his colleagues. However, I restrained them, though 
  they were in such a rage, and desired them to tarry a while, till we should 
  be informed what orders those ambassadors, that were sent by them to the city 
  of Jerusalem, should bring thence; for I told them that it was best for them 
  to act according to their determination; whereupon they were prevailed on. At 
  which time, also, John, when the snares he had laid did not take effect, returned 
  back to Gischala. </p>
<p>60. Now, in a few days, those ambassadors whom he had sent, came back again 
  and informed us, that the people were greatly provoked at Ananus, and Simon 
  the son of Gamaliel, and their friends; that, without any public determination, 
  they had sent to Galilee, and had done their endeavors that I might be turned 
  out of the government. The ambassadors said further, that the people were ready 
  to burn their houses. They also brought letters, whereby the chief men of Jerusalem, 
  at the earnest petition of the people, confirmed me in the government of Galilee, 
  and enjoined Jonathan and his colleagues to return home quickly. When I had 
  gotten these letters, I came to the village Arbela, where I procured an assembly 
  of the Galileans to meet, and bid the ambassadors declare to them the anger 
  of the people of Jerusalem at what had been done by Jonathan and his colleagues, 
  and how much they hated their wicked doings, and how they had confirmed me in 
  the government of their country, as also what related to the order they had 
  in writing for Jonathan and his colleagues to return home. So I immediately 
  sent them the letter, and bid him that carried it to inquire, as well as he 
  could, how they intended to act [on this occasion.] </p>
<p>61. Now, when they had received that letter, and were thereby greatly disturbed, 
  they sent for John, and for the senators of Tiberias, and for the principal 
  men of the Gabarens, and proposed to hold a council, and desired them to consider 
  what was to be done by them. However, the governors of Tiberias were greatly 
  disposed to keep the government to themselves; for they said it was not fit 
  to desert their city, now it was committed to their trust, and that otherwise 
  I should not delay to fall upon them; for they pretended falsely that so I had 
  threatened to do. Now John was not only of their opinion, but advised them, 
  that two of them should go to accuse me before the multitude [at Jerusalem], 
  that I do not manage the affairs of Galilee as I ought to do; and that they 
  would easily persuade the people, because of their dignity, and because the 
  whole multitude are very mutable. When, therefore, it appeared that John had 
  suggested the wisest advice to them, they resolved that two of them, Jonathan 
  and Ananias, should go to the people of Jerusalem, and the other two [Simon 
  and Joazar] should be left behind to tarry at Tiberins. They also took along 
  with them a hundred soldiers for their guard. </p>
<p>62. However, the governors of Tiberias took care to have their city secured 
  with walls, and commanded their inhabitants to take their arms. They also sent 
  for a great many soldiers from John, to assist them against me, if there should 
  be occasion for them. Now John was at Gischala. Jonathan, therefore, and those 
  that were with him, when they were departed from Tiberias, and as soon as they 
  were come to Dabaritta, a village that lay in the utmost parts of Galilee, in 
  the great plain, they, about midnight, fell among the guards I had set, who 
  both commanded them to lay aside their weapons, and kept them in bonds upon 
  the place, as I had charged them to do. This news was written to me by Levi, 
  who had the command of that guard committed to him by me. Hereupon I said nothing 
  of it for two days; and, pretending to know nothing about it, I sent a message 
  to the people of Tiberias, and advised them to lay their arms aside, and to 
  dismiss their men, that they might go home. But, supposing that Jonathan, and 
  those that were with him, were already arrived at Jerusalem, they made reproachful 
  answers to me; yet was I not terrified thereby, but contrived another stratagem 
  against them, for I did not think it agreeable with piety to kindle the fire 
  of war against the citizens. AS I WAS DESIRROUS TO DRAW THOSE MEN AWAY FROM 
  TIBERIUS, I chose out TEN THOUSAND of the best of my armed men, AND DIVIDED 
  THEM IN THREE BODIES, and ordered them to go privately, and lie still as an 
  ambush, in the villages. I also led a thousand into another village, which lay 
  indeed in the mountains, as did the others, but only four furlongs distant from 
  Tiberias; and gave orders, that when they saw my signal, they should come down 
  immediately, while I myself lay with my soldiers in the sight of every body. 
  Hereupon the people of Tiberias, at the sight of me, came running out of the 
  city perpetually, and abused me greatly. Nay, their madness was come to that 
  height, that they made a decent bier for me, and, standing about it, they mourned 
  over me in the way of jest and sport; and I could not but be myself in a pleasant 
  humor upon the sight of this madness of theirs. </p>
<p>63. And now being desirous to catch Simon by a wile, and Joazar with him, I 
  sent a message to them, and desired them to come a little way out of the city, 
  and many of their friends to guard them; for I said I would come down to them, 
  and make a league with them, and divide the government of Galilee with them. 
  Accordingly, Simon was deluded on account of his imprudence, and out of the 
  hopes of gain, and did not delay to come; but Joazar, suspecting snares were 
  laid for him, staid behind. So when Simon was come out, and his friends with 
  him, for his guard, I met him, and saluted him with great civility, and professed 
  that I was obliged to him for his coming up to me; but a little while afterward 
  I walked along with him as though I would say something to him by myself; and 
  when I had drawn him a good way from his friends, I took him about the middle, 
  and gave him to my friends that were with me, to carry him into a village; and, 
  commanding my armed men to come down, I WITH THEM MADE AN ASSAULT UPON TIBERIUS. 
  Now, as the fight grew hot on both sides, and the soldiers belonging to Tiberias 
  were in a fair way to conquer me, (FOR MY ARMED MEN WERE ALREADY FLED AWAY,) 
  I saw the posture of my affairs; and encouraging those that were with me, I 
  pursued those of Tiberias, even when they were already conquerors, into the 
  city. I also sent another band of soldiers into the city by the lake, and gave 
  them orders to set on fire the first house they could seize upon. When this 
  was done, the people of Tiberinas thought that their city was taken by force, 
  and so threw down their arms for fear, and implored, they, their wives, and 
  children, that I would spare their city. So I was over-persuaded by their entreaties, 
  and restrained the soldiers from the vehemency with which they pursued them; 
  while I myself, upon the coming on of the evening, returned back with my soldiers, 
  and went to refresh myself. I also invited Simon to sup with me, and comforted 
  him on occasion of what had happened; and I promised that I would send him safe 
  and SECURE TO JERUSALEM, AND WITHAL WOULD GIVE HIM PROVISIONS FOR HIS JOURNEY 
  THITHER. </p>
<p>64. But on the next day, I brought ten thousand armed men with me, and came 
  to Tiberias. I then sent for the principal men of the multitude into the public 
  place, and enjoined them to tell me who were the authors of the revolt; and 
  when they told me who the men were, I sent them bound to the city Jotapata. 
  But as to Jonathan and Ananias, I freed them from their bonds, and gave them 
  provisions for their journey, together with Simon and Joazar, and five hundred 
  armed men who should guard them; and so I sent them to Jerusalem. The people 
  of Tiberias also came to me again, and desired that I would forgive them for 
  what they had done; and they said they would amend what they had done amiss 
  with regard to me, by their fidelity for the time to come; and they besought 
  me to preserve what spoils remained upon the plunder of the city, for those 
  that had lost them. Accordingly, I enjoined those that had got them, to bring 
  them all before us; and when they did not comply for a great while, and I saw 
  one of the soldiers that were about me with a garment on that was more splendid 
  than ordinary, I asked him whence he had it; and when he replied that he had 
  it out of the plunder of the city, I had him punished with stripes; and I threatened 
  all the rest to inflict a severer punishment upon them, unless they produced 
  before us whatsoever they had plundered; and when a great many spoils were brought 
  together, I restored to every one of Tiberias what they claimed to be their 
  own. </p>
<p>65. AND NOW I AM COME TO THIS PART OF MY NARRATION, I HAVE A MIND TO SAY A 
  FEW THINGS TO JUSTUS, WHO HATH HIMSELF WRITTEN A HISTORY CONCERNING THESE AFFAIRS, 
  AND TO OTHERS WHO PROFESS TO WRITE HISTORY, BUT HAVE LITTLE REGARD FOR THE TRUTH, 
  and are not afraid, either out of ill-will or good-will to some persons, to 
  relate falsehoods. These men do like those who compose forged deeds and conveyances; 
  and because they are not brought to the like punishment with them, they have 
  no regard to truth. When, therefore, Justus undertook to write about these facts, 
  and about the Jewish war, that he might appear to have been an industrious man, 
  he falsified in what he related about me, and could not speak truth even about 
  his own country; whence it is that, being belied by him, I am under a necessity 
  to make my defense; and SO I SHALL SAY WHAT I HAVE CONCEALED TILL NOW. AND LET 
  NO ONE WONDER THAT I HAVE NOT TOLD THE WORLD THESE THINGS A GREAT WHILE AGO. 
  For although it be necessary for an historian to write the truth, yet is such 
  a one not bound severely to animadvert on the wickedness of certain men; not 
  out of any favor to them, but out of an author's own moderation. How then comes 
  it to pass, O Justus! thou most sagacious of writers, (that I may address myself 
  to him as if he were here present,) for so thou boastest of thyself, THAT I 
  AND THE GALILEANS HAVE BEEN THE AUTHORS OF THAT SEDITION WHICH THY COUNTRY ENGAGED 
  IN, both against the Romans and against the king [Agrippa, junior] For before 
  ever I was appointed GOVERNOR OF GALILEE BY THE COMMUNITY OF JERUSALEM, both 
  thou and all the people of Tiberias had not only taken up arms, but had made 
  war with DECAPOLIS OF SYRIA. Accordingly, thou hadst ordered their villages 
  to be burnt, and a domestic servant of thine fell in the battle. Nor is it I 
  only who say this; but so it is written in the Commentaries of Vespasian, the 
  emperor; as also how the inhabitants of Decapolis came clamoring to Vespasian 
  at Ptolemais, and desired that thou, who wast the author [of that war], mightest 
  be brought to punishment. And thou hadst certainly been punished at the command 
  of Vespasian, had not king Agrippa, who had power given him to have thee put 
  to death, at the earnest entreaty of his sister Bernice, changed the punishment 
  from death into a long imprisonment. Thy political administration of affairs 
  afterward doth also clearly discover both thy other behavior in life, and that 
  thou wast the occasion of thy country's revolt from the Romans; plain signs 
  of which I shall produce presently. I have also a mind to say a few things to 
  the rest of the people of Tiberias on thy account, and TO DEMONSTRATE TO THOSE 
  THAT LIGHT UPON THIS HISTORY, that you bare no good-will, neither to the Romans, 
  nor to the king. TO BE SURE, THE GREATEST CITIES OF GALILEE, O JUSTUS, WERE 
  SEPPHORIS, AND THY COUNTRY TIBERIUS. BUT SEPPHORIS, SITUATED IN THE VERY MIDST 
  OF GALILEE, and having many villages about it, and able with ease to have been 
  bold and troublesome to the Romans, if they had so pleased, yet did it resolve 
  to continue faithful to those their masters, and at the same time excluded me 
  out of their city, and prohibited all their citizens from joining with the Jews 
  in the war; and, that they might be out of danger from me, they, by a wile, 
  got leave of me to fortify their city with walls: they also, of their own accord, 
  admitted of a garrison of Roman legions, sent them by Cestlus Gallus, who was 
  then president of Syria, and so had me in contempt, though I was then very powerful, 
  and all were greatly afraid of me; AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE GREATEST OF 
  OUR CITIES, JERUSALEM, WAS BESIEGED, AND THAT TEMPLE OF OURS, WHICH BELONGED 
  TO US ALL, WAS IN DANGER OF FALLING UNDER THE ENEMY'S POWER, they sent no assistance 
  thither, as not willing to have it thought they would bear arms against the 
  Romans. But as for thy country, O Justus: situated UPON THE LAKE OF GENNESARETH, 
  and distance from Hippos THIRTY furlongs, from Gadara SIXTY, and from Scythopolis, 
  which was under the king's jurisdiction, A HUNDRED AND TWENTY; when there was 
  no Jewish city near, it might easily have preserved its fidelity [to the Romans,] 
  if it had so pleased them to do, for the city and its people had plenty of weapons. 
  But, as thou sayest, I was then the author [of their revolts]. And pray, O Justus! 
  who was that author afterwards? FOR THOU KNOWEST THAT I WAS IN THE POWER OF 
  THE ROMANS BEFORE JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED, and before the same time Jotapata 
  was taker by force, as well as many other fortresses, AND A GREAT MANY OF THE 
  GALILEANS FELL IN WAR. It was therefore then a proper time, when you were certainly 
  freed from any fear on my account, to throw away your weapons, and to demonstrate 
  to the king and to the Romans, that it was not of choice, but as forced by necessity, 
  that you fell into the war against them; but you staid till Vespasian came himself 
  as far as your walls, with his whole army; and then you did indeed lay aside 
  your weapons out of fear, and your city had for certain been taken by force, 
  unless Vespasian had complied with the king's supplication for you, and had 
  excused your madness. It was not I, therefore, who was the author of this, but 
  your own inclinations to war. Do not you remember how often I got you under 
  my power, and yet put none of you to death? Nay, you once fell into a tumult 
  one against another, and slew one hundred and eighty-five of your citizens, 
  not on account of your good-will to the king and to the Romans, but on account 
  of your own wickedness, and this while I was besieged by the Romans in Jotapata. 
  Nay, indeed, were there not reckoned up two thousand of the people of Tiberias 
  during the siege of Jerusalem, some of whom were slain, and the rest caught 
  and carried captives? But thou wilt pretend that thou didst not engage in the 
  war, since thou didst flee to the king. Yes, indeed, thou didst flee to him; 
  but I say it was out of fear of me. THOU SAYEST THAT IT IS I WHO AM A WICKED 
  MAN. But then, for what reason was it that king Agrippa, who procured thee thy 
  life when thou wast condemned to die by Vespian, and who bestowed so much riches 
  upon thee, did twice afterward put thee in bonds, and as often obliged thee 
  to run away from thy country, and, when he had once ordered thee to be put to 
  death, he granted thee a pardon at the earnest desire of Bernice? And when (after 
  so many of thy wicked pranks) he made thee his secretary, he caught thee falsifying 
  his epistles, and drove thee away from his sight. But I shall not inquire accurately 
  into these matters of scandal against thee. Yet cannot I but wonder at thy impudence, 
  when thou hast the assurance to say, that thou hast better related these affairs 
  [of the war] than have all the others that have written about them, whilst thou 
  didst not know what was done in Galilee; for thou wast then at Berytus with 
  the king; nor didst thou know how much the Romans suffered at the siege of Jotapata, 
  or what miseries they brought upon us; nor couldst thou learn by inquiry what 
  I did during that siege myself; for all those that might afford such information 
  were quite destroyed in that siege. But perhaps thou wilt say, thou hast written 
  of what was done against the people of Jerusalem exactly. But how should that 
  be? for neither wast thou concerned in that war, nor hast thou read the commentaries 
  of Caesar; of which we have evident proof, because thou hast contradicted those 
  commentaries of Caesar in thy history. But if thou art so hardy as to affirm, 
  that thou hast written that history better than all the rest, why didst thou 
  not publish thy history while the emperors Vespasian and Titus, the generals 
  in that war, as well as king Agrippa and his family, who were men very well 
  skilled in the learning of the Greeks, were all alive? for thou hast had it 
  written these twenty years, and then mightest thou have had the testimony of 
  thy accuracy. But now when these men are no longer with us, and thou thinkest 
  thou canst not be contradicted, thou venturest to publish it. But then I was 
  not in like manner afraid of my own writing, but I offered my books to the emperors 
  themselves, when the facts were almost under men's eyes; for I was conscious 
  to myself, that I had observed the truth of the facts; and as I expected to 
  have their attestation to them, so I was not deceived in such expectation. Moreover, 
  I immediately presented my history to many other persons, some of whom were 
  concerned in the war, as was king Agrippa and some of his kindred. Now the emperor 
  Titus was so desirous that the knowledge of these affairs should be taken from 
  these books alone, that he subscribed his own hand to them, and ordered that 
  they should be published; and for king Agrippa, he wrote me sixty-two letters, 
  and attested to the truth of what I had therein delivered; two of which letters 
  I have here subjoined, and thou mayst thereby know their contents: - &quot;King 
  Agrippa to Josephus, however, when thou comest to me, I will inform thee of 
  a great many things which thou dost not know.&quot; So when this history was 
  perfected, Agrippa, neither by way of flattery, which was not agreeable to him, 
  nor by way of irony, as thou wilt say, (for he was entirely a stranger to such 
  an evil disposition of mind,) but he wrote this by way of attestation to what 
  was true, as all that read histories may do. And so much shall be said concerning 
  Justus (24) which I am obliged to add by way of digression. </p>
<p>66. Now, when I had settled the affairs of Tiberias, AND HAD ASSEMBLED MY FRIENDS 
  AS A SANHEDRIM, I consulted what I should do as to John. Whereupon it appeared 
  to be the opinion of all the Galileans, that I should arm them all, and march 
  against John, and punish him as the author of all the disorders that had happened. 
  Yet was not I pleased with their determination; as purposing to compose these 
  troubles without bloodshed. Upon this I exhorted them to use the utmost care 
  to learn the names of all that were under John; which when they had done, and 
  I thereby was apprized who the men were, I published an edict, wherein I offered 
  security and my right hand to such of John's party as had a mind to repent; 
  and I allowed twenty days' time to such as would take this most advantageous 
  course for themselves. I also threatened, that unless they threw down their 
  arms, I would burn their houses, and expose their goods to public sale. When 
  the men heard of this, they were in no small disorder, and deserted John; and 
  to the number of four thousand threw down their arms, and came to me. So that 
  no others staid with John but his own citizens, and about fifteen hundred strangers 
  that came from the metropolis of Tyre; and when John saw that he had been outwitted 
  by my stratagem, he continued afterward in his own country, and was in great 
  fear of me.</p>

<p>67. But about this time it was that the people of Sepphoris grew insolent, 
  and took up arms, out of a confidence they had in the strength of their walls, 
  and because they saw me engaged in other affairs also. So they sent to Cestius 
  Gallus, who was president of Syria, and desired that he would either come quickly 
  to them, and take their city under his protection, or send them a garrison. 
  Accordingly, Gallus promised them to come, but did not send word when he would 
  come: and when I had learned so much, I took the soldiers that were with me, 
  AND MADE AN ASSAULT UPON THE PEOPLE OF SEPPHORIS, and took the city by force. 
  The Galileans took this opportunity, as thinking they had now a proper time 
  for showing their hatred to them, since they bore ill-will to that city also. 
  They then exerted themselves, as if they would destroy them all utterly, with 
  those that sojourned there also. So they ran upon them, and set their houses 
  on fire, as finding them without inhabitants; for the men, out of fear, ran 
  together to the citadel. So the Galileans carried off every thing, and omitted 
  no kind of desolation which they could bring upon their countrymen. WHEN I SAW 
  THIS, I WAS EXCEEDINGLY TROUBLED AT IT, and commanded them to leave off, and 
  put them in mind that it was not agreeable to piety to do such things to their 
  countrymen: but since they neither would hearken to what I exhorted, nor to 
  what I commanded them to do, (for the hatred they bore to the people there was 
  too hard for my exhortations to them,) I bade those my friends, who were most 
  faithful to me, and were about me, to give on reports, as if the Romans were 
  falling upon the other part of the city with a great army; and this I did, that, 
  by such a report being spread abroad, I might restrain the violence of the Galileans, 
  and preserve the city of Sepphoris. And at length this stratagem had its effect; 
  for, upon hearing this report, they were in fear for themselves, and so they 
  left off plundering and ran away; and this more especially, because they saw 
  me, their general, do the same also; for, that I might cause this report to 
  be believed, I pretended to be in fear as well as they. Thus were the inhabitants 
  of Sepphoris unexpectedly preserved by this contrivance of mine. </p>
<p>68. Nay, indeed, Tiberias had like to have been plundered by the Galileans 
  also upon the following occasion: - The chief men of the senate wrote to the 
  king, and desired that he would come to them, and take possession of their city. 
  The king promised to come, and wrote a letter in answer to theirs, and gave 
  it to one of his bed-chamber, whose name was Crispus, and who was by birth a 
  Jew, to carry it to Tiberias. When the Galileans knew that this man carried 
  such a letter, they caught him, and brought him to me; but as soon as the whole 
  multitude heard of it, they were enraged, and betook themselves to their arms. 
  So a great many of them together from all quarters the next day, and came to 
  the city Asochis, where I then lodged, and made heavy clamors, and called the 
  city of Tiberias a traitor to them, and a friend to the king; and desired leave 
  of me to go down and utterly destroy it; for they bore the like ill-will to 
  the people of Tiberias, as they did to those of Sepphoris. </p>
<p>69. When I heard this, I was in doubt what to do, and hesitated by what means 
  I might deliver Tiberias from the rage of the Galileans; for I could not deny 
  that those of Tiberias had written to the king, and invited him to come to them; 
  for his letters to them, in answer thereto, would fully prove the truth of that. 
  So I sat a long time musing with myself, and then said to them, &quot;I know 
  well enough that the people of Tiberias have offended; nor shall I forbid you 
  to plunder the city. However, such things ought to be done with discretion; 
  for they of Tiberias have not been the only BETRAYERS OF OUR LIBERTY, but many 
  of the most eminent patriots of the Galileans, as they pretended to be, have 
  done the same. TARRY THEREFORE TILL I SHALL THOROUGHLY FIND OUT THOSE AUTHORS 
  OF OUR DANGER, AND THEN YOU SHALL HAVE THEM ALL AT ONCE UNDER YOUR POWER <b>(compare 
  James, chapter 5)</b>, with all such as you shall yourselves bring in also.&quot; 
  Upon my saying this, I pacified the multitude, and they left off their anger, 
  and went their ways; and I gave orders that he who brought the king's letters 
  should be put into bonds; but in a few days I pretended that I was obliged, 
  by a necessary affair of my own, to go out of the kingdom. I then called Crispus 
  privately, and ordered him to make the soldier that kept him drunk, and to run 
  away to the king. So when Tiberias was in danger of being utterly destroyed 
  a second time, it escaped the danger BY MY SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT, AND THE CARE 
  THAT I HAD FOR ITS PRESERVATION. </p>
<p>70. About this time it was that Justus, the son of Pistus, without my knowledge, 
  ran away to the king; the occasion of which I will here relate. Upon the beginning 
  of the war between the Jews and Romans, the people of Tiberias resolved to submit 
  to the king, and not to revolt from the Romans; while Justus tried to persuade 
  them to betake themselves to their arms, as being himself desirous of innovations, 
  and having hopes of obtaining the government of Galilee, as well as of his own 
  country [Tiberias] also. Yet did he not obtain what he hoped for, because the 
  Galileans bore ill-will to those of Tiberias, and this on account of their anger 
  at what miseries they had suffered from them before the war; thence it was that 
  they would not endure that Justus should be their governor. I myself also, who 
  had been intrusted by the community of Jerusalem with the government of Galilee, 
  did frequently come to that degree of rage at Justus, that I had almost resolved 
  to kill him, as not able to bear his mischievous disposition. He was therefore 
  much afraid of me, lest at length my passion should come to extremity; so he 
  went to the king, as supposing that he would dwell better and more safely with 
  him. </p>
<p>71. Now, when the people of Sepphoris had, in so surprising a manner, escaped 
  their first danger, they sent to Cestius Gallus, and desired him to come to 
  them immediately, and take possession of their city, or else to send forces 
  sufficient to repress all their enemies' incursions upon them; and at the last 
  they did prevail with Gallus to send them a considerable army, both of horse 
  and foot, which came in the night time, and which they admitted into the city. 
  But when the country round about it was harassed by the Roman army, I took those 
  soldiers that were about me, and came to Garisme, where I cast up a bank, a 
  good way off the city Sepphoris; and when I was at twenty furlongs distance, 
  I came upon it by night, and made an assault upon its walls with my forces; 
  and when I had ordered a considerable number of my soldiers to scale them with 
  ladders, I became master of the greatest part of the city. But soon after, our 
  unacquaintedness with the places forced us to retire, after we had killed twelve 
  of the Roman footmen, and two horsemen, and a few of the people of Sepphoris, 
  with the loss of only a single man of our own. And when it afterwards came to 
  a battle in the plain against the horsemen, and we had undergone the dangers 
  of it courageously for a long time, we were beaten; for upon the Romans encompassing 
  me about, my soldiers were afraid, and fell back. There fell in that battle 
  one of those that had been intrusted to guard my body; his name was Justus, 
  who at this time had the same post with the king. At the same time also there 
  came forces, both horsemen and footmen, from the king, and Sylla their commander, 
  who was the captain of his guard: this Sylla pitched his camp at five furlongs' 
  distance from Julias, and set a guard upon the roads, both that which led to 
  Cana, and that which led to the fortress Gamala, that he might hinder their 
  inhabitants from getting provisions out of Galilee. </p>
<p>72. As soon as I had gotten intelligence of this, I sent two thousand armed 
  men, and a captain over them, whose name was Jeremiah, who raised a bank a furlong 
  off Julias, near to the river Jordan, and did no more than skirmish with the 
  enemy; till I took three thousand soldiers myself, and came to them. But on 
  the next day, when I had laid an ambush in a certain valley, not far from the 
  banks, I provoked those that belonged to the king to come to a battle, and gave 
  orders to my own soldiers to turn their backs upon them, until they should have 
  drawn the enemy away from their camp, and brought them out into the field, which 
  was done accordingly; for Sylla, supposing that our party did really run away, 
  was ready to pursue them, when our soldiers that lay in ambush took them on 
  their backs, and put them all into great disorder. I also immediately made a 
  sudden turn with my own forces, and met those of the king's party, and put them 
  to flight. And I had performed great things that day, if a certain fate had 
  not been my hinderance; FOR THE HORSE ON WHICH I RODE, AND UPON WHOSE BACK I 
  FOUGHT, FELL INTO A QUAGMIRE, AND THREW ME ON THE GROUND, and I was bruised 
  on my wrist, AND CARRIED INTO A VILLAGE NAMED Cepharnome, or CAPARNAUM. When 
  my soldiers heard of this, they were afraid I had been worse hurt than I was; 
  and so they did not go on with their pursuit any further, but returned in very 
  great concern for me. I THEREFORE SENT FOR THE PHYSICIANS, and while I was under 
  their hands, I continued feverish that day; and as the physicians directed, 
  I was that night removed to Taricheee. </p>
<p>73. When Sylla and his party were informed what happened to me, they took courage 
  again; and understanding that the watch was negligently kept in our camp, they 
  by night placed a body of horsemen in ambush beyond Jordan, and when it was 
  day they provoked us to fight; and as we did not refuse it, but came into the 
  plain, their horsemen appeared out of that ambush in which they had lain, and 
  put our men into disorder, and made them run away; so they slew six men of our 
  side. Yet did they not go off with the victory at last; for when they heard 
  that some armed men were sailed from Taricheae to Juli, they were afraid, and 
  retired. </p>
<p>74. It was not now long before Vespasian came to Tyre, and king Agrippa with 
  him; but the Tyrians began to speak reproachfully of the king, and called him 
  an enemy to the Romans. For they said that Philip, the general of his army, 
  had betrayed the royal palace and the Roman forces that were in Jerusalem, and 
  that it was done by his command. When Vespasian heard of this report, he rebuked 
  the Tyrians for abusing a man who was both a king and a friend to the Romans; 
  but he exhorted the king to send Philip to Rome, to answer for what he had done 
  before Nero. But when Philip was sent thither, he did not come into the sight 
  of Nero, for he found him very near death, on account of the troubles that then 
  happened, and a civil war; and so he returned to the king. But when Vespasian 
  was come to Ptolemais, the chief men of Decapolis of Syria made a clamor against 
  Justus of Tiberias, because he had set their villages on fire: so Vespasian 
  delivered him to the king, to be put to death by those under the king's jurisdiction; 
  yet did the king only put him into bonds, and concealed what he had done from 
  Vespasian, as I have before related. But the people of Sepphoris met Vespasian, 
  and saluted him, and had forces sent him, with Placidus their commander: he 
  also went up with them, as I also followed them, till Vespasian came into Galilee. 
  As to which coming of his, and after what manner it was ordered, and how he 
  fought his first battle with me near the village Taricheae, and how from thence 
  they went to Jotapata, and how I was taken alive, and bound, and how I was afterward 
  loosed, WITH ALL THAT WAS DONE TO ME IN THE JEWISH WAR, AND DURING THE SIEGE 
  OF JERUSALEM, I have accurately related them in the books concerning the War 
  of the Jews. However, it will, I think, he fit for me to add now an account 
  of those actions of my life which I have not related in that book of the Jewish 
  war. </p>
<p>75. For when the siege of Jotapata was over, AND I WAS AMONG THE ROMANS, I 
  WAS KEPT WITH MUCH CARE, by means of the great respect that Vespasian showed 
  me. Moreover, at his command, I MARRIED A VIRGIN <b>(I learned this mystery)</b>, 
  who was from among the captives of that country (25) yet did she not live with 
  me long, but was divorced, upon my being freed from my bonds, and my going to 
  Alexandria. However, I MARRIED ANOTHER WIFE AT ALEXANDRIA <b>(and I learned 
  these mysteries)</b>, and was thence sent, together with Titus, to the siege 
  of Jerusalem, and was frequently in danger of being put to death; while both 
  the Jews were very desirous to get me under their power, in order to have me 
  punished. And the Romans also, whenever they were beaten, supposed that it was 
  occasioned by my treachery, and made continual clamors to the emperors, and 
  desired that they would bring me to punishment, as a traitor to them: but Titus 
  Caesar was well acquainted with the uncertain fortune of war, and returned no 
  answer to the soldiers' vehement solicitations against me. Moreover, when the 
  city Jerusalem was taken by force, Titus Caesar persuaded me frequently to take 
  whatsoever I would of the ruins of my country; and did that he gave me leave 
  so to do. But when my country was destroyed, I thought nothing else to be of 
  any value, which I could take and keep as a comfort under my calamities; so 
  I made this request to Titus, that my family might have their liberty: I HAD 
  ALSO THE HOLY BOOKS (26) by Titus's concession. Nor was it long after that I 
  asked of him the life of my brother, and of fifty friends with him, and was 
  not denied. When I also went once to the temple, by the permission of Titus, 
  where there were a great multitude of captive women and children, I got all 
  those that I remembered as among my own friends and acquaintances to be set 
  free, being in number about one hundred and ninety; and so I delivered them 
  without their paying any price of redemption, and restored them to their former 
  fortune. And when I was sent by Titus Caesar with Cerealins, and a thousand 
  horsemen, to a certain village called Thecoa, in order to know whether it were 
  a place fit for a camp, as I came back, I SAW MANY CAPTIVES CRUCIFIED, and remembered 
  THREE OF THEM as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, 
  and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately 
  commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, 
  in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, 
  WHILE THE THIRD RECOVERED. </p>
<p>76. But when Titus had composed the troubles in Judea, and conjectured that 
  the lands which I had in Judea would bring me no profit, because a garrison 
  to guard the country was afterward to pitch there, he gave me another country 
  in the plain. And when he was going away to Rome, he made choice of me to sail 
  along with him, and paid me great respect: and when we were come to Rome, I 
  had great care taken of me by Vespasian; for he gave me an apartment in his 
  own house, which he lived in before he came to the empire. He also honored me 
  with the privilege of a Roman citizen, and gave me an annual pension; and continued 
  to respect me to the end of his life, without any abatement of his kindness 
  to me; which very thing made me envied, and brought me into danger; for a certain 
  Jew, whose name was Jonathan, who had raised a tumult in Cyrene, and had persuaded 
  two thousand men of that country to join with him, was the occasion of their 
  ruin. But when he was bound by the governor of that country, and sent to the 
  emperor, he told him that I had sent him both weapons and money. However, he 
  could not conceal his being a liar from Vespasian, who condemned him to die; 
  according to which sentence he was put to death. Nay, after that, when those 
  that envied my good fortune did frequently bring accusations against me, by 
  God's providence I escaped them all. I also received from Vespasian no small 
  quantity of land, as a free gift, in Judea; about which time I divorced my wife 
  also, as not pleased with her behavior, though not till she had been the mother 
  of three children, two of whom are dead, and one whom I named Hyrcanus, is alive. 
  AFTER THIS I MARRIED A WIFE WHO LIVED AT CRETE <b>(and now I discovered these 
  secrets)</b>, but a Jewess by birth: a woman she was of eminent parents, and 
  such as were the most illustrious in all the country, and whose character was 
  beyond that of most other women, as her future life did demonstrate. By her 
  I had two sons; the elder's name was Justus, and the next Simonides, who was 
  also named Agrippa. And these were the circumstances of my domestic affairs. 
  However, the kindness of the emperor to me continued still the same; for when 
  Vespasian was dead, Titus, who succeeded him in the government, kept up the 
  same respect for me which I had from his father; and when I had frequent accusations 
  laid against me, he would not believe them. And Domitian, who succeeded, still 
  augmented his respects to me; for he punished those Jews that were my accusers, 
  and gave command that a servant of mine, who was a eunuch, and my accuser, should 
  be punished. He also made that country I had in Judea tax free, which is a mark 
  of the greatest honor to him who hath it; nay, Domitia, the wife of Caesar, 
  continued to do me kindnesses. And this is the account of the actions of my 
  whole life; and let others judge of my character by them as they please. BUT 
  TO THEE, O EPAPHRODITUS, (27) THOU MOST EXCELLENT OF MEN! DO I DEDICATE ALL 
  THIS TREATISE OF OUR ANTIQUITIES; and so, for the present, I here conclude the 
  whole.</p>

  ENDNOTES</p>
<p>(1) We may hence correct the error of the Latin copy of the second book Against 
  Apion, sect. 8 (for the Greek is there lost,) which says, there were then only 
  four tribes or courses of the priests, instead of twenty-four. Nor is this testimony 
  to be disregarded, as if Josephus there contradicted what he had affirmed here; 
  because even the account there given better agrees to twenty-four than to four 
  courses, while he says that each of those courses contained above 5000 men, 
  which, multiplied by only four, will make not more than 20,000 priests; whereas 
  the number 120,000, as multiplied by 24, seems much the most probable, they 
  being about one-tenth of the whole people, even after the captivity. See Ezra 
  2:36-39; Nehemiah 7:39-42; 1 Esdras 5:24, 25, with Ezra 2;64; Nehemiah 7:66; 
  1 Esdras 5:41. Nor will this common reading or notion of but four courses of 
  priests, agree with Josephus's own further assertion elsewhere, Antiq. B. VII. 
  ch. 14. sect. 7, that David's partition of the priests into twenty-four courses 
  had continued to that day. </p>
<p>(2) An eminent example of the care of the Jews about their genealogies, especially 
  as to the priests. See Against Ap. B. 1 sect. 7. </p>
<p>(3) When Josephus here says, that from sixteen to nineteen, or for three years, 
  he made trial of the three Jewish sects, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the 
  Essens, and yet says presently, in all our copies, that he stayed besides with 
  one particular ascetic, called Banus, with him, and this still before he was 
  nineteen, there is little room left for his trial of the three other sects. 
  I suppose, therefore, that for, with him, the old reading might be, with them; 
  which is a very small emendation, and takes away the difficulty before us. Nor 
  is Dr. Hudson's conjecture, hinted at by Mr. Hall in his preface to the Doctor's 
  edition of Josephus, at all improbable, that this Banus, by this his description, 
  might well be a follower of John the Baptist, and that from him Josephus might 
  easily imbibe such notions, as afterwards prepared him to have a favorable opinion 
  of Jesus Christ himself, who was attested to by John the Baptist. </p>
<p>(4) We may note here, that religious men among the Jews, or at least those 
  that were priests, were sometimes ascetics also, and, like Daniel and his companions 
  in Babylon, Daniel 1:8-16, ate no flesh, but figs and nuts, etc. only. This 
  was like the, or austere diet of the Christian ascetics in Passion-week. Constitut. 
  V. 18. </p>
<p>(5) It has been thought the number of Paul and his companions on ship-board, 
  Acts 27:38, which are 276 in our copies, are too many; whereas we find here, 
  that Josephus and his companions, a very few years after the other, were about 
  600. </p>
<p>(6) See Jewish War, B. II. ch. 18. sect. 3. </p>
<p>(7) The Jews might collect this unlawfulness of fighting against their brethren 
  from that law of Moses, Leviticus 19:16, &quot;Thou shalt not stand against 
  the blood of thy neighbor;&quot; and that, ver. 17, &quot;Thou shalt not avenge, 
  nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love 
  thy neighbor as thyself;&quot; as well as from many other places in the Pentateuch 
  and Prophets. See Antiq. B. VIII. ch. 8. sect. 3. </p>
<p>(8) That this Herod Agrippa, the father, was of old called a Great King, as 
  here, appears by his coins still remaining; to which Havercamp refers us. </p>
<p>(9) The famous Jewish numbers of twelve and seventy are here remarkable. </p>
<p>(10) Our Josephus shows, both here and every where, that he was a most religious 
  person, and one that had a deep sense of God and his providence upon his mind, 
  and ascribed all his numerous and wonderful escapes and preservations, in times 
  of danger, to God's blessing him, and taking care of him, and this on account 
  of his acts of piety, justice, humanity, and charity, to the Jews his brethren. 
</p>
<p>(11) Josephus's opinion is here well worth noting: &#151; That every one is 
  to be permitted to worship God according to his own conscience, and is not to 
  be compelled in matters of religion: as one may here observe, on the contrary, 
  that the rest of the Jews were still for obliging all those who married Jewesses 
  to be circumcised, and become Jews, and were ready to destroy all that would 
  not submit to do so. See sect. 31, and Luke 11:54. </p>
<p>(12) How Josephus could say here that the Jewish laws forbade them to &quot;spoil 
  even their enemies, while yet, a little before his time, our Savior had mentioned 
  it as then a current maxim with them, &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and 
  hate thine enemy,&quot; Matthew 5:43, is worth our inquiry. I take it that Josephus, 
  having been now for many years an Ebionite Christian, had learned this interpretation 
  of the law of Moses from Christ, whom he owned for the true Melah, as it follows 
  in the succeeding verses, which, though he might not read in St. Matthew's Gospel, 
  yet might he have read much the same exposition in their own Ebionite or Nazarene 
  Gospel itself; of which improvements made by Josephus, after he was become a 
  Christian, we have already had several examples in this his life, sect. 3, 13, 
  15, 19, 21, 23, and shall have many more therein before its conclusion, as well 
  as we have them elsewhere in all his later writings. </p>
<p>(13) Here we may observe the vulgar Jewish notion of witchcraft, but that our 
  Josephus was too wise to give any countenance to it. </p>
<p>(14) In this section, as well as in the 18 and 33. those small vessels that 
  sailed on the sea of Galilee, are called by Josephus, i.e. plainly ships; so 
  that we need not wander at our evangelists, who still call them ships; nor ought 
  we to render them boats, as some do, Their number was in all 230, as we learn 
  from our author elsewhere. Jewish War. B. II. ch. 21. sect. 8. </p>
<p>(15) Part of these fortifications on Mount Tabor may be those still remaining, 
  and which were seen lately by Mr. Maundrel. See his Travels, p. 112. </p>
<p>(16) This Gamaliel may be the very same that is mentioned by the rabbins in 
  the Mishna, in Juchasin, and in Porta Mosis, as is observed in the Latin notes. 
  He might be also that Gamaliel II., whose grandfather was Gamaliel I., who is 
  mentioned in Acts 5:34, and at whose feet St. Paul was brought up, Acts 22:3. 
  See Prid. at the year 449. </p>
<p>(17) This Jonathan is also taken notice of in the Latin notes, as the same 
  that is mentioned by the rabbins in Porta Mosis. </p>
<p>(18) This I take to be the first OF JOSEPHUS'S REMARKABLE OR DIVINE DREAMS, 
  WHICH WERE PREDICTIVE OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT AFTERWARDS CAME TO PASS; of which 
  see more in the note on Antiq. B. III. ch. 8. sect. 9. The other is in the War, 
  B. III. ch. 8. sect. 3, 9. </p>
<p>(19) Josephus's directions to his soldiers here are much the same that John 
  the Baptist gave, Luke 3:14, &quot;Do violence to no man, neither accuse any 
  falsely, and be content with your wages.&quot; Whence Dr. Hudson confirms this 
  conjecture, that Josephus, in some things, was, even now, A FOLLOWER OF JOHN 
  THE BAPTIST, which is no way improbable. See the note on sect. 2. </p>
<p>(20) We here learn the practice of the Jews, in the days of Josephus, to inquire 
  into the characters of witnesses before they were admitted; and that their number 
  ought to be three, or two at the least, also exactly as in the law of Moses, 
  and in the Apostolical Constitutions, B. II. ch. 37. See Horeb Covenant Revived, 
  page 97, 98. </p>
<p>(21) This appeal to the whole body of the Galileans by Josephus, and the testimony 
  they gave him of integrity in his conduct as their governor, is very like that 
  appeal and testimony in the case of the prophet Samuel, 1 Samuel 12:1-5, and 
  perhaps was done by Josephus in imitation of him. </p>
<p>(22) It is worth noting here, that there was now a great Proseucha, or place 
  of prayer, in the city of Tiberias itself, though such Proseucha used to be 
  out of cities, as the synagogues were within them. Of them, see Le Moyne on 
  Polycarp's Epistle, page 76. It is also worth our remark, that the Jews, in 
  the days of Josephus, used to dine at the sixth hour, or noon; and that in obedience 
  to their notions of the law of Moses also. </p>
<p>(23) One may observe here, that this lay Pharisee, Ananias, is we have seen 
  he was, sect. 39, took upon him to appoint a fast at Tiberias, and was obeyed; 
  though indeed it was not out of religion, but knavish policy. </p>
<p>(24) The character of this history of Justus of Tiberias, the rival of our 
  Josephus, which is now lost, with its only remaining fragment, are given us 
  by a very able critic, Photius, who read that history. It is in the 33rd code 
  of his Bibliotheea, and runs thus: &quot;I have read (says Photius) the chronology 
  of Justus of Tiberias, whose title is this, [The Chronology of] the Kings of 
  Judah which succeeded one another. This [Justus] came out of the city of Tiberias 
  in Galilee. He begins his history from Moses, and ends it not till the death 
  of Agrippa, the seventh [ruler] of the family of Herod, and the last king of 
  the Jews; who took the government under Claudius, had it augmented under Nero, 
  and still more augmented by Vespasian. He died in the third year of Trajan, 
  where also his history ends. He is very concise in his language, and slightly 
  passes over those affairs that were most necessary to be insisted on; and being 
  under the Jewish prejudices, as indeed he was himself also a Jew by birth, HE 
  MAKES NOT THE LEAST MENTION OF THE APPEARANCE OF CHRIST, or what things happened 
  to him, or of the wonderful works that he did. He was the son of a certain Jew, 
  whose name was Pistus. He was a man, as he is described by Josephus, of a most 
  profligate character; a slave both to money and to pleasures. In public affairs 
  he was opposite to Josephus; and it is related, that he laid many plots against 
  him; but that Josephus, THOUGH HE HAD HIS ENEMY FREQUENTLY UNDER HS POWER, did 
  only reproach him in words, and so let him go without further punishment. He 
  says also, that the history which this man wrote is, for the main, fabulous, 
  and chiefly as to those parts where he describes the Roman war with the Jews, 
  and the taking of Jerusalem.&quot; </p>
<p>(25) Here Josephus, a priest, honestly confesses that he did that at the command 
  of Vespasian, which he had before told us was not lawful for a priest to do 
  by the law of Moses, Antiq. B. III. ch. 12. sect. 2. I mean, the taking a captive 
  woman to wife. See also Against Apion, B. I. sect. 7. But he seems to have been 
  quickly sensible that his compliance with the commands of an emperor would not 
  excuse him, for he soon put her away, as Reland justly observes here. </p>

<p align="center">THE WARS OF THE JEWS<br>
  OR </p>
<p align="center">THE HISTORY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM.<br>
  PREFACE</p>
<p align="left"><br>
  1. (1) WHEREAS THE WAR WHICH THE JEWS MADE WITH THE ROMANS HATH BEEN THE GREATEST 
  OF ALL THOSE, NOT ONLY THAT HAVE BEEN IN OUR TIMES, BUT, IN A MANNER, OF THOSE 
  THAT EVER WERE HEARD OF; BOTH OF THOSE WHEREIN CITIES HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST CITIES, 
  OR NATIONS AGAINST NATIONS; while some men who were not concerned in the affairs 
  themselves have gotten together vain and contradictory stories by hearsay, and 
  have written them down after a sophistical manner; and while those that were 
  there present have given false accounts of things, and this either out of a 
  humor of flattery to the Romans, or of hatred towards the Jews; and while their 
  writings contain sometimes accusations, and sometimes encomiums, but no where 
  the accurate truth of the facts; I have proposed to myself, for the sake of 
  such as live under the government of the Romans, to translate those books into 
  the Greek tongue, which I formerly composed in the language of our country, 
  AND SENT TO THE UPPER BARBARIANS; (2) Joseph, the son of Matthias, by birth 
  a Hebrew, a priest also, and one who at first fought against the Romans myself, 
  and was forced to be present at what was done afterwards, [am the author of 
  this work]. </p>
<p>2. NOW AT THE TIME WHEN THIS GREAT CONCUSSION OF AFFAIRS HAPPENED, THE AFFAIRS 
  OF THE ROMANS WERE THEMSELVES IN GREAT DISORDER. THOSE JEWS ALSO WHO WERE FOR 
  INNOVATIONS, THEN AROSE WHEN THE TIMES WERE DISTURBED; they were also in a flourishing 
  condition for strength and riches, insomuch that THE AFFAIRS OF THE EAST WERE 
  THEN EXCEEDING TUMULTUOUS, while some hoped for gain, and others were afraid 
  of loss in such troubles; for the Jews hoped that all of their nation which 
  were beyond Euphrates would have raised an insurrection together with them. 
  THE GAULS ALSO, IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE ROMANS, WERE IN MOTION, and the Geltin 
  were not quiet; but ALL WAS IN DISORDER AFTER THE DEATH OF NERO. And the opportunity 
  now offered induced many to aim at the royal power; and the soldiery affected 
  change, out of the hopes of getting money. I THOUGHT IT THEREFORE AN ABSURD 
  THING TO SEE THE TRUTH FALSIFIED IN AFFAIRS OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE, and to take 
  no notice of it; but to suffer those Greeks and Romans that were not in the 
  wars to be ignorant of these things, and to read either flatteries or fictions, 
  while the Parthians, and the Babylonians, and the remotest Arabians, and those 
  of our nation beyond Euphrates, with the Adiabeni, by my means, knew accurately 
  both whence the war begun, what miseries it brought upon us, and after what 
  manner it ended. </p>
<p>3. It is true, these writers have the confidence TO CALL THEIR ACCOUNTS HISTORIES; 
  wherein yet they seem to me to fail of their own purpose, AS WELL AS TO RELATE 
  NOTHING THAT IS SOUND. For they have a mind to demonstrate the greatness of 
  the Romans, while they still diminish and lessen the actions of the Jews, as 
  not discerning how it cannot be that those must appear to be great who have 
  only conquered those that were little. Nor are they ashamed to overlook the 
  length of the war, the multitude of the Roman forces who so greatly suffered 
  in it, or the might of the commanders, whose great labors about Jerusalem will 
  be deemed inglorious, if what they achieved be reckoned but a small matter. 
</p>
<p>4. However, I will not go to the other extreme, out of opposition to those 
  men who extol the Romans nor will I determine to raise the actions of my countrymen 
  too high; but I will prosecute the actions of both parties with accuracy. Yet 
  shall I suit my language to the passions I am under, as to the affairs I describe, 
  and must be allowed to indulge some lamentations upon the miseries undergone 
  by my own country. FOR THAT IT WAS A SEDITIOUS TEMPER OF OUR OWN THAT DESTROYED 
  IT, and that they were the tyrants among the Jews who brought the Roman power 
  upon us, who unwillingly attacked us, and occasioned THE BURNING OF OUR HOLY 
  TEMPLE, Titus Caesar, who destroyed it, is himself a witness, who, during the 
  entire war, pitied the people who were kept under by the seditious, and did 
  often voluntarily delay the taking of the city, and allowed time to the siege, 
  in order to let the authors have opportunity for repentance. But if any one 
  makes an unjust accusation against us, when we speak so passionately about the 
  tyrants, or the robbers, or sorely bewail the misfortunes of our country, let 
  him indulge my affections herein, though it be contrary to the rules for writing 
  history; because it had so come to pass, that our city Jerusalem had arrived 
  at a higher degree of felicity than any other city under the Roman government, 
  and yet at last fell into the sorest of calamities again. Accordingly, it appears 
  to me that the misfortunes of all men, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD, if they 
  be compared to these of the Jews (3) are not so considerable as they were; while 
  the authors of them were not foreigners neither. This makes it impossible for 
  me TO CONTAIN MY LAMENTATIONS. But if any one be inflexible in his censures 
  of me, let him attribute the facts themselves to the historical part, and the 
  lamentations to the writer himself only. </p>
<p>5. However, I may justly blame the learned men among the Greeks, who, when 
  such great actions have been done in their own times, which, upon the comparison, 
  quite eclipse the old wars, do yet sit as judges of those affairs, and pass 
  bitter censures upon the labors of the best writers of antiquity; which moderns, 
  although they may be superior to the old writers in eloquence, yet are they 
  inferior to them in the execution of what they intended to do. While these also 
  write new histories about the Assyrians and Medes, as if the ancient writers 
  had not described their affairs as they ought to have done; although these be 
  as far inferior to them in abilities as they are different in their notions 
  from them. For of old every one took upon them to write what happened in his 
  own time; where their immediate concern in the actions made their promises of 
  value; and where it must be reproachful to write lies, when they must be known 
  by the readers to be such. But then, an undertaking to preserve the memory Of 
  what hath not been before recorded, and to represent the affairs of one's own 
  time to those that come afterwards, is really worthy of praise and commendation. 
  Now he is to be esteemed to have taken good pains in earnest, not who does no 
  more than change the disposition and order of other men's works, but he who 
  not only relates what had not been related before, but composes an entire body 
  of history of his own: accordingly, I have been at great charges, and have taken 
  very great pains [about this history], though I be a foreigner; and do dedicate 
  this work, as a memorial of great actions, both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians. 
  But for some of our own principal men, their mouths are wide open, and their 
  tongues loosed presently, for gain and law-suits, but quite muzzled up when 
  they are to write history, where they must speak truth and gather facts together 
  with a great deal of pains; and so they leave the writing such histories to 
  weaker people, and to such as are not acquainted with the actions of princes. 
  Yet shall the real truth of historical facts be preferred by us, how much soever 
  it be neglected among the Greek historians. </p>
<p>6. TO WRITE CONCERNING THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS, WHO THEY WERE [originally], 
  AND HOW THEY REVOLTED FROM THE EGYPTIANS, AND WHAT COUNTRY THEY TRAVELED OVER, 
  AND WHAT COUNTRIES THEY SEIZED UPON AFTERWARDS, AND HOW THEY WERE REMOVED OUT 
  OF THEM, I THINK THIS NOT TO BE A FIT OPPORTUNITY, AND, ON OTHER ACCOUNTS, ALSO 
  SUPERFLUOUS; AND THIS BECAUSE MANY JEWS BEFORE ME HAVE COMPOSED THE HISTORIES 
  OF OUR ANCESTORS VERY EXACTLY, AS HAVE SOME OF THE GREEKS DONE IT ALSO, AND 
  HAVE TRANSLATED OUR HISTORIES INTO THEIR OWN TONGUE, AND HAVE NOT MUCH MISTAKEN 
  THE TRUTH IN THEIR HISTORIES. BUT THEN, WHERE THE WRITERS OF THESE AFFAIRS AND 
  OUR PROPHETS LEAVE OFF, THENCE SHALL I TAKE MY RISE, AND BEGIN MY HISTORY. Now 
  as to what concerns that war which happened in my own time, I will go over it 
  very largely, and with all the diligence I am able; but for what preceded mine 
  own age, that I shall run over briefly. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/IuDeA.gif" width="600" height="446"></p>
<p>7. [For example, I shall relate] HOW ANTIOCHUS, WHO WAS NAMED EPIPHANES, TOOK 
  JERUSALEM BY FORCE, AND HELD IT THREE YEARS AND THREE MONTHS, AND WAS THEN EJECTED 
  OUT OUT OF THE COUNTRY BY THE SONS OF ASAMONEUS: after that, how their posterity 
  quarreled about the government, and brought upon their settlement the Romans 
  and Pompey; how Herod also, the son of Antipater, dissolved their government, 
  and brought Sosins upon them; as also how our people made a sedition upon Herod's 
  death, while Augustus was the Roman emperor, and QUINILIUS VARUS WAS IN THAT 
  COUNTRY; and how the war broke out in the twelfth year of Nero, with what happened 
  to Cestius; AND WHAT PLACES THE JEWS ASSAULTED IN A HOSTILE MANNER IN THE FIRST 
  SALLIES OF THE WAR. </p>
<p>8. As also [I shall relate] how they built walls about the neighboring cities; 
  and how Nero, upon Cestius's defeat, was in fear of the entire event of the 
  war, and thereupon made Vespasian general in this war; and how this Vespasian, 
  with the elder of his sons (4) made an expedition into the country of Judea; 
  what was the number of the Roman army that he made use of; and how many of his 
  auxiliaries were cut off in all Galilee; and how he took some of its cities 
  entirely, and by force, and others of them by treaty, and on terms. Now, when 
  I am come so far, I shall describe the good order of the Romans in war, and 
  the discipline of their legions; the amplitude OF BOTH THE GALILEES, WITH ITS 
  NATURE, AND THE LIMITS OF JUDEA. And, besides this, I shall particularly go 
  over what is peculiar to the country, THE LAKES AND FOUNTAINS THAT ARE IN THEM, 
  and what miseries happened to every city as they were taken; and all this with 
  accuracy, as I saw the things done, or suffered in them. For I shall not conceal 
  any of the calamities I myself endured, since I shall relate them TO SUCH AS 
  KNOW THE TRUTH OF THEM. </p>
<p>9. After this, [I shall relate] how, When the Jews' affairs were become very 
  bad, Nero died, and Vespasian, when he was going to attack Jerusalem, was called 
  back to take the government upon him; what signs happened to him relating to 
  his gaining that government, and what mutations of government then happened 
  at Rome, and how he was unwillingly made emperor by his soldiers; and how, upon 
  his departure to Egypt, to take upon him the government of the empire, the affairs 
  of the Jews became very tumultuous; as also how the tyrants rose up against 
  them, and fell into dissensions among themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This was the course of events 
    in Palestine: for this is the name that has been given from old to the whole 
    country extending from Phoenicia to Egypt along the inner sea. They also have 
    another name that they have acquired: the country has been named Judaea, and 
    the people themselves Jews.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I do not know how this title came 
    to be given to them, but it applies also to the rest of mankind, although 
    of alien race, who affect their customs. This class exists even among the 
    Romans.&quot; </font>Dio's Roman History, 37<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p align="left">10. Moreover, [I shall relate] how Titus marched out of Egypt 
  into Judea the second time; as also how, and where, and how many forces he got 
  together; and in what state the city was, by the means of the seditious, at 
  his coming; what attacks he made, and how many ramparts he cast up; OF THE THREE 
  WALLS THAT ENCOMPASSED THE CITY, and of their measures; of the strength of the 
  city, AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE TEMPLE AND HOLY HOUSE; and besides, the measures 
  of those edifices, AND OF THE ALTAR, AND ALL ACCURATELY DETERMINED. A description 
  also of certain of their festivals, and seven purifications of purity, (5) and 
  the sacred ministrations of the priests, with the garments of the priests, and 
  of the high priests; AND OF THE NATURE OF THE MOST HOLY PLACE OF THE TEMPLE; 
  WITHOUT CONCEALING ANYTHING, OR ADDING ANYTHING TO THE KNOWN TRUTH OF THINGS</p>

</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now, anyone would justly 
    lament the destruction of such a work as this was, since it was the most admirable 
    of all the works which we have seen or heard of, both FOR ITS CURIOUS STRUCTURE 
    and ITS MAGNITUDE, and also for the vast wealth bestowed upon it, as well 
    as for the glorious reputation it had for holiness; yet might such a one comfort 
    himself with this thought, that it was fate that decreed it to be so, which 
    is inevitable, both as to living creatures and as to works and places also...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A false prophet was the occasion 
    of these people's destruction, who had made a public proclamation in the city 
    that very day, that God commanded them to get up upon the temple, and that 
    there they should receive a miraculous sign of their deliverance. Now there 
    was a great number of these false prophets suborned by the tyrants to impose 
    upon the people (as there are today), who denounced this to them, that they 
    should wait for deliverance from God; AND THIS WAS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM 
    DESERTING (see Ex.1:10), and that they might be buoyed up above fear and care 
    for such hopes. (See Ezekiel 13). Now a man that is in adversity does easily 
    comply with such promises; for when such a seducer makes him believe that 
    he shall be delivered from those miseries which oppress him, then it is that 
    the patient is full of hopes of such a deliverance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus were the miserable people 
    persuaded by these deceivers, and such as belied God Himself; WHILE THEY DID 
    NOT ATTEND, NOR GIVE CREDIT TO THE SIGNS THAT WERE SO EVIDENT, AND DID SO 
    PLAINLY TELL THEIR FUTURE DESOLATION. But like men infatuated, without either 
    eyes to see or minds to consider, did not regard the denunciation that God 
    made to them. Thus THERE WAS A STAR RESEMBLING A SWORD (Haley's Comet), which 
    stood over the city, and a comet that continued a whole year. Thus also, before 
    the Jews rebelled, and before these commotions which preceded the war, when 
    the people were come in great crowds to the feast of Unleavened Bread (see 
    1Corinth.5:17; Col.2:16-23; 3:1-6), SO GREAT A LIGHT SHONE ROUND ABOUT THE 
    ALTAR AND THE HOLY HOUSE THAT IT APPEARED TO BE BRIGHT DAYTIME; which light 
    lasted HALF AN HOUR (or half a circle, from East to West, see Revelation 8:1). 
    This light seemed to be a good sign to the unskillful, but was so interpreted 
    by the sacred scribes as to portend those events that followed immediately 
    upon it. At the same time a Heifer, as she was led by the High Priest to be 
    sacrificed, BROUGHT FORTH A LAMB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TEMPLE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, at the eastern gate of 
    the INNER court, which was of brass, and vastly heavy, and had been with difficulty 
    shut by 20 men, and rested upon a basis armed with iron, and had bolts fastened 
    very deep into the firm floor, which was there made OF ONE ENTIRE STONE, was 
    seen to be opened of its own accord ABOUT THE SIXTH HOUR of the ...This also 
    appeared to the vulgar to be a very happy prodigy, as if God did thereby open 
    the Gate of Happiness. But the mean of learning understood it, that the security 
    of their Holy House was dissolved and that the gate was opened for the advantage 
    of their enemy...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides these...a certain prodigious 
    and incredible phenomenon appeared; I suppose the accounts of it would seem 
    to be a fable, were it not related by those who saw it, and were not the events 
    that followed it of so considerable a nature to deserve such signals; FOR 
    BEFORE THE SETTING OF THE SUN (in the West, see John 1:51), CHARIOTS AND TROOPS 
    OF SOLDIERS WERE SEEN RUNNING ABOUT AMONG THE CLOUDS, and surrounding cities. 
    Moreover at the feast which we call Pentecost, AS THE PRIESTS WERE GOING BY 
    NIGHT INTO THE INNER COURT OF THE TEMPLE, as their custom was, to perform 
    their sacred ministrations, they said that in the first place, they felt a 
    quaking and heard a great noise (like the Noise of the entire 20th century) 
    and after that they heard the sound as of a great multitude, saying, &quot;LET 
    US REMOVE HENCE.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what is still more terrible, 
    there was one Jesus, the son of Ananus, who, for four years before the war 
    began, and at a time when the city was in great peace and prosperity, came 
    to the feast whereon it is our custom to make TABERNACLES to God in the temple 
    (please notice that Josephus has taken his narrative from Passover in the 
    East, to Pentecost above, to Tabernacles in the West), and began on a sudden 
    to cry aloud:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A voice from the East, a voice 
    from the West, a voice from the Four Winds, a voice against Jerusalem and 
    the holy house, a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice 
    against this whole people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus was his cry, as he went about 
    day and night in all the lanes of the city. However, certain of the most eminent 
    of the populace had great indignation at this dire cry of his, and took up 
    the man and gave him a great number of severe stripes yet he did not make 
    any supplication for himself, nor shed any tears, but turning his voice to 
    the most lamentable tone possible, at the very stroke of the whip his answer 
    was 'Woe to Jerusalem</font>.'</p>

    he will find that God takes care of mankind and by all ways possible foreshows 
    to our race what is for their preservation; but that men perish by those miseries

    the tower of Antonia, had made their temple Foursquare, while at the same

<p align="left">11. After this, I shall relate the barbarity of the tyrants towards 
  the people of their own nation, as well as the indulgence of the Romans in sparing 
  foreigners; and how often Titus, out of his desire to preserve the city and 
  the temple, invited the seditious to come to terms of accommodation. I shall 
  also distinguish the sufferings of the people, and their calamities; how far 
  they were afflicted by the sedition, and how far by the famine, and at length 
  were taken. Nor shall I omit to mention the misfortunes of the deserters, nor 
  the punishments inflicted on the captives; as also how the temple was burnt, 
  against the consent of Caesar; and how many sacred things that had been laid 
  up in the temple were snatched out of the fire; THE DESTRUCTION ALSO OF THE 
  ENTIRE CITY, WITH THE SIGNS AND WONDERS THAT WENT BEFORE IT; and the taking 
  the tyrants captives, AND THE MULTITUDES OF THOSE THAT WERE MADE SLAVES, and 
  into what different misfortunes they were every one distributed. Moreover, what 
  the Romans did to the remains of the wall; and how they demolished the strong 
  holds that were in the country; and how Titus went over the whole country, and 
  settled its affairs; together with his return into Italy, and his triumph. </p>
<p>12. I have comprehended ALL THESE THINGS IN SEVEN BOOKS, and have left no occasion 
  for complaint or accusation to such as have been acquainted with this war; AND 
  I HAVE WRITTEN IT DOWN FOR THOSE THAT LOVE TRUTH, but not for those that please 
  themselves [with fictitious relations]. And I will begin my account of these 
  things with what I call my First Chapter. </p>
<p>ENDNOTES</p>
<p>(1) I have already observed more than once, that this History of the Jewish 
  War was Josephus's first work, and published about A.D. 75, when he was but 
  thirty-eight years of age; and that when he wrote it, HE WAS NOT THOROUGHLY 
  ACQUAINTED WITH SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF HISTORY from the days of Antiochus 
  Epiphanes, with which it begins, till near his own times, contained in the first 
  and former part of the second book, AND SO COMMITTED MANY <i>INVOLUNTARY</i> 
  ERRORS THEREIN. That he published his Antiquities eighteen years afterward, 
  in the thirteenth year of Domitian, A.D. 93, when he was much more completely 
  acquainted with those ancient times, and after he had perused those most authentic 
  histories, the First Book of Maccabees, and the Chronicles of the Priesthood 
  of John Hyrcanus, etc. That accordingly he then reviewed those parts of this 
  work, and gave the public a more faithful, complete, and accurate account of 
  the facts therein related; and honestly corrected the errors he had before run 
  into. </p>
<p>(2) WHO THESE UPPER BARBARIANS, REMOTE FROM THE SEA, WERE, Josephus himself 
  will inform us, sect. 2, viz. the Parthians and Babylonians, AND REMOTEST ARABIANS 
  [of the Jews among them]; besides the Jews beyond Euphrates, and the Adiabeni, 
  or Assyrians. Whence we also learn that these Parthians, Babylonians, the remotest 
  Arabians, [or at least the Jews among them,] as also the Jews beyond Euphrates, 
  and the Adiabeni, or Assyrians, understood Josephus's Hebrew, or rather Chaldaic, 
  books of The Jewish War, before they were put into the Greek language. </p>
<p>(3) That these calamities of the Jews, <i>who were our Savior&#146;s murderers</i>, 
  were to be the greatest that had ever been since the beginning of the world, 
  our Savior had directly foretold, Matthew 24:21; Mark 13:19; Luke 21:23, 24; 
  and that they proved to be such accordingly, Josephus is here a most authentic 
  witness. </p>
<p>(4) Titus. </p>
<p>(5) These seven, or rather five, degrees of purity, or purification, are enumerated 
  hereafter, B. V. ch. 5. sect. 6. The Rabbins make ten degrees of them, as Reland 
  there informs us.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">PREFACE TO THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS</font></p>
<p>1. THOSE WHO UNDERTAKE TO WRITE HISTORIES, do not, I perceive, take that trouble 
  on one and the same account, but for many reasons, and those such as are very 
  different one from another. For some of them apply themselves to this part of 
  learning to show their skill in composition, and that they may therein acquire 
  a reputation for speaking finely: others of them there are, who write histories 
  IN ORDER TO GRATIFY THOSE THAT HAPPEN TO BE CONCERNED IN THEM, AND ON THIS ACCOUNT 
  HAVE SPARED NO PAINS, BUT RATHER GONE BEYOND THEIR OWN ABILITIES IN THE PERFORMANCE: 
  but others there are, who, OF NECESSITY AND BY FORCE, ARE DRIVEN TO WRITE HISTORY, 
  BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED IN THE FACTS, and so cannot excuse themselves from 
  committing them to writing, for the advantage of posterity; NAY, THERE ARE A 
  FEW WHO ARE INDUCED TO DRAW THEIR HISTORICAL FACTS OUT OF DARKNESS INTO LIGHT, 
  and to produce them for the benefit of the public, on account of the great importance 
  of the facts themselves with which they have been concerned. Now of these several 
  reasons for writing history, I must profess the two last were my own reasons 
  also; for since I was myself interested in that war which we Jews had with the 
  Romans, and knew myself its particular actions, and what conclusion it had, 
  I was forced to give the history of it, because I saw that others perverted 
  the truth of those actions in their writings. </p>
<p>2. Now I have undertaken the present work, as thinking it will appear to all 
  the Greeks (2) worthy of their study; FOR IT WILL CONTAIN ALL OUR ANTIQUITIES, 
  AND THE CONSTITUTION OF OUR GOVERNMENT, AS INTERPRETED OUT OF THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES. 
  And indeed I did formerly intend, when I wrote of the war, (3) TO EXPLAIN WHO 
  THE JEWS ORIGINALLY WERE, - what fortunes they had been subject to, - and by 
  what legislature they had been instructed in piety, and the exercise of other 
  virtues, - what wars also they had made in remote ages, till they were unwillingly 
  engaged in this last with the Romans: but because this work would take up a 
  great compass, I separated it into a set treatise by itself, with a beginning 
  of its own, and its own conclusion; but in process of time, as usually happens 
  to such as undertake great things, I grew weary and went on slowly, it being 
  a large subject, AND A DIFFICULT THING TO TRANSLATE OUR HISTORY INTO A FOREIGN, 
  AND TO US UNACCUSTOMED LANGUAGE. However, some persons there were who desired 
  to know our history, and so exhorted me to go on with it; and, above all the 
  rest, Epaphroditus, (4) a man who is a lover of all kind of learning, but is 
  principally delighted with the knowledge of history, and this on account of 
  his having been himself concerned in great affairs, and many turns of fortune, 
  and having shown a wonderful rigor of an excellent nature, and an immovable 
  virtuous resolution in them all. I yielded to this man's persuasions, who always 
  excites such as have abilities in what is useful and acceptable, to join their 
  endeavors with his. I was also ashamed myself to permit any laziness of disposition 
  to have a greater influence upon me, than the delight of taking pains in such 
  studies as were very useful: I thereupon stirred up myself, and went on with 
  my work more cheerfully. Besides the foregoing motives, I had others which I 
  greatly reflected on; and these were, that our forefathers were willing to communicate 
  such things to others; and that some of the Greeks took considerable pains to 
  know the affairs of our nation. </p>
<p align="center">THE SEPTUAGINT</p>
<p>3. I found, therefore, that the second of the Ptolemies was a king who was 
  extraordinarily diligent in what concerned learning, and the collection of books; 
  that he was also peculiarly ambitious to procure a translation of our law, and 
  of the constitution of our government therein contained, into the Greek tongue. 
  Now Eleazar the high priest, one not inferior to any other of that dignity among 
  us, did not envy the forenamed king the participation of that advantage, which 
  otherwise he would for certain have denied him, but that he knew the custom 
  of our nation was, to hinder nothing of what we esteemed ourselves from being 
  communicated to others. Accordingly, I thought it became me both to imitate 
  the generosity of our high priest, and to suppose there might even now be many 
  lovers of learning like the king; FOR HE DID NOT OBTAIN ALL OUR WRITINGS AT 
  THAT TIME; but those who were sent to Alexandria as interpreters, gave him ONLY 
  THE BOOKS OF THE LAW, while there were a vast number of other matters in our 
  sacred books. They, indeed, contain in them the history of five thousand years; 
  in which time happened many strange accidents, many chances of war, and great 
  actions of the commanders, and mutations of the form of our government. Upon 
  the whole, a man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from it, 
  that all events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the reward of 
  felicity is proposed by God; but then it is to those that follow his will, and 
  do not venture to break his excellent laws: and that so far as men any way apostatize 
  from the accurate observation of them, what was practical before becomes impracticable 
  (5) and whatsoever they set about as a good thing, is converted into an incurable 
  calamity. AND NOW I EXHORT ALL THOSE THAT PERUSE THESE BOOKS, TO APPLY THEIR 
  MINDS TO GOD; AND TO EXAMINE THE MIND OF OUR LEGISLATOR <b>(things hidden and 
  things revealed)</b>, whether he hath not understood his nature in a manner 
  worthy of him; and hath not ever ascribed to him such operations as become his 
  power, and hath not preserved his writings from those indecent fables which 
  others have framed, although, by the great distance of time when he lived, he 
  might have securely forged such lies; for he lived two thousand years ago; at 
  which vast distance of ages the poets themselves have not been so hardy as to 
  fix even the generations of their gods, much less the actions of their men, 
  or their own laws. As I proceed, therefore, I shall accurately describe what 
  is contained in our records, in the order of time that belongs to them; for 
  I have already promised so to do throughout this undertaking; and this without 
  adding any thing to what is therein contained, or taking away any thing therefrom. 
</p>
<p>4. But because almost all our constitution depends on the wisdom of Moses, 
  our legislator, I cannot avoid saying somewhat concerning him beforehand, though 
  I shall do it briefly; I mean, because otherwise those that read my book may 
  wonder how it comes to pass, that my discourse, which promises an account of 
  laws and historical facts, contains so much of philosophy. The reader is therefore 
  to know, that Moses deemed it exceeding necessary, that he who would conduct 
  his own life well, and give laws to others, IN THE FIRST PLACE SHOULD CONSIDER 
  THE DIVINE NATURE; AND, UPON THE CONTEMPLATION OF GOD'S OPERATIONS, SHOULD THEREBY 
  IMITATE THE BEST OF ALL PATTERNS, SO FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR HUMAN NATURE 
  TO DO, and to endeavor to follow after it: neither could the legislator himself 
  have a right mind without such a contemplation; nor would any thing he should 
  write tend to the promotion of virtue in his readers; I mean, unless they be 
  taught first of all, that God is the Father and Lord of all things, and sees 
  all things, and that thence he bestows a happy life upon those that follow him; 
  but plunges such as do not walk in the paths of virtue into inevitable miseries. 
  Now when Moses was desirous to teach this lesson to his countrymen, he did not 
  begin the establishment of his laws after the same manner that other legislators 
  did; I mean, upon contracts and other rights between one man and another, BUT 
  BY RAISING THERE MINDS UPWARDS TO REGARD GOD, AND HIS CREATION OF THE WORLD; 
  and by persuading them, that we men are the most excellent of the creatures 
  of God upon earth. Now when once he had brought them to submit to religion, 
  he easily persuaded them to submit in all other things: for as to other legislators, 
  they followed fables, and by their discourses transferred the most reproachful 
  of human vices unto the gods, AND AFFORDED WICKED MEN THE MOST PLAUSIBLE EXCUSES 
  FOR THEIR CRIMES; but as for our legislator, when he had once demonstrated that 
  God was possessed of perfect virtue, he supposed that men also ought to strive 
  after the participation of it; and on those who did not so think, and so believe, 
  he inflicted the severest punishments. I EXHORT, THEREFORE, MY READERS TO EXAMINE 
  THIS WHOLE UNDERTAKING IN THIS VIEW; for thereby it will appear to them, that 
  there is nothing therein disagreeable either to the majesty of God, or to his 
  love to mankind; FOR ALL THINGS HAVE HERE A REFERENCE TO THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE; 
  while our legislator speaks some things WISELY, BUT ENIGMATICALLY, and others 
  under a decent ALLEGORY, but still explains SUCH THINGS AS REQUIRED a direct 
  explication PLAINLY AND EXPRESSLY. However, those that have a mind to know the 
  reasons of every thing, MAY FIND HERE A VERY CURIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY, which 
  I now indeed shall wave the explication of; but if God afford me time for it, 
  I will set about writing it (6) after I have finished the present work. I shall 
  now betake myself to the history before me, after I have first mentioned what 
  Moses says of the creation of the world, which I find described in the sacred 
  books after the manner following. </p>
