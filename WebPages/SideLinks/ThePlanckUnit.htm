  <p><font size="+1">WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE BIG BANG?</font><br>
    By DENNIS OVERBYE </p>
</div>
<p>Like baseball, in which three strikes make an out, three outs on a side make 
  an inning, nine innings make a regular game, the universe makes its own time. 
  There is no outside timekeeper. Space and time are part of the universe, not 
  the other way around, thinkers since Augustine have said, and that is one of 
  the central and haunting lessons of Einstein's general theory of relativity.</p>
<p>In explaining gravity as the &quot;bending&quot; of space-time geometry, Einstein's 
  theory predicted the expansion of the universe, the primal fact of 20th-century 
  astronomy. By imagining the expansion going backward, like a film in reverse, 
  cosmologists have traced the history of the universe credibly back to a millionth 
  of a second after the Big Bang that began it all. But to ask what happened before 
  the Big Bang is a little bit like asking who was on base before the first pitch 
  was thrown out in a game, say between the Yankees and the Red Sox. There was 
  no &quot;then&quot; then. </p>
<p>Still, this has not stopped some theorists with infinity in their eyes from 
  trying to imagine how the universe made its &quot;quantum leap from eternity 
  into time,&quot; as the physicist Dr. Sidney Coleman of Harvard once put it. 
  Some physicists speculate that on the other side of the looking glass of Time 
  Zero is another universe going backward in time. Others suggest that creation 
  as we know it is punctuated by an eternal dance of clashing island universes.</p>
<p>In their so-called quantum cosmology, Dr. Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge University 
  physicist and author, and his collaborators envision the universe as a kind 
  of self-contained entity, a crystalline melt of all possibilities existing in 
  &quot;imaginary time.&quot; All these will remain just fancy ideas <b>until 
  physicists have married Einstein's gravity to the paradoxical quantum laws that 
  describe behavior of subatomic particles</b>. Such a theory of <b>quantum gravity</b>, 
  scientists agree, is needed to describe the universe when it was so small and 
  dense that even space and time become fuzzy and discontinuous. &quot;Our clocks 
  and our rulers break,&quot; as Dr. Andrei Linde, a Stanford cosmologist likes 
  to put it.</p>
<p><b>At the moment there are two pretenders to the throne of that ultimate theory</b>. 
  One is string theory, the putative &quot;theory of everything,&quot; which posits 
  that the ultimate constituents of nature are tiny vibrating strings rather than 
  points. String theorists have scored some striking successes in the study of 
  black holes, in which matter has been compressed to catastrophic densities similar 
  to the Big Bang, but they have made little progress with the Big Bang itself.</p>
<p>String's lesser-known rival, called loop quantum gravity, is the result of 
  applying quantum strictures directly to Einstein's equations. This theory makes 
  no pretensions to explaining anything but gravity and space-time. But recently 
  Dr. Martin Bojowald of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in 
  Golm, Germany, found that using the theory <b>he could follow the evolution 
  of the universe back past the alleged beginning point</b>. Instead of having 
  a &quot;zero moment&quot; of infinite density &#151; a so-called singularity 
  &#151; the universe instead behaved as if it were contracting from an earlier 
  phase, according to the theory, he said. As if the Big Bang were a big bounce.</p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TSIMTSUN (CONTRACTION OR WITHDRAWAL) 
    &quot;Luria pondered the question of beginnings. How did the process of EMANATION 
    start? If Ein Sof pervaded all space, how was there room for anything other 
    than God to come into being? Elaborating on earlier formulations, Lauria taught 
    that the first divine act was not emanation, but withdral. Ein Sof (the Incomprehensible) 
    withdrew its presence &quot;from itself to itself,&quot; withdrawing in all 
    directions away from one point at the center of its infinity, as it were, 
    thereby creating a vacuum. This vacuum served as the site of creation...Into 
    the vacuum Ein Sof emanated a ray of Light (Energy), channeled through vessels 
    (the ten sifirot)...As the emanation proceeded, some of the vessels...shattered. 
    Most of the Light (remained in its original form...while the shattered sparks 
    became trapped in material existence). The human task is to liberate, or raise, 
    these sparks, to restore them to divinity.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their dreams, theorists of both stripes hope that they will discover that 
  they have been exploring <b>the Janus faces of a single idea, yet unknown</b>, 
  but which might explain how time, space and everything else can be built out 
  of nothing. A prescription for, as the physicist Dr. John Archibald Wheeler 
  of Princeton puts it, <b>&quot;law without law.&quot; (THE TAO)</b>.</p>
<p>Dr. Wheeler himself, the pre-eminent poet-adventurer in physics, has put forth 
  his own proposal. According to quantum theory's famous uncertainty principle, 
  the properties of a subatomic particle like its momentum or position remain 
  in abeyance, in a sort of fog of possibility until something measures it or 
  hits it. Likewise he has wondered out loud if the universe bootstraps itself 
  into being by the accumulation of billions upon billions of quantum interactions 
  &#151; the universe stepping on its own feet, microscopically, and bumbling 
  itself awake.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> (tch tch)</font>. <b>It's 
  a notion he once called &quot;genesis by observership,&quot;</b> but now calls 
  &quot;it from bit&quot; to emphasize a proposed connection between quantum mechanics 
  and information theory.</p>
<p>One implication of quantum genesis, if it is correct, is that the notion of 
  the creation of the universe as something far away and long ago must go. &quot;The 
  past is theory,&quot; Dr. Wheeler once wrote. <b>&quot;It has no existence except 
  in the records of the present. We are all participators, at the microscopic 
  level, in making that past as well as the present and the future.&quot;</b></p>
<p>If the creation of the universe happens outside time, then it must happen all 
  the time. <b>The Big Bang is here and now, the foundation of every moment. And 
  you are there</b>.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">WHAT IS GRAVITY, REALLY?</font><br>
  By DENNIS OVERBYE</p>
<p>Gravity...it's not just a good idea. <b>It's the Law,&quot;</b> reads a popular 
  bumper sticker. Gravity is our oldest and most familiar enemy, the force we 
  feel in our bones, the force that will eventually bury us, sagging our organs 
  and pulling us down, <b>but for all its intimacy, it is a mystery. What really 
  is the law?</b></p>
<p>For most of us it's the one that Isaac Newton proclaimed in 1687 as the rule 
  of the cosmos, <b>describing how (but not why) two objects attract each other</b> 
  with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the 
  distance between them. But it's been rewritten and physicists expect that it 
  will be rewritten again.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg06.gif" width="662" height="301"></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="+1">0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 = 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="+1">QUANTUM TIME (A GUAGE PARTICLE)</font></b></p>
<p>Newton's gravity was replaced by Einstein's general theory of relativity early 
  in the 20th century. Einstein suggested that matter and energy warp space-time 
  the way a heavy sleeper sags a cheap mattress, causing planets, basketballs 
  and light beams to move in curved paths instead of straight lines. <b>General 
  relativity predicted the bending of light, the expansion of the universe and 
  black holes, and has served as the foundation for modern cosmology</b>, but 
  theorists have never presumed that it would be the last word on gravity. For 
  one thing, it is mathematically incompatible with the quantum laws that govern 
  subatomic particles. In order to describe what happens at very small distances 
  or very high energies corresponding to the first moments after the Big Bang, 
  <b>where space and time become discontinuous, general relativity has to be merged 
  with quantum theory</b>, a project that has engrossed the present generation 
  of physicists.</p>
<p>But recently some experts have been wondering out loud if it is time to rewrite 
  Einstein's version of the law as it applies to the other end of the length scale, 
  to very long distances. The motivation comes from the predominance of <b>what 
  is sometimes called &quot;THE DARK SECTOR&quot; in the universe</b>. According 
  to what has recently become a highly celebrated &quot;standard model,&quot; 
  ordinary atoms make up only 5 percent of the &quot;stuff&quot; of the cosmos. 
  <b>Some kind of mysterious dark matter, perhaps consisting of elementary particles 
  left over from the Big Bang, makes up 25 percent, while the rest &#151; a whopping 
  70 percent &#151; consists of something even more mysterious, known as &quot;dark 
  energy.&quot;</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">He made Darkness his secret place; his pavilions round 
    about him were Dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies...</font></i><font size="+1">(Psalm 
    18:11). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Obviously a theory that leaves 95 percent of the universe unexplained is 
  less than a complete triumph.</b></p>
<p><b>Neither dark energy nor dark matter has been observed or detected directly. 
  Each has been inferred from its gravitational effects on the tiny fraction of 
  stuff we can see</b>. As a result, some scientists have suggested that what 
  astronomers have discovered in the last 20 years is their own ignorance of gravity. 
  <b>In particular, the discovery, five years ago, that the expansion of the universe 
  is apparently accelerating, under the influence of that dark energy, has occasioned 
  a re-evaluation of the old certainties.</b></p>
<p>The simplest explanation for dark energy is something called the cosmological 
  constant, first invented by Einstein, a cosmic repulsion caused by the energy 
  residing in empty space. But attempts to calculate this energy have resulted 
  in numbers 1060 bigger than what astronomers have measured &#151; so large that 
  the universe would have blown apart before atoms or galaxies could have formed 
  &#151; causing theorists to throw up their hands. <b>&quot;I think we are so 
  confused that we should keep an open mind to tinkering with gravity,&quot;</b> 
  said Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago. <b>As a 
  result of all this, physics literature has become peppered with suggestions 
  of ways to change gravity</b>. This fall, given a choice of explanations for 
  dark energy during cosmology workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
  Physics in Santa Barbara, Calif., 20 of the 44 participants voted for some variation 
  of &quot;Einstein was wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Some of these proposals take their cue from the science-fiction-sounding string 
  theory, the putative theory of everything, which holds out the possibility that 
  our universe might be a 4-dimensional membrane (or &quot;brane&quot;) in an 
  11-dimensional space. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Allowing for 
  the 11th hidden sefira named Daat)?</font> Most of the vibrating strings that 
  make up the particles and forces of nature in string theory would be stuck to 
  the brane, like the nap on a rug. But the strings responsible for transmitting 
  gravity would be able to drift away or &quot;leak&quot; into the meta-space 
  surrounding the brane as they traveled along it from distant objects, according 
  to a theory set forth in 2000 by Dr. Gia Dvali, Dr. Gregory Gabadadze and Dr. 
  Massimo Porrati of New York University. The effect, they say, would be to make 
  distant galaxies appear as if they were accelerating as they moved away from 
  us.</p>

    shrine of the people of Israel. On the summit lies a big Rock, the Foundation 
    Stone, because the world (the entire Universe) was founded on it. For Isaiah 
    the prophet said: &quot;Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I lay in Zion for 
    a foundation, a Stone...a costly corner stone of sure foundation.&quot; </font>From 
    the Legends of Jerusalem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also in a stringy vein is Cardassian expansion, named after the villainous 
  race on &quot;Star Trek,&quot; and dreamed up by Dr. Katherine Freese and Dr. 
  Matthew Lewis of the University of Michigan. According to their theory, the 
  universe accelerates as a result of other branes tugging on our own. &quot;One 
  can get an accelerating universe without having any dark energy,&quot; Dr. Freese 
  said.</p>
<p>Other theorists are going back and modifying general relativity directly, noting 
  that when he wrote it down Einstein chose the simplest possible equations that 
  would carry out his ideas. But more complicated equations might be necessary. 
  That was the approach taken by Dr. Turner and his colleagues, Dr. Sean Carroll 
  and Dr. Vikram Duvvuri of Chicago, and Dr. Mark Trodden of Syracuse. The result 
  was a universe that would speed up as it got bigger and emptier. That might 
  sound crazy, Dr. Turner said, but not any crazier than the idea 80 years ago 
  that the universe would be expanding.</p>
<p>The model raises as many questions as it answers, but it and others like it 
  are still worth pursuing, Dr. Carroll said. <b>&quot;Something funny is going 
  on when the universe gets to be 10 billion years old,&quot; he said, &quot;and 
  none of our current ideas is standing up and declaring itself to be the right 
  answer, so we have to be bold.&quot;</b></p>

    September 2, 2003</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Einstein once wondered aloud whether 
    &quot;God had any choice&quot; in creating the universe. IT WAS HIS FONDEST 
    HOPE THAT THE ANSWER WAS NO. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
    and subsequent generations of physicists have hoped that at the end of their 
    labors there would be one answer &#151; a so-called Theory of Everything &#151; 
    that would explain why the details of the world are the way they are and cannot 
    be any other way: why there was a Big Bang, the number of dimensions of space-time, 
    the masses of elementary particles.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 20 years, physicists have lodged 
    those hopes in string theory, a mathematically labyrinthian effort to portray 
    nature as made up of tiny wriggling strings and membranes, rather than pointlike 
    particles or waves. Once called a piece of 21st-century physics that had fallen 
    into the 20th century by accident, string theory has become one of the hippest 
    fields of science, celebrated in books like the recent best seller &quot;The 
    Elegant Universe,&quot; by the Columbia theorist Brian Greene, and the subject 
    of a miniseries on &quot;Nova,&quot; coming this fall.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In principle, strings can unite 
    all the forces of nature, including gravity, in a single mathematical framework. 
    But the &quot;stringiness&quot; of nature manifests itself only at energies 
    and temperatures that can be generated in a particle accelerator the size 
    of a small galaxy. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result, 
    physicists have been left at the mercy of their mathematical imaginations 
    or sifting cosmological data for hints of a clue from God's own particle accelerator, 
    the Big Bang.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hope was that when all was 
    said and done, there would be only one solution to the theory's tangled equations, 
    one answer corresponding to only one possible universe. But recent progress 
    in string theory paradoxically seems to leave physics further than ever from 
    that dream of a unique answer. Instead of a single answer, the equations of 
    string theory seem to have so many solutions, MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF THEM, 
    each describing a logically possible universe, that it may be impossible to 
    tell which one describes our own. </font>(Hmmm, let's see now, how many individual 
    souls are there in the universe)?</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a series of conceptual and technical

    theory could describe a universe whose expansion was accelerating &#151; something 
    that many experts thought impossible. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
    was no small accomplishment because cosmologists now theorize that some puzzling 
    AND SO FAR UNIDENTIFIED &quot;DARK ENERGY&quot; is wrenching space apart ever 
    more violently. THIS ENERGY SEEMS TO MAKE UP ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE COSMOS, 
    according to astronomical observations.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new calculations suggest that 
    this dark energy cannot last forever, that it will disappear sometime in the 
    far future, according to the researchers, Dr. Shamit Kachru, Dr. Renata Kallosh 
    and Dr. Andrei Linde, all of Stanford, and Dr. Sandip P. Trivedi of the Tata 
    Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay. But the same calculations confirmed 
    that string theory could have a vast number of solutions, each representing 
    a different universe with slightly different laws of physics. The detailed 
    characteristics of any particular one of these universes &#151; the laws that 
    describe the basic forces and particles &#151; might be decided BY CHANCE.

    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result, string theorists and 
    cosmologists are confronted with what Dr. Leonard Susskind of Stanford has 
    called &quot;THE COSMIC LANDSCAPE,&quot; A SORT OF METAREALM OF SPACE-TIMES. 
    Contrary to Einstein's hopes, IT MAY BE THAT NEITHER GOD NOR PHYSICS CHOOSES 
    among these possibilities, Dr. Susskind contends. RATHER IT COULD BE LIFE.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only a fraction of the universes 
    in this metarealm would have THE LUCKY BLEND of properties suitable for life,

    one of these. &quot;We live where we can live,&quot; he said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Susskind conceded that many 
    colleagues who harbor the Einsteinian dream of predicting everything are appalled 
    by that notion that God plays dice with the laws of physics. Among them is 
    Dr. David Gross, director of the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics in 
    Santa Barbara, Calif., who said, &quot;I'm a total Einsteinian with respect 
    to the ultimate goal of science.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Physicists 
    should be able to predict all the parameters of nature, Dr. Gross said, adding, 
    &quot;They're not adjustable.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
    Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said, &quot;I 
    think this grand dream is basically dying.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Michael Douglas of Rutgers

    can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant,&quot; he said. &quot;Is this

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Early Hopes: Not Particles, 
    but Strings </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The question of whether strings 
    will provide a unique answer to the universe has been hanging over physicists' 
    heads ever since the modern form of string theory made its triumphal emergence 
    in 1984. That year, Dr. John Schwarz of the California Institute of Technology 
    and Dr. Michael Green, now of Cambridge University in England, showed that 
    thinking of elementary particles as little strings instead of points eliminated 
    troublesome mathematical anomalies from theories that sought to combine gravity 
    with subatomic physics.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even Einstein had failed to unite 
    those disparate and mathematically incompatible realms. But the 1984 calculation 
    raised the hope that physicists had finally found the key to the so-called 
    Theory of Everything. &quot;There was this wild enthusiasm, unbridled enthusiasm, 
    that we paid for later,&quot; said Dr. Andrew Strominger, a professor of physics 
    at Harvard.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1985, Dr. Strominger, Dr. Edward 
    Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Dr. Gary T. Horowitz, 
    now at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Dr. Philip Candelas, 
    now at the University of Texas, published a classic paper showing that it 
    was possible to construct a string theory consistent with the so-called Standard 
    Model that describes particles and forces in our four-dimensional universe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ONE PROBLEM IS THAT STRING THEORY 
    REQUIRES TEN DIMENSIONSOF SPACE-TIME, WHEREAS WE LIVE IN FOUR. Dr. Strominger 
    remembered being excited when he found a paper by the mathematician Dr. Shing-Tung 
    Yau, now of Harvard and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It proved a conjecture 
    by Dr. Eugenio Calabi, now retired from the University of Pennsylvania, that 
    the extra dimensions could be curled up in microscopically invisible ways 
    like the loops in a carpet.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paper described only one way 
    this folding could be done. But Dr. Yau soon told the physicists that there 
    were thousands of what are now called Calabi-Yau spaces, each one representing 
    a different solution of the string equations. By the time their paper was 
    finished, &quot;the uniqueness of string theory was certainly already in question,&quot; 
    Dr. Strominger said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That was just the beginning. For 
    each of the thousands of ways of curling the extra dimensions into Calabi-Yau 
    spaces, there were hundreds of variations in details like the sizes of the 
    loops and the way electrical and magnetic fields thread through them. When 
    the variations are taken into account, the number of solutions and the number 
    of possible universes can easily exceed 10100.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Challenge: A Universe Unfit 
    for Life or Physics? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This bounty of possibilities makes 
    it extremely daunting for scientists who want to test string theory by comparing 
    its predictions to the real world. One telltale clue to the right answer, 
    as well as a huge challenge, developed five years ago when astronomers discovered 
    that the expansion of the universe was apparently accelerating. But until 
    recently, many theorists doubted that strings could produce even one example 
    of an accelerating universe. The reason is that the leading explanation for 
    this behavior is a cosmic repulsion, known as THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT, that 
    results from the properties of empty space itself. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was first invented by Einstein in 1917 as a fudge factor to stabilize the 
    universe and then abandoned by him when astronomers found out that THE UNIVERSE 
    WAS NOT STATIC, BUT EXPANDING </font>(as Human Consciousness itself)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Einstein's fudge factor is real 
    after all, the universe will continue to expand faster and faster AS SPACE 
    GROWS BIGGER AND BIGGER, producing more and more repulsion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">String theorists did not know how 
    to deal with the cosmological constant. According to quantum mechanics, the 
    weird laws that govern subatomic physics, EMPTY SPACE SHOULD BE FOAMING WITH 
    ENERGY AND PARTICLES THAT WINK IN AND OUT OF EXISTENCE, and their collective 
    effect could produce a repulsive force like Einstein's constant. But the calculations 
    also suggest that this force should be some 1060 times what astronomers have 
    measured; (and) it would have blown the universe apart in its first millisecond, 
    long before atoms, galaxies or humans could form. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, a permanently accelerating 
    universe would present DEEP CONCEPTUAL PROBLEMS, several physicists pointed 
    out, including Dr. Thomas Banks of Rutgers and the University of California 
    at Santa Cruz, Dr. Willy Fischler of the University of Texas, Dr. Susskind 
    and Dr. Witten. Such a universe WOULD SLOWLY EMPTY ITSELF OF ENERGY AND INFORMATION 
    because most of the galaxies would eventually be flying away so fast that 
    humans could not see them. The observable universe would actually shrink, 
    as if surrounded by a black hole. Life would become impossible, and the usual 
    methods of formulating physics might not apply.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result of such arguments, 
    it was widely presumed that a universe that accelerated forever &#151; that 
    is, one with a cosmological constant &#151; was incompatible with string theory, 
    Dr. Kachru of Stanford said. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
    was partly to counter such claims, he added, that he and his colleagues were 
    motivated to look for the cosmological constant in the gazillions of possible 
    string universes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Hitch A Breakthrough, but a 
    Bleak One </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last winter, Dr. Kachru and his 
    colleagues succeeded in using string theory to construct universes that accelerated, 
    but with a surprising twist. The hitch, in each case, was that the acceleration 
    would be only temporary. It might last an extremely long time, but eventually 
    the dark energy of the cosmological constant would melt away, decaying just 
    in time to avoid the problems of permanent acceleration that string theorists 
    have worried about. The universe would then coast for the rest of eternity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The work followed on previous work 
    by Dr. Kachru with Dr. Joseph Polchinski of the Santa Barbara Institute and 
    Dr. Steven Giddings of the University of California at Santa Barbara, and 
    by Dr. Polchinski and Dr. Raphael Bousso of the University of California at 
    Berkeley. Part of the reason dark energy decays, explained Dr. Linde of Stanford, 
    is that these solutions describe the four-dimensional universe we observe 
    around us &#151; three dimensions of space and one of time &#151; WITH THE 
    OTHER SIX CURLED UP SO TIGHTLY that they cannot provide closet space. But 
    it takes energy to keep the extra dimensions confined. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;IN 
    THE LONG RUN,&quot; HE SAID, THE UNIVERSE DOESN'T WANT TO BE FOUR-DIMENSIONAL. 
    IT WANTS TO BE TEN-DIMENSIONAL.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So sooner or later, the loops will 
    unravel like a tangle of rubber bands, passing through a succession of configurations 
    that take less and less energy to maintain, until finally the other dimensions 
    expand and the cosmological constant is gone. THE DECAY OF THE COSMOLOGICAL 
    CONSTANT WILL BE FATAL, ASTRONOMERS AGREE. At that moment a bubble of 10-dimensional 
    space will sweep out at the speed of light, rearranging physics and the prospects 
    of atoms and planets, not to mention biological creatures. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What 
    it leaves behind,&quot; Dr. Susskind said, &quot;it's hard to say. Almost 
    certainly not a livable universe.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Role of Luck: A Controversial 
    Idea Returns to Stage </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The universe is certainly livable 
    now, but why has long been a vexing and polarizing issue. Life as We Know 
    It SEEMS TO REQUIRE AN ALMOST MIRACULOUS JUGGLING OF A FEW ATOMIC AND ASTRONOMICAL 
    PARAMETERS. WAS THE UNIVERSE DESIGNED FOR US? OR DID WE JUST GET LUCKY? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Searching for answers, some theorists 
    have invoked THE SO-CALLED ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE, which states that our universe 
    has to have laws suitable for life. Otherwise we would not be here to see 
    it. The apparent &quot;fine-tuning&quot; of this universe is simply an artifact 
    of our own existence here as observers, Dr. Brandon Carter, now at the Paris 
    Observatory in Meudon, argued in 1974. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    principle fits well with recent theories of the Big Bang that suggest that 
    the universe seen through telescopes is just one in an endless chain of bubble 
    universes that sprout from one another.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If there is just one universe, 
    the fact that it suits us would seem suspiciously lucky. BUT IF THERE ARE 
    MANY UNIVERSES TO CHOOSE FROM, OUR EXISTENCE IS LESS MIRACULOUS. It might 
    be the diversity of string-theory universes that gives this metacosmos a chance 
    at harboring life, Dr. Susskind says. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He likes to portray it as a mountain 
    range, the &quot;cosmic landscape,&quot; in which the height of the peaks 
    represents the energy or the cosmological constant of that configuration. 
    The universe is like water rolling around the hills, always seeking a lower 
    state. There are valleys and basins and plateaus where it can rest. But it 
    can spread, plopping like a wave sloshing over the hills from valley to valley, 
    from one configuration of dimensions and fields to another.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result, he said, in whatever 
    form it starts, the universe will branch out into other forms. If it keeps 
    sloshing, it will eventually land in a valley with the lucky mix of cosmic 
    constants that allows for galaxies and carbon-based chemistry somewhere. If 
    a small fraction of the subuniverses can support life, then there is a good 
    chance that life will arise somewhere, Dr. Susskind explained. Others caution, 
    however, that IT HAS NOT BEEN PROVED THAT DIFFERENT CLASSES OF UNIVERSES WOULD 
    BE SO CONNECTED. &quot;It could be that there are many disconnected landscapes,&quot; 
    explained Dr. Douglas of Rutgers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Susskind said that &quot;whether 
    we like it or not,&quot; the new findings gave further credence to the anthropic 
    principle and a mathematical framework for how it might work. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
    such &quot;anthropic thinking&quot; is defeatist to many physicists. &quot;We 
    see this kind of thing happen over and over again as a reaction to difficult 
    problems,&quot; Dr. Gross said. &quot;Come up with a grand principle that 
    explains why you're unable to solve the problem.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    notion that some problems are unsolvable is discouraging to the younger generation, 
    he said, pointing out that nobody even knows what the final form of string 
    theory will be.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Witten said he also disliked 
    the anthropic principle. &quot;I continue to hope that we are overlooking 
    or misunderstanding something and that THERE IS ULTIMATELY A MORE UNIQUE ANSWER,&quot; 
    he wrote by e-mail. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Susskind conceded that he had 
    once been on the other side of the question. &quot;I've had myself jerked 
    around by this theory,&quot; he said. &quot;When you have to give up your 
    fondest dream for what the theory would do&quot; &#151; a reference to the 
    quest for a unique answer &#151; &quot;that's a hard thing to swallow.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Future: Still Listening for 
    Orderly Music </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Strominger of Harvard said 
    the debate on anthropic principle was indicative of the &quot;all-or-nothing 
    psychology&quot; of string theory. &quot;It's not enough to solve some problems,&quot; 
    he said. &quot;It has to solve every problem.&quot; Theorists have long hoped 
    that all but one of these solutions will eliminate themselves through some 
    mathematical inconsistency or failure to reproduce an essential feature of 
    the universe like the cosmological constant. Dr. Douglas of Rutgers has challenged 
    that hope, saying string theory may have so many solutions that physical measurements 
    can not distinguish among them. Indeed, he pointed out in a recent paper, 
    it has not been proved that string theory does not have an infinite number 
    of solutions. So far, anything seems possible.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rather than sifting myriad solutions 
    for the one that fits our universe, Dr. Douglas has developed statistical 
    methods to analyze the set of string solutions as a whole TO FIND PATTERNS 
    that will not show up when the solutions are examined one by one. The results 
    could help ascertain which features of this &quot;zoo of possibilities&quot; 
    are more common and which are more rare, and how many solutions really are 
    too many.</font></p>
