    <b>QUIET NEGOTIATIONS DEVELOP POSSIBLE MIDEAST PEACE PLAN</b></p>
  <p align="center">By Jimmy Carter</p>
  <p align="left">Although it has received little attention in the U.S. media, 
    a detailed, soon-to-be-released Middle East accord struck by a group of influential 
    Israelis and Palestinians paves the way to the region's best, and perhaps 
    last, chance for peace. Its plan is an alternative to the &quot;Quartet&quot; 
    road map fashioned by the U.S., the European Union, the United Nations and 
    Russia. That also offered an encouraging prospect for peace, but even its 
    first basic phase has been substantially rejected. Key obstacles have been 
    Israel's insistence on colonizing Gaza and the far reaches of the West Bank, 
    and the Palestinians' insistence on the withdrawal of all Israeli settlements, 
    a return to the pre-1967 border and a right to unlimited return for refugees 
    from the 1948 and 1967 wars.</p>
  <p align="left"> The Quartet's plan is now a dead issue. Instead, there are 
    continuing violent attacks by Palestinian terrorist groups and increasingly 
    harsh reprisals from Israel. With apparent acquiescence from the Bush administration, 
    Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon recently announced that additional settlement 
    units will be built and the Israeli dividing wall farther intruded into Palestinian 
    land. Supporting such policies is the worst thing America could do for Israelis 
    who want peace. There also is no doubt that the obvious lack of real effort 
    to resolve the Palestinian issue is a primary source of anti-American sentiment 
    throughout the Middle East and a major incentive for terrorist activity.</p>
  <p align="left">Determined negotiators...For more than two years, the group 
    of Israelis and Palestinians, many of whom played key roles at earlier discussions 
    under President Clinton at Camp David and later at Taba, Egypt, has held difficult, 
    tedious negotiations. Working without government support, both sides have 
    made constructive concessions without contradicting the concepts of the Oslo 
    accords of 1993, the Clinton proposals and the Quartet road map. Their work 
    is not a substitute for official government action. It does, however, present 
    a clear picture of a final, comprehensive peace agreement that could bring 
    the terrible Middle East conflict to a peaceful conclusion. The final result 
    of this heroic effort soon will be revealed in Geneva.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Their plan proposes a two-state solution. It would settle the 
    conflict's most critical elements, including precise border delineations, 
    Israeli settlements, the end of excessive occupation of Palestinian lands, 
    the future of Jerusalem and its holy places and the extremely troubling question 
    of Palestinian refugees. The proposed plan permits more than half of Israeli 
    settlers to remain permanently in the West Bank, strictly limits the return 
    of Palestinian refugees and provides for a contiguous Palestinian state in 
    the West Bank, connected to Gaza by a secure highway. Highly-developed Palestinian 
    land near Jerusalem now occupied by Israeli settlers would be swapped for 
    equal areas of remote, uninhabited Israeli land. Satellite imagery has defined 
    a border to the level of individual homes. Unrestricted access by specific 
    routes is guaranteed to East Jerusalem's holy places.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Not yet resolved, but ...There inevitably will be modifications 
    to this breakthrough proposal. With full backing from Washington, follow-up 
    negotiations could finally reach the goal of a comprehensive peace between 
    Israel and its neighbors. Presumably &#151; and as already pledged by Crown 
    Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia &#151; such an agreement would induce all 
    Arab nations to recognize Israel's rights to live in peace and to take action 
    to prevent further violence initiated by naysaying Palestinian groups. Such 
    a commitment should be a prerequisite to a final agreement.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Current U.S.-Israeli strategies must change. Demanding an end 
    to all terrorism before final negotiations only guarantees they never happen. 
    Such extremist groups as Hamas do not want a negotiated settlement and are 
    out of the Palestinian Authority's control. Half-hearted, step-by-step approaches 
    let violent acts on either side subvert the peace process. REAL MOVES TOWARD 
    PEACE DEMAND BOLD ACTION BY LEADERS. THIS INITIATIVE CAN PROVIDE INDISPENSIBLE 
    GUIDANCE. IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL EVER SEE A MORE PROMISING FOUNDATION FOR 
    PEACE.</p>

  <p align="left">Former United States President Jimmy Carter is to be present 
    at the formal signing in Geneva next month of an unofficial peace plan for 
    the Middle East. The Bush administration has chosen to remain on the sidelines, 
    while the Israeli government says it is unhappy with Switzerland&#146;s role 
    in the affair. Professor Alexis Keller, a Geneva-based academic and architect 
    of the 60-page document, announced Carter&#146;s support for the plan on Monday.</p>
</div>
<p align="left">The &#147;Geneva Accord&#148; covers many divisive issues between 
  Israelis and Palestinians: Jerusalem, a Palestinian state, the right of return 
  for Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements. It was signed in Jordan on 
  October 12 by a former Israeli cabinet minister, Yossi Beilin and his Palestinian 
  counterpart, Yasser Abed Rabbo, following two years of secret negotiations. 
  The Swiss government has provided financial support and logistical help.</p>
<p align="left">Nobel prizewinner The Swiss authorities have warmly welcomed Carter&#146;s 
  presence in Geneva on November 20. The former US president received the Nobel 
  Peace Prize for successfully brokering one of the few breakthroughs the Middle 
  East conflict. In 1978 he persuaded Israel&#146;s Menahem Begin and Egypt&#146;s 
  Anwar Sadat to sign the Camp David Accords.</p>
<p align="left">&#147;This is a very positive and encouraging sign,&#148; said 
  Alex Biscaro, a spokesman for the Swiss embassy in Washington. &#147;A personality 
  like Jimmy Carter has a certain aura because the former American president is 
  seen as a symbol of hope &#150; proof, especially for people in the Middle East, 
  that it is possible to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&#148;</p>
<p align="left">Israel displeased:</p>
<p align="left">The embassy has denied that the signing of the accord &#150; originally 
  scheduled for November 4 &#150; had been put back because of Israel&#146;s &#147;displeasure&#148; 
  at Switzerland&#146;s actions. Israel has made it clear that it is interested 
  only in the US-backed &#147;road map&#148; for peace, viewing the Swiss-backed 
  initiative as counterproductive. &#147;The reasons for this postponement are 
  purely logistical,&#148; Biscaro told swissinfo. &#147;Many people are involved 
  and it has been difficult trying to find a date that suits everybody.&#148; 
  Former US President Bill Clinton, who helped engineer the failed Oslo accords, 
  has also been invited to attend the Geneva ceremony.</p>
<p align="left">Dressing-down:</p>
<p align="left">On Monday the Israeli government summoned Claude Altermatt, the 
  Swiss ambassador to Israel, telling him it had &#147;serious reservations&#148; 
  about Switzerland&#146;s role. Israel is also unhappy that the Swiss foreign 
  minister, Micheline Calmy-Rey, presented the peace plan to United Nations Secretary-General 
  Kofi Annan in New York at the weekend. The document was also discussed with 
  the US deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, David Satterfield. 
  Urs Ziswiler, an aide to Calmy-Rey, said Satterfield had taken note of the accord 
  but &#147;cannot and does not want to take a position on it&#148;. </p>
<p align="left">&#147;But, for us, it is very important that the United States 
  is not opposed to it,&#148; he added. This was echoed by Biscaro at the Washington 
  embassy, who said that without Washington&#146;s support any hope of resolving 
  the conflict was dead in the water. &#147;It is important in the short term 
  to establish an impetus [for peace], with the support of civil society in the 
  region, which could eventually attract the support of the international community,&#148; 
  he said.</p>

  US TO SUPPORT DISSIDENT PLAN FOR PEACE DEAL IN MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p align="center">ROSS DUNN IN JERUSALEM </p>
<p>Sun 30 Nov 2003</p>
<p> DISSIDENT Israeli and Palestinian politicians will tomorrow sign a peace treaty 
  in Geneva in a symbolic ceremony designed to put pressure on the leaders of 
  both sides. And, in a sign that the &#145;treaty&#146; could become more than 
  just an empty gesture, it has attracted support from the US. American Secretary 
  of State Colin Powell is to hold talks with the negotiators of the Geneva accords, 
  which are backed by the Swiss government, after the official launch. </p>
<p>Among the dignitaries who have confirmed they will attend the event is former 
  US president Jimmy Carter, who said a peace deal in the Middle East could reduce 
  the threat of terrorism. &quot;If a solution is finally found, establishing 
  a Palestinian state and assuring a peaceful existence for the Israelis as well 
  as the Palestinians, that would reduce tension in the whole region and the terrorist 
  menace at the same time,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>Prominent Israeli commentator Akiva Eldar, who writes for the Ha&#146;aretz 
  newspaper, said the accords had already served a purpose by relaying a message 
  of hope after years of despair. &quot;It is sending a message to the Israeli 
  public, to the Palestinians, to the international community that there are Israeli 
  and Palestinian partners for peace, that peace is possible,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>Under the hugely controversial plan, the Palestinians would gain an independent 
  state with Jerusalem as its capital, thereby gaining control of the city&#146;s 
  key holy sites. This includes the Temple Mount, the area where Jewish temples 
  stood in biblical times and which is regarded as the most sacred area in Judaism. 
  For centuries, it has been home to the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, 
  making it the third-holiest place in Islam after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>The Israeli negotiators say that the Palestinians would have to pay a price 
  for gaining sovereignty over this area. Although it is not explicitly stated 
  as such in the document, the Palestinians would effectively have to agree to 
  give up the right of return for millions of refugees to areas that are now part 
  of Israel. </p>
<p>The Israeli government denounced the initiative, saying that the Israelis involved 
  had no mandate to negotiate on behalf of the Jewish state. Israeli Prime Minister 
  Ariel Sharon said the accords were harmful to his nation: &quot;Only a government 
  can conduct negotiations for a political solution and sign an agreement.&quot; 
</p>
<p>But despite such opposition, the proposals are starting to gain support among 
  senior figures including Powell. Powell welcomed the Geneva initiative, which 
  is being led by former Israeli cabinet minister Yossi Beilin and former Palestinian 
  cabinet minister Yasser Abed Rabbo, as &quot;important and potentially useful&quot;. 
  Powell&#146;s support is seen by observers as a veiled warning that the US is 
  not happy with the lack of progress to peace. </p>

  INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER</p>
<p>INTERVIEWER: The Middle East first of all, Mr. Carter. What led you to propose 
  reconvening the Geneva talks?</p>
<p>PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER: Well, I had an interest in the Middle East from the 
  time I was much younger, and then when I was Governor I went to the Middle East 
  to travel around - that was in 1972. During my campaign for president, I made 
  it clear to the American people, and I guess to the warriors who would listen, 
  that when I became the leader of this country, that I would initiate the strongest 
  possible move to bring peace to the Middle East. As you know, nothing was being 
  done then on the peace front. UN Resolution 242 had been passed, but nothing 
  had happened. So, very early in my term, beginning in January, I began to invite 
  the various leaders to come to Washington and to meet with me: President Rabin, 
  who was Prime Minister of Israel at that time; King Hussein came over; President 
  Sadat came over; later Menachim Begin came over, after he was elected in May, 
  I think. Assad has never yet been to the United States, so I met him in Geneva. 
  During a G7 meeting in London, I went over to Geneva to meet with Assad. So 
  by the time the end of the first five months had passed of my term, I had met 
  with all the key leaders in the Middle East. And I felt, after talking to Sadat 
  in particular, that that was a time to re-initiate a strong move, led by me, 
  for a peace effort. Then it seemed that I should do it completely within the 
  framework of the UN resolutions, Security Council resolutions, and that was 
  my hope. In response to my conversations with him, Sadat first decided that 
  he would invite all the participants to come to Cairo, including all the five 
  nations, the prominent members of the Security Council. I was very averse to 
  bring in France and China, as well as Great Britain and the United States, so 
  I objected to that, and suggested that he have another alternative in mind; 
  and that's when he decided to go directly to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>INT: In an important speech that you made early that year, you talked about 
  the necessity to introduce fairness into a settlement in the Middle East. What 
  did you mean by that?</p>
<p>JC: Well, this speech got me into a lot of trouble because I talked about a 
  homeland for the Palestinians. Prior to that time, and maybe since then as well, 
  the United States Government policy has been overwhelmingly oriented toward 
  compatibility with the government in Jerusalem, in Israel, and I felt that we 
  couldn't really make progress in bringing about a comprehensive peace between 
  Israel and her Arab neighbors without at least addressing the concerns of the 
  Palestinians, of Egypt and of Jordan in particular. So in that speech that I 
  made, I think in Massachusetts, I thought that it was proper to say that the 
  Palestinians deserved a homeland of their own, and this aroused a furore in 
  some circles in my country; but it was a necessary prerequisite for the further 
  progress that was made between Israel and Egypt.</p>
<p>INT: After Sadat's visit to Jerusalem and speech to the Knesset, and after 
  a great deal more hard work, you managed to get the major participants to come 
  to Camp David to sit down with you. How difficult were those 13 days?</p>
<p>JC: I think, as everyone will probably remember, when Sadat went to Jerusalem 
  it was a momentous event. He made a very harsh speech to the Israeli Knesset, 
  but the fact that he went there and made a speech did away with the sharp edges 
  of what he actually said. Later, when he and Begin had a meeting in Ismailya, 
  they were totally incompatible; they were only together 15 minutes or so, and 
  then they separated in some degree of anger. I had my hopes up when Sadat went 
  to Jerusalem, and my hopes in effect were dashed when the results were so poor. 
  So it was that failure of real progress after Sadat's historic trip that caused 
  me to invite Begin and Sadat to come to Camp David, which I did with a long 
  handwritten personal letter to each one, and they both accepted. I didn't know 
  what was going to happen at Camp David - no one knew - and I think the general 
  presumption was that not much would happen. And at the time, we envisioned maybe 
  three days of exploratory talks. When I arrived at Camp David, Sadat followed 
  me first, and Sadat was willing to comply with my hope that we might elevate 
  our expectations dramatically and actually have an agreement between Israel 
  and Egypt. When Begin came, though, he wanted us just to do some preparations 
  for future talks that would go into any kind of details with the foreign ministers 
  and defense ministers at some neutral place in the Middle East. And so it was 
  out of that environment that we began our negotiations. The first three days 
  of the talks were very unpleasant; primarily, I and Begin and Sadat in a very 
  small room. Sometimes the Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, was there. I would 
  try to get the two men to agree on something, and they couldn't agree on anything; 
  they were very antagonistic. No matter what my efforts were, they always wanted 
  to revert back to what had happened in the last 25 years, with four wars and 
  boys killed and bombs dropped. So, for the last 10 days in Camp David, they 
  never saw each other. I kept them totally apart, and I went back and forth between 
  the Egyptians and the Israelis to try to conclude an agreement. I used then, 
  and still use, a technique that I call &quot;the single document technique&quot;, 
  in that I have exactly the same text that I present to the Israelis and the 
  Egyptians, and every time one of them insists on a change, I make that change 
  and present it to the other, so there's no reason for them to believe that I'm 
  misleading them. And so it was that long, tedious, back-and-forth negotiation 
  that finally brought the two men to an agreement.</p>
<p>INT: You didn't get much sleep?</p>
<p>JC: No, I didn't get much sleep, but there was an element of excitement and... 
  you know, there that kept us going.</p>
<p>INT: But how near did the talks come to complete breakdown at the end?</p>
<p>JC: Almost completely, on two occasions. One was when Sadat met with Moshe 
  Dayan, whom he had hardly known. Moshe Dayan was Foreign Minister then. He had 
  known Isa Weizmann quite well, and liked Weizmann. But he had a talk with Dayan, 
  and Dayan in effect, without my knowing it, told Sadat &quot;The Israelis will 
  go no further; there will be no more concessions on the part of the Israelis.&quot; 
  I didn't know it, but Sadat told the Egyptian delegation, &quot;We are leaving 
  Camp David,&quot; and he went to my national security adviser, Zbigniew Brezinski 
  and said, &quot;Bring my helicopter - I'm going back to Egypt.&quot; I learned 
  about this, and I went over to Sadat's cabin and I confronted him in a very 
  frank and ultimately successful way. I said that &quot;Our friendship is over. 
  You promised me that you would stay at Camp David as long as I was willing to 
  negotiate, and here you have made your plans to leave without even consulting 
  me, and I consider this a serious blow to our personal friendship and to the 
  relationship between Egypt and the United States.&quot; And he agreed to stay, 
  to the consternation of the other Egyptians. That was one time it almost broke 
  down. And the other time was at the end of the talks, when Begin had made an 
  oath before God that he would never dismantle an Israeli settlement, and there 
  was a substantial settlement on Egyptian territory, called Yamit; about 3,000 
  Israelis were there. Begin could not bring himself to violate his promise to 
  God. So at the last minute, we evolved an alternative: that Begin would stand 
  aside and let the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, decide to dismantle or not 
  dismantle the settlement. And after that, we signed the Camp David accords, 
  and then later the Knesset voted 85% to dismantle the settlement at Yamit. To 
  my disappointment, they not only withdrew the Israeli settlers but they also 
  bulldozed everything level with the ground.</p>
<p>INT: Those accords - one of your greatest achievements?</p>
<p>JC: I would say one of the achievements. I don't know whether they have the 
  longest-lasting impact. Some of the domestic legislation - we deregulatedalmost 
  everything in the Government, and we had the (unclear) Bill, and I normalized 
  relatiowith the People's Republic of China, and had the Panama Canal treaties. 
  But certainly that was one of the highlights of my administration, yes.</p>
<p>INT: I'd like to turn to human rights, for which you'll very certainly always 
  be remembered, for your belief in that. You said very early on that human rights 
  would be a fundamental tenet of your foreign policy. Why did you say that, and 
  what does that mean?</p>
<p>JC: I come out of the environment of the Deep South, where I had seen the millstone 
  of racial discrimination weighting down my people, both the black people and 
  the white people; and I had seen the enormous progress that we were able to 
  make after we removed the legal restraints of a two-class society, with the 
  whites superior and blacks inferior. So I was very convinced before I became 
  President that basic human rights, equality of opportunity, the end of abuse 
  by governments of their people, was a basic principle on which the United States 
  should be an acknowledged champion. So I made the statement even before I was 
  inaugurated, as has been said, that... I announced that human rights would be 
  a cornerstone or foundation of our entire foreign policy. So I officially designated 
  every US ambassador on earth to be my personal human rights representative, 
  and to have the embassy be a haven for people who suffered from abuse by their 
  own government. And every time a foreign leader met with me, they knew that 
  human rights in their country would be on the agenda. And... I think that this 
  was one of the seminal changes that was brought to US policy. And although, 
  in the first few weeks of his term, my successor Ronald Reagan disavowed this 
  policy and sent an emissary down to Argentina and to Chile and to Brazil, to 
  the military dictators, and said &quot;The human rights policy of Carter is 
  over,&quot; it was just a few months before he saw that the American people 
  supported this human rights policy and that it was good for his administration, 
  so after that he became a strong protector of human rights as well.</p>
<p>INT: But relationships between states are based partly - some would say largely 
  - on realpolitik. The Soviet Union regarded your constant addressing of the 
  issue of human rights in relation to them as a sort of provocation. Were you 
  prepared for that? Did that concern you? Did it help your foreign policy or 
  hinder it?</p>
<p>JC: That's hard to say. There's another word that may not be in the dictionary: 
  idealpolitik, real and ideal. I didn't single out the Soviet Union for my human 
  rights policy: I applied it in a much more difficult way to the regimes in South 
  America, most of which were military dictatorships and very abusive. But the 
  Soviet leaders did assume that my human rights policy was targeted against them, 
  to embarrass them. I don't have any regrets about having done so. There's no 
  doubt that this was a cause of disharmony between me and Brezhnev, between my 
  Secretary of State and Gromyko and so forth. But it resulted almost immediately 
  in a dramatic increase, for instance, in Jewish migration from the Soviet Union. 
  The first year I was in office, only about 800 people came out of the Soviet 
  Union, Jews. By the third year I was in office... second year, 1979, 51,000 
  came out of the Soviet Union. And every one of the human rights heroes - I'll 
  use the word - who have come out of the Soviet Union, have said it was a turning 
  point in their lives, and not only in the Soviet Union but also in places like 
  Czechoslovakia and Hungary and Poland [they] saw this human rights policy of 
  mine as being a great boost to the present democracy and freedom that they enjoy. 
  I don't want to exaggerate its effect, but I think it was a very sound policy, 
  and it's basically been followed since then, and I think there's a much more 
  intense awareness of human rights principles now than there would have been 
  otherwise.</p>
<p>INT: Historians today would say that the pressures that you helped engender 
  within those societies led to the crack-up, or helped to lead to the crack-up 
  of the communist system at the end of the Cold War. </p>
<p>JC: Well, there's no doubt about that, that the American human rights policy 
  greatly strengthened the democratic forces that were in their embryonic or infant 
  stage in many countries around the world, and I would say particularly within 
  the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>INT: Agreed. President Carter, I'd like to talk to you now about arms. When 
  you came to office, you immediately began to press for deep cuts in arms levels. 
  Why did you do that?</p>
<p>JC: I thought it was necessary. I issued directives, for instance, not only 
  considering nuclear weapons but also sophisticated so-called...</p>
<p> INT: I wonder if I could interrupt you and ask you to start that answer again 
  and say, &quot;To me it was very important that we should achieve a reduction...&quot;</p>
<p>JC: OK, that's good. You interrupt me whenever.</p>
<p>INT: Yeah.</p>
<p>JC: Well, one of the greatest concerns that I had when I became President was 
  the vast array of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the United States and the 
  Soviet Union and a few other countries, and also the great proliferation of 
  conventional weapons, non-nuclear weapons, particularly as a tremendous burden 
  on the economies of developing or very poor countries. So I did a few things: 
  I issued a directive, which is still in effect now, prohibiting the sale of 
  any sophisticated weaponry to any country in this hemisphere, and that involves 
  F-16s or F-15s or advanced aircraft. It's still in effect. The other thing I 
  did was to try to put forward to the Soviet Union a much more dramatic reduction 
  in the total quantity and effectiveness of the nuclear weapons in our arsenals, 
  and to bring about a comprehensive test ban to eliminate the explosion of any 
  nuclear devices, either underground or in the air. And as is well known, in 
  March of the first year I was in office, I sent my Secretary of State, Cy Vance, 
  to Moscow with what I thought was a very good proposal for dramatic cuts; but 
  as an alternative, just to continue an evolutionary step-by-step move from the 
  Vladivostok agreement that my predecessor Gerald Ford had negotiated. The response 
  in Moscow was not very favorable.</p>
<p>INT: I mean, coming so soon after Vladivostok, Brezhnev was obviously quite 
  worried by what you were proposing. </p>
<p>JC: Yes, he was. And in retrospect, I can see that President Brezhnev was quite 
  proud of the limited agreement that he had concluded in Vladivostok; and to 
  have a new American president come in and say, &quot;That is not good enough 
  - let's do much more, and do it quite rapidly,&quot; took him by surprise.</p>
<p>INT: When the Soviet Union introduced SS-20 missiles into the European theatre, 
  as it were, you saw that as a serious threat.</p>
<p>JC: Yes, this was a form... The SS-20 that the Soviets introduced into the 
  European theatre, was a new and unexpected and very formidable weapon. It had 
  large warheads, it had three warheads, and the weapons were mobile: they could 
  be moved up and down on railroad tracks, so that we never knew exactly where 
  they were; and they were designed primarily to hit nearby targets throughout 
  Europe, including Great Britain. And so the previous negotiated nuclear arms 
  agreement had not really referred directly to these kinds of fairly short-range 
  missiles - they were long enough. So I did look upon them as a great threat 
  to stability, and we had primarily addressed, earlier than that, the enormous 
  intercontinental missiles that had been on the table for discussion primarily 
  between President Nixon and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>INT: But did you find it easy to get your European allies - I'm thinking particularly 
  of Helmut Schmidt - to accept that Pershing missiles, for example, should be 
  introduced into the theatre in response to the SS-20s?</p>
<p>JC: Well, we didn't have much of an altercation between me and European leaders, 
  including Helmut Schmidt, concerning Pershing missiles, but we did have an altercation 
  concerning the neutron weapon. The neutron weapon was something about which 
  we had the technology. It was designed not to destroy buildings and tanks, but 
  destroy human beings by the penetrating force of the nuclear waste products 
  from the explosion. It was an anti-personnel weapon. Earlier, before I becamePresident, 
  a commitment had been made that the United States would proceed with the development 
  of this missile; but when we got down to the point of expending large sums of 
  money in developing the neutron weapon, it became obvious to me that no leader 
  in Europe was willing to agree to deploy these weapons on their territory. And 
  despite my efforts to get Helmut Schmidt and Jim Callaghan in Great Britain 
  to do so, they would never agree. I had serious qualms about this missile anyway, 
  since it was inherently anti-personnel and not anti-tank or anti-building, so 
  I cancelled the project, and there was some altercation between me and the German 
  chancellor about the way that I did this.</p>
<p>INT: What was achieved at THE VIENNA SUMMIT in 1979?</p>
<p>JC: Well, the Vienna summit was in 1980. You may want to ask a question, because 
  in '79 we went... Oh, you mean with Brezhnev?</p>
<p>INT: Yeah.</p>
<p>JC: OK, I'll give you another answer. I was thinking about the G7. OK. In 1979, 
  we had a very productive summit between me and Brezhnev to negotiate the terms 
  of the SALT II nuclear weapons agreement. He and I got along quite well. It 
  was a harmonious meeting. I assuaged his concerns about my recent normalizing 
  of diplomatic relations with China. That had been the cause of great consternation 
  in Moscow, because they could envision, in their somewhat paranoid state, that 
  the US and China were secretly ganging up against the Soviet Union. This was 
  not the case. I think I alleviated his concerns with my discussions with him. 
  In addition to that, we put reasonable limits on the size of our nuclear arsenals, 
  agreeing to dismantle or destroy certain weapons. And expecting a future negotiation 
  to go further than that, we also put a five-year limit on the effectiveness 
  on the SALT II treaty. As a matter of fact, history will show that it lasted 
  indefinitely, and President Reagan only announced that it would be terminated 
  at the end of seven years, so it lasted longer than it was supposed to do. I 
  was prepared... So one of the things that I might add quickly is that when a 
  president negotiates an agreement of this kind, it goes into effect because 
  the president has the ability to control the nuclear arsenal to some degree. 
  The Congress never did ratify this treaty, although I presented it to the Congress, 
  to the committee, Foreign Relations Committee, because that winter, just six 
  months later, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, and at that time it would 
  have been almost impossible to get the Congress and the American public to approve 
  anything that related to commonality with the Soviet Union after they invaded 
  Afghanistan.</p>
<p>INT: At the end of your term of office, having come into power hoping to reduce 
  arms expenditure, you had to increase it in various important ways. Did that 
  mean that in your view d&eacute;tente was over and confrontation was on again? 
  Why were you forced to change your grand strategy in that way?</p>
<p>JC: Well, I didn't really change my grand strategy when I reduced the constraints 
  on our own capability militarily, and so, over a period of my term in office, 
  each year we had some increase in defense expenditures. The problem was that 
  before I became President, in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, there had been 
  fairly dramatic, and I think excessive, reductions in the capability of our 
  military forces, and as a former military man myself - I was a professional 
  naval officer, a submarine officer - I thought it was better, on a step-by-step, 
  very carefully planned way, to increase the technical, or technological, capability 
  of our weapons systems. So I chose as my Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, 
  a distinguished physicist who had been considered for a Nobel Prize in physics, 
  the head of California Institute of Technology, one of the finest engineering 
  schools on earth. And it was Harold Brown's technical ability as Secretary of 
  Defense that let us develop all the advanced weapons that were later demonstrated 
  in the Gulf War, when President Bush was in office. So my... my thrust was to 
  make sure that the American military was lean, was as small as possible, but 
  had the highest capability of advanced technology. This included, for instance, 
  the highly publicized Stealth aircraft, which at that time was our best-kept 
  secret.</p>
<p>INT: So in fact, again, the policies that you inaugurated towards the end of 
  your term had a lasting influence on America's stance in the Cold War, until 
  the end of the war?</p>
<p>JC: Yes, there's no doubt about it. And the fact that we developed... and I 
  even announced, during my last year in office, that we had developed the technology 
  for the Stealth aircraft, which makes them totally impervious to any sort of 
  defense - there's no way to see them in the sky with radar - and so I don't 
  think there's any doubt about that. And then, after he came into office, as 
  you know, President Reagan even escalated the amount of money spent for defense, 
  I think excessively, because he went back and resurrected some of the weapons 
  systems, the big bombers that were already outdated and were just designed primarily 
  to create employment opportunities in California.</p>
<p>INT: If I could stay on arms, and go back to your message to Brezhnev in '77, 
  the letter you sent him in February, and the visit of Cy Vance to Moscow in 
  March. What was your reaction when Brezhnev... can you remember what you felt, 
  what you thought, what you did, when Brezhnev appeared so surprised and dismayed 
  and critical?</p>
<p>JC: Well, I was taken aback, and I think the ... Let me start over again. When 
  I sent the Secretary of State, Cy Vance, to Moscow in... early in 1977, and 
  the Soviet Union rejected our nuclear disarmament proposal so vehemently, I 
  was really surprised. And I have to say, I think accurately, that we gave Brezhnev 
  two alternatives. One was the step-by-step evolutionary reductions, based on 
  Vladivostok; and the other one was a much more dramatic and quick reduction 
  in the total arsenals that we took to him. But he had the option of taking either 
  one. As a matter of fact, they reacted very negatively to this proposal. And 
  when Foreign Minister Gromyko came out of the Kremlin and made his public statement, 
  he almost ignored the subject of nuclear weapons: he concentrated on a vituperative 
  attack concerning our human rights policy, and alleged - incorrectly - that 
  our human rights policy was designed to embarrass the Soviet Union and was a 
  confrontational effort on my part. So I would say that their rejection of our 
  more bold nuclear arms control proposal was more designed as an adverse reaction 
  to our human rights policy than it was to the substance of the military proposal.</p>
<p>INT: What was Brezhnev like?</p>
<p>JC: Well, I only met Brezhnev in June of 1979, in Vienna. He was ill. It was 
  his time to come to Washington, but he was constrained by his doctors not to 
  fly at any great altitude because of his ear problem, so he could only fly short 
  distances; so I agreed, very generously and easily to go to Vienna instead. 
  He had to be supported as he walked around.. by someone; he was obviously unbalanced 
  (Clears throat) in his walking - he had an inner-ear problem. But he was very 
  alert mentally, and he was very harmonious with me. We had long talks, privately, 
  just the two of us, with interpreters, about all kinds of issues - I mentioned 
  our normalized relations with China; we had a good talk about human rights policy. 
  He was proud of the number of Jews who were being permitted to leave the Soviet 
  Union. We had reached agreement on the SALT II treaty; we had laid plans for 
  future, more dramatic reductions, and so forth. And one of the surprising things 
  that Brezhnev said when we were in our talks, was - when I proposed that we 
  make these changes in nuclear weaponry, he said, &quot;God will never forgive 
  us if we don't succeed.&quot; And, you know, coming from the leader of an atheistic 
  communist country, this surprised everyone. I think the most surprised person 
  at the tawas Gromyko, who looked up at the sky like this and did his hands in 
  a peculiar way, as though this was a shocking thing for Brezhnev to say. But 
  I would repeat that Brezhnev and I were quite compatible. And I don't khow strong 
  he was at home. Chernenko was with him and the military leaders were with him 
  and Gromyko was with him. I felt that all of them were much more... I'd say 
  cautious or conservative than was Brezhnev. And it was only... that was June, 
  and in December, right after Christmas, was when they invaded Afghanistan, and 
  that's when the good progress that we were making was fairly well made impossible 
  for a while.</p>
<p>INT: Why did SALT II arouse such strong feeling in the United States, such 
  critical feeling in the United States?</p>
<p>JC: Well, as a matter of fact it didn't. When we first negotiated SALT II, 
  there was a general acceptance of the success that we had in Vienna; and over 
  a period of time - it always takes a few months - we got the documents in proper 
  shape, with the back-up legislation to present to the Congress for ratification. 
  It takes a two-thirds vote in the US Senate. But about the time they got ready 
  to vote on SALT II is when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and then this totally 
  wiped out any possibility for agreement between us and the Soviet Union. But 
  as I've said earlier, the terms of the SALT II treaty were enforceable by me 
  and Brezhnev independent of US Senate ratification, so the SALT II treaty was 
  completely honored throughout its life.</p>

<p align="center">OVER 150,000 ATTEND RALLY CALLING FOR GAZA WITHDRAWEL<br>
  <br>
  By Lili Galili, Mazal Mualem and Tsahar Rotem, Haaretz Correspondents and Haaretz 
  Service</p>
<p align="left"> Sun., May 16, 2004__More than 150,000 people attended a left 
  wing demonstration at Rabin Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening under the 
  banner 'get out of Gaza and start talking.&quot; Event organizers assessed that 
  some 250,000 were present, Army Radio reported.</p>
<p>The rally opened at 8 P.M. with a minute of silence to commemorate the 13 Israel 
  Defense Forces soldiers killed in the Gaza Strip over the past week. Amid frequent 
  outbreaks of applause and cheering, opposition leader Shimon Peres told the 
  crows that 80 percent of Israeli want peace and just one percent is trying to 
  block it. &quot;We will not allow them,&quot; Peres said. &quot;We must not 
  support a puppet government that follows the delusional ideas of the right.&quot;</p>
<p>Yahad Chairman Yossi Beilin said that for the past three years the peace camp 
  has been dormant that today it finally awoke. One Nation chairman Amir Peretz 
  called for a resumption of peace talks, saying that diplomatic and social affairs 
  could not be seperated. &quot;as a resident of Sderot [near the Gaza Strip] 
  we do not fear disengagement and we fear neither dialogue nor a peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>The event took place under heavy security with some 1300 police officers and 
  volunteer security guards patrolling, and the streets around the plaza were 
  closed from 4:30 P.M. A delegation of 50 Palestinians, supporters of the Geneva 
  Initiative, were also expected to attend the rally. The Real Religious Zionist 
  Movement, an organization of moderate observant Jewish youths said late on Saturday 
  that they would have participated in the demonstration had it not been held 
  during the Sabbath. Groups members said the organizers should been more sensitive 
  to the religious public, but in a statement they said they joined the call for 
  a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and an end to the occupation.</p>
<p>A Yesha Council of Settlements statement said on Saturday that the &quot;leftist 
  extremists&quot; who organized the rally were dancing on blood of the Gaza victims. 
  &quot;The heads of the left are responsible for the bloody Oslo Accords which 
  cost in over 1,200 Israeli lives and turned the Gaza Strip into the explosive 
  pit it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking at the rally were opposition leader Shimon Peres, Yahad Chairman Yossi 
  Beilin, One Nation Chairman Amir Peretz, Peace Now leader Tzaly Reshef and Yochi 
  Brandes, on behalf of the Geneva Initiative, and former Shin Bet head Ami Ayalon, 
  former head of the Shin Bet for the People's Voice. Former GOC Southern Comman 
  chief Yom Tov Samia was also set to speak at the demonstration. Singers Danny 
  Sanderson and Dana Berger performed at the rally, along with the band Nikmat 
  Hatraktor.</p>
<p>Ahead of the demonstration, the organizers rejected calls from politicians 
  on the right to postpone the rally in the wake of the recent events in the Gaza 
  Strip. Likud MK Ehud Yatom argued that the protest would demoralize soldiers 
  serving in the Gaza Strip, Army Radio reported Friday. MK Gila Finkelstein of 
  the National Religious Party said Friday that holding such a demonstration while 
  the bodies of IDF soldiers were still lying in Rafah dishonors the fallen and 
  their bereaved families. United Torah Party MK Meir Porush told Army Radio that 
  political discourse should be put aside at a time when the country is mourning 
  the death of its soldiers.</p>
<p>The rally was scheduled by a new forum, Mate Harov (Majority's Coalition), 
  after the Likud referendum rejected the prime minister's plan for a pullout 
  from the Gaza Strip. The forum includes left and center-left groups such as 
  Labor, Yahad, One Nation, Peace Now, the kibbutz movements, the Geneva Initiative 
  organization, youth movements and the Forum of Bereaved Parents.</p>
<p>Minister of Social Affairs Zevulun Orlev (NRP) asked Peres on Thursday to postpone 
  the rally, saying it was not appropriate to hold a political demonstration while 
  fallen soldiers were being buried. The organizers responded that national unity 
  was not an issue considered by the prime minister when he decided to leave the 
  decision on going ahead with his disengagement plan solely in the hands of Likud 
  members. Thousand attending a Tel Aviv rally on Saturday, calling for a withdrawal

      refugees represent the basis for resolving the refugee issue, and agree 
      that these rights are fulfilled according to Article 7 of this Agreement. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>3. Compensation </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(a) Refugees shall be entitled to compensation for their refugeehood and

      permanent place of residence. </p>
    <p>(b) The Parties recognize the right of states that have hosted Palestinian 
      refugees to remuneration. </p>

    with the options and modalities set forth in this agreement. PPR options from 
    which the refugees may choose shall be as follows; </p>

      <p>ii. Option iii shall be at the sovereign discretion of third countries 
        and shall be in accordance with numbers that each third country will submit

      </p>
      <p>iii. Option iv shall be at the sovereign discretion of Israel and will 
        be in accordance with a number that Israel will submit to the International

        average of the total numbers submitted by the different third countries 
        to the International Commission. <br>
      </p>
      <p>iv. Option v shall be in accordance with the sovereign discretion of 
        present host countries. Where exercised this shall be in the context of 
        prompt and extensive development and rehabilitation programs for the refugee 
        communities. </p>
      <p>Priority in all the above shall be accorded to the Palestinian refugee 
        population in Lebanon. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

    are committed and will encourage third parties to facilitate the refugees' 
    free choice in expressing their preferences, and to countering any attempts 
    at interference or organized pressure on the process of choice. This will 
    not prejudice the recognition of Palestine as the realization of Palestinian 
    self-determination and statehood. </p>
  <p>6. End of Refugee Status </p>

        Panel. </p>

      &sup3;lump sum&sup2; contribution to the International Fund. No other financial

      Israel's contribution to the International Fund. An estimation of this value 
      shall be made by the International Fund, taking into account assessment 
      of damage caused by the settlements. </p>

      of each individual's refugeehood. The Fund, to which Israel shall be a contributing

      and financing of the Fund is set forth in Annex X. </p>
    <p>(b) Funds will be disbursed to refugee communities in the former areas 
      of UNRWA operation, and will be at their disposal for communal development
