  <p align="center">Turquoise Mountain (Mount Taylor, Grants, NM)</p>
  <p align="left">&gt; &gt; The Reunion of Mother Earth with Her Children at Turquoise 
    Mountain on May 8, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">&gt; &gt; The Indigenous Elders are asking us to stop and think 
    with them, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, to reconnect to ouMother 
    Earth as her children. These unified ceremonies are to awaken everyone, to 
    be done by everyone at the beginning of every season in their own traditional 
    protocol.This is only the beginning of the reorientation and reconnection 
    for Mother Earth and her children. What follows is the traditional protocol 
    for the ceremony on Turquoise Mountain (Mt. Taylor) on May 8th, 2004 as set 
    by Grandfather and Grandmother Martinez, and Leon Secatero, Spiritual Messenger. 
    Grandfather Martin Martinez's vision came to him in the spring of 2002 when 
    he and other medicine people visited the sacred spring on Turquoise Mountain 
    to offer gifts to the mountain and its holy ones as they have always done.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The warriors on horses of long ago appeared. They were carrying 
    a staff with eagle feathers from many nations. The Thunder called to them, 
    &quot;Why aren't you doing the ceremony?&quot; Next, they saw rainbow houses 
    and many people camping in the clearing with their drums in a circle to reset 
    the sky roads of the holy ones. The time had come.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">When Grandfather came down from the mountain he called all his 
    children (The Five Finger Ones) to tell them that a spiritual gathering is 
    to happen at the sacred site on Turquoise Mountain. In the vision, the ancestors 
    came to tell him that it is time to journey to this mountain for the sacred 
    purpose of reconnecting Mother Earth with her children. Since then, many traditional 
    planning meetings have taken place.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">However, there was a question in regards to the participation 
    of many nations and how they are to connect. This connection came together 
    when an Eastern Shoshone Spiritual leader came with a message: Mother Earth 
    is calling all cultures to come together in Sacred Ceremonies now to restore 
    balance and harmony. To help alleviate worldwide concerns about past, present, 
    and future earthquakes and volcanic activities within Yellowstone and Grand 
    Teton National Parks, the elders have envisioned a unified ceremony to include 
    the western territory of North America. All people from all nations are welcome 
    to participate.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">TRADITIONAL PROTOCOL<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">When our Star appears in the East (about 4:00 AM), the mounds 
    for 12 staffs will be marked and put in a circle with an opening to the East. 
    All nations represented with a staff will circle around the center fire for 
    the entrance of the sacred pipes, to be placed in the Four Directions with 
    prayer and song. After the sacred pipes are in place, cleansing with sage 
    and prayer will begin for the staffs. Once the staffs are placed in the mounds, 
    the cleansing for the people and their medicine bundles will begin.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Morning Songs will be sung until dawn. Everyone will come together 
    with their prayer offerings as traditional flute music is played to welcome 
    the Sun as it appears through the aspen forest.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Midmorning (10:00 AM) the participating groups will bring their 
    prayer sticks, with their own designs and colors, to the center west of the 
    central fire. The prayer sticks will be placed in a line representing the 
    participating groups. When the time comes, the south prayer stick will begin 
    their song. When they complete their song, the next prayer stick will start 
    and so forth, until the last one in the north is completed. With with the 
    singing and prayer, two bows -- one a 740-year-old bow representing the ancestors, 
    and a new one representing the Five Finger Ones -- will be used to connect 
    the vibration south to north, and east to west.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Placing of Crystals (11:30 AM) with the prayer sticks will be 
    done before noon. Everyone is invited to place their crystal around the mound 
    of the prayer sticks as the Honoring Song is sung. When the time is right, 
    the Connecting Song will be sung, starting very softly and increasing as more 
    lift the song. All drums, flutes, eagle-bone whistles, and voices will begin 
    with the rhythm of the Medicine Rattle to open up the vibration.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The Sky Path of the Holy Ones is connected at Noon, when the 
    energy is most direct and powerful. The group with the South prayer stick 
    will lead off with their song. They may ask others to join them. After the 
    last prayer stick at the north has sung their song, the singing is open and 
    all the people will join in the healing dance. This is for Mother Earth to 
    acknowledge you, and for you to acknowledge Mother Earth in renewing your 
    sacred relationship with her. The dance will end in the afternoon to prepare 
    for the next ceremony.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Honoring Mother Earth (2:00 PM), after the sacred water is brought 
    in, a tobacco/pipe ceremony will begin. Mother Earth Song will be sung and 
    offerings will be prepared for the water to be placed near the sacred spring, 
    so her seeds will carry the sacred message to the universe when the plants 
    arrive.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Honoring the Sacred Path for the Five Finger Ones will be done 
    with a Mountain Song, ending with the Blessing Way. The prayer sticks will 
    be taken to the mountain spirits for their guidance and wisdom, as our journey 
    begins here. Our first responsibility is to clean up the area before leaving 
    for home to share our experiences with our loved ones.<br>
    <br>
    Grandfather and Grandmother Martinez have given their permission for a certain 
    portion of this event to be videotaped, recorded and distributed for the Martinez 
    family and the building of the Red Mountain Healing Center.<br>

    Subject: The Great Medicine Wheel of May 8 and The KoKoPeli Grid System<br>
    <br>
    Greetings<br>
    It is my honor and great joy to share the Information for the Great Event/Ceremony 
    on May 8 2004 called,&quot;The Great Medicine Wheel---The ReUnion of the Universe 
    and Earth's Children&quot;, and an Informational re: The Three Primary Grid 
    Systems of Earth. Both of these Informations are potent for me as they are 
    aspects of what I am calling my Mandala of Task. Each of the 'colors' or parts 
    of the patterns represent deeply intense Tasks or Purposes for me/my Essence/SoulFamilies. 
    We each have them &amp; they vastly vary in composition. It is part of the 
    large termed &quot;blueprint&quot; or of what I Know as the sacred geometric 
    patterns composed of color, sound and symbols which hold all Information about 
    a person, their vast other life experiences (some call these the 'past lives'), 
    the multidimensional life experience aspects, the Soul, the OverSouls,the 
    Essence &amp; EssenceFamilies and the Seed Races or lineages of an individual. 
    I have included parts of the written text by Tron and also by the Visioner/creating 
    force of the Ceremony, <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Bennie LeBeau and the site addresses so you can further read 
    about this potent Event if it Calls to &amp; resonates with you.<br>
    Please pass this to your connections on your lists!!!<br>
    <br>
    Also, if this greatly resonates with you, I invite you to contact me. I am 
    setting a website &amp; there will be an area for those working on the Grid 
    Systems to connect with each other. The intent is for connections to one another, 
    our TaskGroups and to SoulFamilies. Dream Awake, Love Awake~~~Rebeka Michaels;

    REUNION OF MOTHER EARTH WITH HER CHILDREN Blessing Ceremony For Mother Earth's 
    Mountains &amp; Water<br>
    <br>
    This Great Medicine Wheel spans over 600 miles, from Mt. Taylor (Turquoise 
    Mountain), New Mexico, in the south, to Lake Sullivan, British Columbia, Canada, 
    in the north - from Mt. Shasta, California, in the west, and to Missouri River, 
    South Dakota, in the east. The nineteen points, all moutains, lakes and rivers, 
    that form the circle of this Medicine Wheel are as follows: Sullivan Lake, 
    Saskatchewan River, Qu'appelle River, Souris River, James River, Missouri 
    River, Platte River, Arkansas River, Cimarron River, Colorado River or (Lake 
    Mead), Lake Tahoe, Okanagan Lake, Mt. Taylor, Mt. Humphrey in the San Francisco 
    Peaks, Mt. Whitney, Mt. Shasta, Three Sisters, Mt. Rainier and Lake Louise, 
    while the center point is the Grand Teton Peaks: Four Grandmothers Standing 
    Tall........<br>
    <br>
    Note that this event is happening exactly 6 months following the Harmonic 
    Concordance. - As I write this (April 19th), a very potent New Moon Solar 
    eclipse is active (just as it was on the Harmonic Concordance date), and it 
    is being followed by the just as powerful Wesak Lunar Eclipse on May 4th, 
    a few days preceding the Ceremony.<br>
    <br>
    I am very happy to have been given permission to post on this site an article 
    by Bennie LeBeau about the Ceremony, which he calls The Magnificent Nineteen 
    + 1 = 20. His powerful message speaks for itself. - You will also find here 
    a Tentative Traditional Protocol for the Ceremony. I will be posting updates 
    as they arrive from Bennie - and Suzanne, who is currently helping him answer 
    the many e-mails he is receiving these days...<br>
    <br>
    Let me end this as I started out, by quoting Grand Elder Leon Secatero: 'It 
    is very commendable that our elders and indigenous people have come forth 
    at this critical period to share and teach out traditional ways of friendship, 
    trust, cooperation, and above all, to rebuild a peaceful future of coexistence 
    with our Mother Earth and all beings. This journey is not only for the red 
    people, or for the yellow, black, or white. The journey is for all the Five-Finger 
    Ones, you and me. So please walk with us, not in front of us, not in the back 
    of us, but walk beside us, bringing the new dawn of peace and happiness for 
    our children of the Seven Generations, and for all the living things of the 
    future.' With Love and Blessings on your Path,<br>

  <p align="left">THE MAGNIFICENT NINETEEN + 1 = 20 MEDICINE WHEEL CEREMONY MAY 
    8TH 2004 By Bennie LeBeau<br>
    <br>
    Bennie E LeBeau, Sr., Elder spiritual leader and advisor, is an enrolled tribal 
    member of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, Wind River Indian Reservation, Ft Washakie, 
    WY. He has many years of experience in indigenous tradition and culture with 
    the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. ~ ~ ~ Bennie LeBeau is a member of the Spiritual 
    Elders of Mother Earth, an organization of indigenous prophecy carriers of 
    North America [http://www.spiritualelders.org]. In this capacity, he helps 
    educate his Eastern Shoshone people and other cultures to the significance 
    of sacred sites and the indigenous prophecies. His present emphasis is: To 
    inform all cultures of the importance of protecting and preserving all indigenous 
    sacred sites within this country and across the world, including indigenous 
    prophecies.<br>
    <br>
    The Magnificent Nineteen +1 = 20 The Grand Tetons Blessing Ceremony For Mother 
    Earth's Mountains &amp; Water<br>
    <br>
    A vision of several magnificent and wondrous mountains found in America's 
    North Western peaks has come to ask the Indigenous Nations and humanity to 
    come to the aid of mother earth and her inhabitants. She has asked the Indigenous 
    Nations to assist in the re-connection of humanity's awareness not only to 
    herself, but also to the universal presence of the stars. The dream spoke 
    in a mysterious way, reminding us WE ARE the &quot;keepers of the earth and 
    its sacred wisdom.&quot; WE ARE to help all things and ourselves once again 
    realize that &quot;all things are related&quot; upon earth and within the 
    universe.<br>
    <br>
    The Elementals of earth, wind, fire and water have asked us to prepare the 
    mountain peaks and bodies of water for a powerful ceremony. The ancestral 
    spirits have spoken giving direction to build and reset into harmony a huge 
    medicine wheel. This wheel is to be activated in the spring or summer of 2004, 
    (date will be announced). The boundaries of this medicine wheel will encompass 
    nineteen well-known mountain peaks and bodies of water. It will cover an area 
    whose radius is some 600 miles, with Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming 
    as its center. ...........<br>
    <br>
    The spiritual vision is calling the Indigenous Nations, along with other cultures, 
    living within this 600-mile area to come forth. To come forth putting our 
    relationship with nature back into harmony and order with sacred vibrations. 
    To come forth with the use of sacred prayers, utilizing our drums, songs and 
    sacred vibrational tools. By utilizing prayer, the sacred vibrations of our 
    drums, by chanting our songs, these ancient sites will re-vitalize. The intent 
    of the pre-ceremony is to place back into harmony and balance those lands, 
    mountains and bodies of water that are now ''out-of-harmony.'' Due to the 
    reckless development within these areas that has happened within the United 
    States at large. The dream mentions that when the ceremony takes place negative 
    thought forms, which lie within these areas, will be released allowing the 
    bondages, which have been put upon the land.<br>
    <br>
    Releasing this 600-mile area out of the bondage of negativity for our families, 
    us and for mother earth. By re-attuning these sacred sites to work together 
    with one another, as the ancestor's once did in the past before colonization 
    took place. The ceremony then becomes an important tool to teach all individuals 
    the importance of our mother earth and the blessings she has given all of 
    us. The re-harmonization will help bring back the rains. Many of Mother Earth's 
    womb springs will come to life once again, flowing outward. Water carries 
    the messages of life, while sustaining life, our lifeblood that is blessed 
    by our father sun and watched over by the universal presence. ................<br>
    <br>
    Upon these sacred sites will be placed sacred stones with prayers upon them 
    to hold the energy. Electrically-magnetically charged energy vibrating at 
    a high velocity will heal Grandmother Spider's web. Reconstructing the Web 
    of Life back into a blossoming flower once again. Heaven upon Earth will burst 
    forth and everything will once again emerge into harmony. The rains will fall 
    and the waters and springs will flow again. Plants will grow, animals will 
    flourish and ''all things related'' will prosper. .............<br>
    <br>
    In closing, I pray that the whole world will choose to be aware of this ceremony 
    as it takes place in the spring of 2004. I pray each will choose to be in 
    a sacred site meditating on the peace and harmony we all so desire for our 
    future. The human race is depending on us for WE ARE the &quot;keepers of 
    the earth and its sacred wisdom. &quot;We are the one's we have been waiting 
    for,&quot; Hopi prophecy.<br>

    Greetings my fellow brothers and sisters of the many Nations of Mother Earth: 
    The Magnificent 19 + 1 = 20 ceremony will begin with the morning star. And 
    beginning at sunrise on May 8th, 2004 to sunrise the following mornings sunrise 
    on May 9th. The morning hours of the sun have a very important part to play 
    in this ceremony. The mid point of the 12:00 P.M. noon hour is very important 
    time when the sun is sending down powerful energy that will be set upon our 
    Mother Earth's mountains, valleys, deserts, meadows, waterways and womb spring 
    areas where the water breaks forth from her. The energy from the moon also 
    will play a very important part in helping bring back the rainbows to Mother 
    Earth in more abundance. Many of the Worlds Nations will be in prayer and 
    in sacred thought form, in one heart, one mind and in one spirit for the balance 
    of Mother Earth. In doing so we will bring the electrical ley lines back into 
    activation that were deactivated during the development of Mother Earths surface 
    in the last <br>
    many centuries. I really stress the importance of using our sacred drums, 
    whistles and other vibrational tools. This sound will pull the energy lines 
    back into a balanced manner. These lines are known as ley line, song lines, 
    spirit lines they are all the same in one. Please keep in mind that this is 
    a very special ceremony that is one of a kind and will help teach us how to 
    keep Mother Earth in peace and harmony for the future. ........<br>
    <br>
    Many blessings to us all at this time and may the creator give us all the 
    faith, strength and the courage we will need for the future of our planet, 
    children and all the things that we are related too here above and beyond. 
    Many the many Nations of the World find the peace and harmony that we are 
    all looking for.... many safe journeys to us all in arriving to the 20 sacred 
    sites in the ceremony.... we will need at the courage, strength and wisdom 
    the we have to bring about sacredness to our families that is needed at this 
    time in the history of the world. Again many blessing to us all....<br>

  <p align="left">I attempted to send this Information out at that time and it 
    was interrupted/postponed because of the Information that was provided regarding 
    the Magdalen Grid System, and the Infusion of the Feminine Consciousness of 
    April 9 to 11 2004. For anyone receiving this that is interested in that body 
    of Infromation, please contact Rebeka at: ReBeKa92003@yahoo.com. I heard of 
    this Ceremony only within the I just recently heard of the Ceremony within 
    the last week and it has profound 'rocked my world', so to speak. I was reviewing 
    whether I should return to this Information &amp; send it when I received 
    the confirmation from Tron of TerrAscension &amp; now Know that this is part

    ReBeKa92003@yahoo.com<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Kokopeli was a High Alchemist, a High Alchemical magician , 
    a Galactic Elder and an Ambassador. His Presence was most widely documented 
    in Story during the Anasazi time on earth in the deserts of the southwest. 
    He was Present between the collapsing &amp; disappearance of the Third World 
    and prior to the Fourth World. He was both part of the demise of the Third 
    World and the Creation of the Fourth World. His Alchemy and Task was focused 
    upon creating a matrix and grid system(s) which would remain in place, though 
    not Activated until the Moment between phases in The Great Shift of Consciousness, 
    whereby there were enough cohesive-resonantly Harmonic Energy Fields to support 
    and continue The Great Shift and The Fifth World. These Energy Fields have 
    to be in the vibration of at least the 5th dimension, which is the dimension 
    of Wisdom in Understanding, of Compassion, of the integration of duality &amp; 
    polarity within each of the Holders of these Energy Fields (individuals) and 
    most importantly of LOVE. These Holders are the humans upon Earth, the Animal 
    Realms, the Plant Realms, the Crystal/Mineral Realms, and all sentient Beings 
    in all Realms (such as devic, Earth Angels, Spirit Helpers, etc). <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">It is not just the human vibration that was to Transition into 
    the Fifth World, nor has it been that every other Realm is advanced in vibration. 
    All Realms, All Relations and All Relationships upon &amp; in Earth are Attaining 
    The Great Shift of Consciousness and many will Translate into the Fifth World 
    and many will not. Kokopeli created Sound Filaments of Light particle structures 
    and quantum energies to bring into manifestation the Matrix/Gird/Energy System(s) 
    required to exist between Worlds (the Third to Fourth and the Fourth to the 
    Fifth World). It has been eons of generations who have cared for, have done 
    maintainence upon, have kept energized, and who have kept stable this System 
    or Systems for this exact moment. There are almost uncountable descriptions 
    of the types and forms of 'Grid Work' a person, a Soul, a Soul Group/Family 
    and even a Soul Generation have performed, completed &amp; The Work continues 
    to this Day! Those who have in their Soul Contracts to work upon this/these 
    System(s) are just Now becoming conscious of this Work, of this Duty and this 
    Honor. This/these System(s) are defined as the 2nd of the 3 major Grid Systems 
    Designed for earth &amp; human evolution/ascension processes and is directly 
    related in this message as the System Created by Kokopeli. It is not an Honor 
    set 'above' others, it is an Honor in that it is specialized Work Accomplished 
    by those who love doing this Type of Service, have done this Work for eons 
    upon Earth and many other Stars/Planet Systems.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">It is a cellular-lineage-bred type of Service. It is no different 
    or more in Honor than any of the other Honor Services which abound. It is 
    just a different Form of Service. It is the human capacity of emotion, polarity 
    and duality that might separate this category of Service. It is a misconception 
    in humans in which they believe if they are Called to the Grids to work, that 
    'they' are the one who 'Activates' a matrix, grid or system. It is that the 
    cellular program has been encoded so to produce that feeling &amp;/or response 
    to ensure that work in the physical realm i completed. Each is important and 
    no one person 'activates' a grid or system. All individuals work in phases, 
    and in-sync with others to cleanse, energize and maintain the systems for 
    which they are Coded for. It is also true and we upon Earth are beginning 
    to experience this Now, that specific individuals have been very intricately 
    &amp; cellularly bred to come forward at this Time and during these Energies 
    which are Presencing upon Earth Now to be energeticly overlayed and to merge 
    their entire LightBody with their physical body (this is inclusive with the 
    SoulEssence, Soul Family's Oversoul and the multidimensional OverSouls necessary 
    for this Work at this Time) in Order to Activate 2 of the 3 primary Grid Systems 
    for evolution, involution and the ascension processes. This is a rare and 
    unique opportunity for the humanity and Realms of Earth. This is a sequence 
    within the evolution/involution/ascension Process which has never been able 
    to be accomplished on Earth. Each of the 3 Systems function in very specific 
    Codes, Task &amp; Purpose, and have been created, prepared and maintained 
    to be used during the many diverse phases of The Shift of Consciousness over 
    many millennia. There are Codes, Sacred Geometric Codes, and filament matrices 
    which are capable of Holding the energies necessary to ensure the 'Potential' 
    of success for the Shift from the 3rd to 4th World and the 4th to the 5th 
    World...and there is no guarantee that the Transition into the 5th World will 
    be absolute. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">There has been the Potential, and this is why these very specific 
    and unique individuals are brought forth at this Time. These individuals have 
    the appearance of being quite normal in the physical world. It is the genetic 
    Codes that each Contain that make this Time and these Activations so very 
    special and so very urgent in the Task for success. The Codes in each of these 
    individuals must be Activated within themselves, must resonate at a deliberate 
    &amp; cohesive Harmonic, they must 'come on line' (so to speak) with the Ones 
    who Initiated these 2 Systems and then they must Harmonize many, many, many 
    levels of energetic frequency to be able to Hold the proper vibration for 
    Activation and also radiate these vibrations into and on the Grid Systems. 
    There are 2 now on the Original Grid Systems/Lands, 3 on the' extension' of 
    both Grid Systems and where they anchor into Lands of north America and 1 
    on the 'abutment' of the Kokopeli Bridge in Australia. There are numerous 
    assistants which as stated prior, have been cellularly Code to assist and 
    are Awakening to this Purpose at this Time. This Awakening for some will not 
    be made conscious until after the Work and Activation has occurred. Many will 
    wonder if they have the Codes. It is to be said that the Knowing of this genetic 
    Calling is not of nor from human ego. Those who are to Accomplish this Task 
    now, are of humble Heart and quiet intentions. They will feel the Fire of 
    the Call and say little. They will be Called to the Original Lands of the 
    UK, of Australia, &amp; of the southwest in North America. These are the major 
    abutment and anchor points for the 2 Systems. There are what are known as 
    'extensions' where the filaments were 'stretched' over other Lands to physically 
    anchor the energetics of these evolution/involution/ascension Grids and Matrices. 
    These are referred to as Minor Systems which are still very much Contained 
    within the Major Systems. Kokopeli created a matrix/grid System(s) which is 
    one of Three such elaborate Systems which were placed between The Worlds and 
    is in Use for the Transition of The Great Shift (The Law of Three for this 
    planet and this universe which is necessary for all alchemy &amp; transformation).</p>
  <p align="left"> The other two Systems are also about Sound, for Sound is the 
    binding, as it were, for Light, Sound, Color and quantum energies to form 
    an Order or Pattern that has a form. This Form, in the quantum realms, is 
    energetic and absolutely no less profound than the physical reality of 3d 
    matter. In Truth, it is more stable and more powerful because the energies 
    cannot be destroyed like physicalness. The other two Systems are the Consciousness 
    Matrix &amp; Grid Systems created by the Grand Feminine The Magdalen and those 
    who assisted Her over the years of this Great Service. This System was created 
    to &quot;Hold together the Worlds&quot; during The Dark Years, during the 
    Transition, during the Translation, during the Transformation of the Fourth 
    World into the Fifth World. This System of the Great Feminine's has The Purpose 
    to integrate polarity &amp; duality within each person and their consciousness. 
    This System Serves through and by Sacred Relationship. Sacred Relationship 
    of the Self, and of others joining together in many forms. These forms are 
    primarily of the self and of intimate relationships, because these are the 
    foundations for any and all other conscious elevations or Illuminations which 
    are of The Fifth World. They Contain the Knowing that evolution was the Attribute 
    of the previous Four Worlds and Involution is Ascension or Illumination of 
    the Fifth World. Involution is also the Way of Life in the fifth dimension 
    and the Fifth World. The third Matrix/Grid Systems mentioned here is of the 
    Harmonics of the Cetaceans. Please note that these Systems mentioned are NOT 
    in the order in which they were Created. The Cetaceans' Origin is many, many 
    universes and StarPortals from Earth. They have been in existence since the 
    very Seedingof this World. Their consciousness has taken many forms &amp; 
    They have Translated all Four Worlds. They adopted/created the present cetacean 
    body between the First and Second Worlds. They are interdimensional travelers. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">This is important, not because it is a colorful piece of a story, 
    it is potent because those who Serve and Work on the Three Matrix and Grid 
    Systems of this planet we have just mentioned are also interdimensional travelers. 
    This is nothing new to you, however----what is important in this is that the 
    cetaceans which seem to die or disappear as the world counts these individuals 
    each year, are NOT dead nor have they been destroyed/removed because of 'bad 
    deeds' from humans. They interdimensionally travel and are continually monitoring 
    ALL Harmonics on all grids, on all levels, for ALL Beings and Realms upon 
    earth &amp; IN Earth. They choose physical form for Contact, to assist in 
    making Shifts for an area or for individuals, &amp; this is in the perspective 
    that humans now Hold or 'take on' more of the Harmonics which the cetaceans 
    have Held for eons upon eons. It is the most ancient of Grid Systems upon 
    and in earth. It is the most important, because they, for Four Worlds, have 
    Held together a cohesive harmonic which allowed all sentient beings upon earth 
    to evolve and continue in duality or physicalness. Now, as WE Enter the Fifth 
    World, and humans are now fully capable to Hold the Harmonics for many of 
    the Grids of earth, these Beings will loosen their focus upon Holding their 
    physicalness &amp; many will seem to 'disappear' from our physical presence. 
    It is Time, within The Great Shift of Consciousness, that These Great Ones 
    Return to Their Realms and They will be OUR Teachers and Leaders as We manifest 
    our Fifth World and our New World. They will not leave the Earth totally, 
    they will merge into the more rarified dimensions &amp; will continue to visit, 
    be seen, converse with and Offer Their Wisdom and guidance to those who are 
    now the Leaders for the New World, the 5th World and the 5d/6d consciousness. 
    It is these who are the ones to bring new technology into our Fifth World. 
    It exists, of course, Now and it is the Service of some to stablize the physical 
    realms when We Enter the Fifth World. Already, the Concepts, the Visions, 
    the new Systems of Life are manifesting and it is these which will be taken 
    into the next World. New modalities in medicine, in holistic being, in 'education' 
    systems, in Living Exchange (to replace commerce, commercialism, money,etc) 
    all are present Now &amp; so there will be no loss, no trauma, no struggle, 
    no survival necessary. The actual means of </p>
  <p align="left">Accomplishment and Plan of this is in place as well, and many 
    have Theories about it. For now, this Transmission is focusing upon the Three 
    Systems which Hold the World experienced in form and of some of the upcoming 
    Information to be utilized prior to the actual Shift. *The First Matrix or 
    Grid System(s) was Created by the Harmonics of the Cetaceans. **The Second 
    Matrix or Grid System(s) was Created by a high alchemical master and galactic 
    Elder and the most predominant name this being is known by through Story is 
    Kokopeli. The Third Matrix or Grid System(s) was Created by the Illuminated 
    Conscious Emotions of Love, Compassion, Joy by The Grand Feminine The Magdalen 
    It is this 'Informational focus' for the Third System I Transmission because 
    there is much Wisdom &amp; Knowing of the Systems the Cetaceans created and 
    are maintaining and this Information comes from many sources. There is Now 
    Presencing on Earth, the Truth of the System which The Grand Feminine The 
    Magdalen created which has enabled and supported all those who strive for 
    involution, polarity &amp; duality integration and Illumination into the Realms 
    of Love, Compassion and Joy. It is through the survival of this System that 
    Now has Activated and Enabled the Third System to be Accessed. There is much 
    Truth Illuminating the stories, lies and misinformations of this Great Being. 
    She is, as is the feminine aspect of this world, becoming Illuminated &amp; 
    Honored in Right Order with the masculine aspect and this is the foundational 
    Step for all who desire to Enter the Fifth World. We are not stating homage 
    to this Being, we state, to Open the Heart and Mind to the Attributes/Attainments 
    of Love, Compassion and Joy that She can assist one in for their individual 
    ascension process and involution. Her Service to our world and the ascension 
    process for/of earth is for those residing upon earth as well as the entire 
    local universe, because what is Attained here during The Great Shift will 
    have effects throughout all existence. There is also a great amount of Information 
    on many, many levels of Understanding about those who have been energizing, 
    maintaining, hiding and have Held in Protection the System(s) The Magdalen 
    created many thousands of your years ago. For those who are magnetized to 
    the Matrix/Grid System(s) or Know they have been a part of the Creation, protection, 
    energizing and Translation of this System for Elevated/Illuminated Consciousness, 
    please refer to the Information The Magdalen is Presencing through Tom Kenyon 
    and Judi Sion (channel's note: www.tomkenyon.com &lt;http://www.tomkenyon.com/&gt; 
    and The Magdalen Manuscript)<br>
