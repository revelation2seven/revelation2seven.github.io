  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;One of the Hymns states that 
    God's light will eventually shine Sevenfold strong. The basic idea has, of 
    course, good Old Testament authority (Isaiah 30:25,26; Isa.60:19), but it 
    is interesting to observe that, even according to the Talmud (Sanh.91b), the 
    light of the Messianic sun will be Seven times as powerful as usual.&quot;
