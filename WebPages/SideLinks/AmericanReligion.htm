<div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> AMERICA IS NOW 
  A RELIGION <br>
  By George Monbiot<br>
  The Guardian - UK<br>
  7-28-3 </font> </div>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">US leaders now see themselves as 
  priests of a divine mission to rid the world of its demons...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The death of Uday and Qusay,&quot; 
  the commander of the ground forces in Iraq told reporters on Wednesday, &quot;is 
  definitely going to be a turning point for the resistance.&quot; Well, it was 
  a turning point, but unfortunately not of the kind he envisaged. On the day 
  he made his announcement, Iraqi insurgents killed one US soldier and wounded 
  six others. On the following day, they killed another three; over the weekend 
  they assassinated five and injured seven. Yesterday they slaughtered one more 
  and wounded three. This has been the worst week for US soldiers in Iraq since 
  George Bush declared that the war there was over. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Few people believe that the resistance 
  in that country is being coordinated by Saddam Hussein and his noxious family, 
  or that it will come to an end when those people are killed. But the few appear 
  to include the military and civilian command of the United States armed forces. 
  For the hundredth time since the US invaded Iraq, the predictions made by those 
  with access to intelligence have proved less reliable than the predictions made 
  by those without. And, for the hundredth time, the inaccuracy of the official 
  forecasts has been blamed on &quot;intelligence failures&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The explanation is wearing a little 
  thin. Are we really expected to believe that the members of the US security 
  services are the only people who cannot see that many Iraqis wish to rid themselves 
  of the US army as fervently as they wished to rid themselves of Saddam Hussein? 
  What is lacking in the Pentagon and the White House is not intelligence (or 
  not, at any rate, of the kind we are considering here), but receptivity. Theirs 
  is not a failure of information, but a failure of ideology. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To understand why this failure persists, 
  we must first grasp a reality which has seldom been discussed in print. THE 
  UNITED STATES IS NO LONGER JUST A NATION. IT IS NOW A RELIGION. Its soldiers 
  have entered Iraq to liberate its people not only from their dictator, their 
  oil and their sovereignty, BUT ALSO FROM THEIR DARKNESS. As George Bush told 
  his troops on the day he announced victory: &quot;Wherever you go, you carry 
  a message of hope - a message that is ancient and ever new. IN THE WORDS OF 
  THE PROPHET ISAIAH, 'TO THE CAPTIVES, &quot;COME OUT,&quot; AND TO THOSE IN 
  DARKNESS, &quot;BE FREE.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So American soldiers are no longer 
  merely terrestrial combatants; THEY HAVE BECOME MISSIONARIES. They are no longer 
  simply killing enemies; THEY ARE CASTING OUT DEMONS. The people who reconstructed 
  the faces of Uday and Qusay Hussein carelessly forgot to restore the pair of 
  little horns on each brow, but the understanding that these were opponents from 
  a different realm was transmitted nonetheless. Like all those who send missionaries 
  abroad, THE HIGH PRIESTS OF AMERICA conceive that the infidels might resist 
  through their own free will; if they refuse to convert, it is the work of the 
  devil, in his current guise as the former dictator of Iraq. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Clifford Longley shows in his 
  fascinating book Chosen People, published last year, the founding fathers of 
  the USA, though they sometimes professed otherwise, sensed that they were guided 
  by a divine purpose. THOMAS JEFFERSON ARUGUED THAT THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED 
  STATES SHOULD DEPICT THE ISRAELITES, &quot;LED BY A CLOUD BY DAY AND A PILLAR 
  OF FIRE BY NIGHT&quot;. George Washington claimed, in his inaugural address, 
  that every step towards independence was &quot;distinguished by some token of 
  providential agency&quot;. Longley argues that the formation of the American 
  identity was part of a process of &quot;supersession&quot;. The Roman Catholic 
  church claimed that it had supplanted the Jews as the elect, as the Jews had 
  been repudiated by God. The English Protestants accused the Catholics of breaking 
  faith, and claimed that they had become the beloved of God. The American revolutionaries 
  believed that the English, in turn, had broken their covenant: THAT AMERICANS 
  HAD NOW BECOME THE CHOSEN PEOPLE, WITH A DIVINE DUTY TO DELIVER THE WORLD TO 
  GOD'S DOMINION. Six weeks ago, as if to show that this belief persists, GEORGE 
  BUSH RECALLED A REMARK OF WOODROW WILSON'S. &quot;AMERICA,&quot; HE QUOTED, 
  &quot;HAS A SPIRITUAL ENERGY IN HER WHICH NO OTHER NATION CAN CONTRIBUTE TO 
  THE LIBERATION OF MANKIND.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gradually this notion of election 
  has been conflated with another, still more dangerous idea. It is not just that 
  the Americans are God's chosen people; America itself is now perceived as a 
  divine project. In his farewell presidential address, RONALD REAGAN SPOKE OF 
  HIS COUNTRY AS A &quot;SHINING CITY ON A HILL&quot; A REFERENCE TO THE SERMON 
  ON THE MOUNT. But what Jesus was describing was not a temporal Jerusalem, but 
  the kingdom of heaven. Not only, in Reagan's account, was God's kingdom to be 
  found in the United States of America, but the kingdom of hell could also now 
  be located on earth: the &quot;evil empire&quot; of the Soviet Union, AGAINST 
  WHICH HIS HOLY WARRIORS WERE PITCHED. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SINCE THE ATTACKS ON NEW YORK, THIS 
  NOTION OF AMERICA THE DIVINE HAS BEEN EXTENDED AND REFINED. In December 2001, 
  Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of that city, delivered his last mayoral speech IN 
  ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL, close to the site of the shattered twin towers. &quot;All 
  that matters,&quot; he claimed, &quot;is that you embrace America and understand 
  its ideals and what it's all about. Abraham Lincoln used to say THAT THE TEST 
  OF YOUR AMERICANISM WAS...HOW MUCH YOU BELIEVED IN AMERICA. BECAUSE WE'RE LIKE 
  A RELIGION REALLY. A SECULAR RELIGION.&quot; The chapel in which he spoke had 
  been consecrated not just by God, but by the fact that George Washington had 
  once prayed there. It was, he said, now &quot;sacred ground to people who feel 
  what America is all about&quot;. The United States of America no longer needs 
  to call upon God; it is God, and those who go abroad to spread the light do 
  so in the name of a celestial domain. THE FLAG HAS BECOME AS SACRED AS THE BIBLE; 
  THE NAME OF THE NATION AS HOLY AS THE NAME OF GOD.THE PRESIDENCY IS TURNING 
  INTO A PRIESTHOOD. (Of course it already was the pulpit of the Wicked Priest...See 
  the chapter entitled The Teacher of (Un)Righteousness)...</font></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So those who question George Bush's 
  foreign policy are no longer merely critics; they are blasphemers, or &quot;anti-Americans&quot;. 
  Those foreign states which seek to change this policy are wasting their time: 
  you can negotiate with politicians; you cannot negotiate with priests. THE US 
  HAS A DIVINE MISSION, AS BUSH SUGGESTED IN JANUARY, &quot;TO DEFEND...THE HOPES 
  OF ALL MANKIND&quot;, and woe betide those who hope for something other than 
  the American way of life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dangers of national divinity 
  scarcely require explanation. Japan went to war in the 1930s convinced, like 
  George Bush, that it possessed a heaven-sent mission to &quot;liberate&quot; 
  Asia and extend the realm of its divine imperium. It would, the fascist theoretician 
  Kita Ikki predicted: &quot;LIGHT THE DARKNESS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD&quot;. Those 
  who seek to drag heaven down to earth are destined only to engineer a hell.
