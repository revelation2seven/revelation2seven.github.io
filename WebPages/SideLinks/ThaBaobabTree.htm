  </a>The baobab is found in the savannas of African and India, mostly around 
  the equator. It can grow up to 25 meters tall and can live for several thousand 
  years. The baobab is leafless for nine months of the year. If I were to describe 
  the baobab, I would say that it looks like it has been picked out of the ground 
  and stuffed back in upside-down. The trunk would be the tap-root, and the branches 
  the finer capillary roots.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003300">The 
  Arabian legend of the boabab is that &quot;the devil plucked up the baobab, 
  thrust its branches into the earth and left its roots in the air.&quot; Another 
  legend describes what happens if you are never satisfied with what you already 
  have.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003300">&quot;The 
  baobab was among the first trees to appear on the land. Next came the slender, 
  graceful palm tree. When the baobab saw the palm tree, it cried out that it 
  wanted to be taller. Then the beautiful flame tree appeared with its red flower 
  and the baobab was envious for flower blossoms. When the baobab saw the magnificent 
  fig tree it prayed for fruit as well. The gods became angry with the tree and 
  pulled it up by its roots, then replanted it upside down to keep it quiet.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#003300">The 
  baobab looks like this for a reason. In the wet months water is stored in its 
  thick, corky, fire-resistant trunk for the nine dry months ahead. The baobab's 
  bark, leaves, fruit, and trunk are all used. The bark of the baobab is used 
  for cloth and rope, the leaves for condiments and medicines, while the fruit, 
  called &quot;monkey bread,&quot; is eaten. Sometimes people live inside of the 
  huge trunks, and bush-babies live in the crown.</font></p>

<p align=justify><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">THE LEGEND OF THE AFRICAN 
  BAO-BAB TREE is the story of a beautiful tree who complained to the GREAT SPIRIT 
  of the WILD PLAINS about wanting to be the BEST and BRIGHTEST and most HANDSOME 
  of all the African trees. The GREAT SPIRIT became tired of the complaints, and 
  reached down from the sky, yanked the tree out of the ground and placed it back 
  into the earth UPSIDE DOWN! All the animals were alarmed, and so was the huge 
  tree. For after that, the magnificent tree only grew leaves once a year. The 
  other months the ROOTS seemed to bend and grow towards the sky. Bobby Dooley

<p align="center"><b><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="darkblue" size="2">The 
  Baobab History</font></b> </p>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  Baobab Tree is a symbol of the strength of Africa. There are any myths and legends 
  about the Baobab Tree and it is revered for its healing properties. The most 
  common myth is that the gods in error, planted the Baobab tree upside, hence 
  its strange shape. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">In 
  June 1999 I received a message from a plant spirit to go and make the essence 
  of a beautiful white flower which I saw as a vision in my mind during a mediatation. 
  It had large white petals and a profusion of white stamens emerging from it. 
  I later found out the flower I had seen was that of the Baobab Tree. I was asked 
  to go in December 1999 to the north of South Africa to make the remedy, and 
  was told that it would help to "heal the scars of South Africa" and bring black 
  and white people together. The struggle for freedom in South Africa has become 
  a symbol for the struggle more widely in the world to end wars and inequality. 
  The Baobab Flower Essence will be helpful to anybody who wishes to further this 
  cause, as well as those that have been directly and indirectly affected by racism, 
  oppression and war. The essence will help to balance the collective energies 
  of all people in the world. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  signature of the Baobab Flower Remedy is that it will assist in the spiritual 
  transformation in the exciting times we live in at the beginning of the Age 
  of Aquarius. The flower is a large, white waxy flower with 5 petals. The flower 
  has a prehistoric feel to it, and is pollinated by fruit bats. The Baobab has 
  5 petals and 5 leaves, and the number 5 in numerology represents the emotional 
  plane (the heart). The flower essence relates specifically to the heart and 
  crown chakras, opening our hearts and minds to the higher forces of the Universe. 
  The essence will help people to see how spiritually we are all ONE on the same 
  journey home. The word Baobab means "the time when man began", a time where 
  we were all One and our journey home is to return to this state of being, oneness 
  with other human beings and nature. The new millennium also marks a time for 
  a new beginning of man and woman, as the consciousness of Oneness continues 
  to expand and grow across the globe. It is a time where people are increasingly 
  taking responsibility for their own lives, health and the environment rather 
  than relying on governments or other institutions. The success of this journey 
  will mean an end to all forms of war, oppression and ecological destruction 
  as our respect for all life becomes central to our way of thinking. The Baobab 
  Flower Essence is a gift from nature to help humanity on this journey. The ascending 
  astrological sign of the Baobab Essence is Aries, which is the start of the 
  zodiac and indicates the start of a new cycle. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  Essence is able to heal wounds from lifetimes in the Age of Pisces as well as 
  the Age of Aries. The Age of Aries started when Moses led the Jews out of bondage, 
  according to the bible. It is also reputed that the Archangel Raphael gave Moses 
  the book of all herbs to heal maladies. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  other distinctive feature of the Baobab Tree is that it can undergo a huge amount 
  of mutilation, and still continue to thrive and heal. For example, I visited 
  a Baobab Tree with a pub inside it near Magoebaskloof, which amazingly was still 
  alive and well. This indicates that the Flower remedy of the tree can heal even 
  the deepest scars and mutilation of body and spirit. It is a tree of incredible 
  resilience, strength and self-healing properties. It is interesting that a Baobab 
  Tree of South Africa has chosen to give us this gift, where the divide between 
  black and white people has been most marked, and has caused very deep wounds 
  and spiritual and emotional damage to both the oppressed and oppressors. The 
  astrological birthchart of the essence also indicates that it can heal very 
  deep wounds, particularly emotional and spiritual wounds. Chiron (the Wounded 
  Healer Archetype), Vulcan (a hypothetical transneptunian planet who helps to 
  put our dismembered and fragmented bits back together), Pluto (the unconscious 
  and dark side) and the Sun (the heart) are all found in the 9th House of the 
  Chart, the house of long distance travel. In one case the Baobab Essence healed 
  a flesh wound virtually overnight. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  Baobab Essence has been very useful for pain, for example back pain or pain 
  caused by arthritis, again having almost instantaneous results. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  leaves of the Baobab Tree resemble an outstretched hand, hence its Latin name 
  Adansonia Digitata, as if reaching out in friendship. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  Baobab is unusual in that it is approximately 90% water, and swells up after 
  the rains. It is therefore a tree that mirrors a human being and the earth, 
  which are also comprised of 90% water. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  bark and leaves of the Baobab tree are used medicinally by the indigenous people 
  of the area for a number of physical illnesses including chest complaints, fever 
  and malaria. The flower essence of the tree may also help with these illnesses. 
  The flower of the tree is the most evolved part of the plant and therefore contains 
  the medicinal properties of the whole. In bushmen paintings women are depicted 
  with breasts of the Baobab fruit, and the essence may help with fertility. The 
  flower essence also holds the wisdom of all the incarnations of the tree and 
  all other trees of its species. As the tree is prehistoric this is a lot of 
  wisdom! As previously mentioned the essence may also help to heal flesh wounds. 
  Many people have reported that the Baobab has good (miraculous in a few cases) 
  effects on pain, especially for the back and related to arthritis. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  Baobab Flower Remedy was made in Messina, near the border of South Africa and 
  Zimbabwe on the 14th December 1999. It was made in the cycle of the brightest 
  Full Moon for 173 years on the Summer Solstice on the 22 December 1999. This 
  area lies on the great rift of Africa which in ancient times was called Gondwanaland 
  before the continents split. Many believe this is the place where man/woman 
  began. </font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="-1">The 
  tree is one of the largest in Southern Africa and is 4000 years old. This area 
  of South Africa, Mpumalanga, is one of the few where the traditional spiritual 
  beliefs of the indigenous people, the Venda have survived the ravages of Apartheid. 
  It is the home of the Rain Queen who has great powers. There are many sacred 
  forests and lakes in the area and it is a landscape of exquisite beauty. The 
  area is also close to the Kruger National Park, one of the largest game reserves 
  in Africa.</font>

  on Religious Pluralism in Africa</b><br>

  </center><p><center>
</center>
<br>
<b><font face="arial" color="navy"><font color="#000000" size="-1">"Truth is like 
a baobab tree; one person's arms cannot embrace it" </font><font color="#000000" size="-1">(African 
proverb)</font></font></b> 
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">Protagonists of religious traditions 
  which lay exclusive claim to divine revelation have tended to regard Africa 
  as a blankly barren land, waiting to be planted and watered with the heavenly 
  seeds of truth which are found in their particular religious traditions. This 
  assumption fuelled the Christian missionary enterprise in the past two centuries 
  and continues, unabated, to this day. And although the agents of the missionary 
  enterprise have changed, the assumption persists, albeit in modified form, in 
  the evangelistic work of the fundamentalist groups, some indigenous African 
  churches, as well as the mission-founded churches. </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">The zeal to evangelize left no 
  room to accommodate local religion-cultural traditions which were deemed to 
  be palpably wrong and had to be done away with. And to drive home the point 
  that truth and error could not coexist, cultic symbols, shrines and sacred groves 
  were destroyed. </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">The close identification of the 
  Gospel with the self-image of its propagators led to the unquestioning conviction 
  that God had clearly and decisively acted in their history, and that they were 
  under divine obligation to bring others, in whose history God had apparently 
  not acted, into the arena of this salvation history. And the fundamental questions 
  as to whether God acts in other people's histories and what those histories 
  tell us about God, as well as whether history is the only arena of God's self-disclosure, 
  remained unasked and unanswered. </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">The relationship between the Gospel 
  and local traditions was considered to be that of total discontinuity, which 
  tended to severely and fastidiously limit God's revelatory activity to one event. 
  But to recognize continuity between the Gospel and other traditions is to accept 
  the fact that in no human history has God been absent; and that God could not 
  be dormant in one historical place or period and active in another. </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">It may be that in their passionate 
  eagerness to emphasize the centrality of Jesus and the newness of Christianity, 
  theologians inadvertently created a dichotomy in God's truth and claimed the 
  right to evaluate God's revelatory acts in the histories of other people. </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">Such hardened positions led to 
  the strenuous efforts at converting others and ignored the possibility of human 
  error in the appropriation of divine revelation or truth. Human understanding 
  was invested with a degree of absoluteness which is out of step with our finiteness; 
  and it was almost as if the arms of Christianity alone could completely embrace 
  the baobab tree of divine truth, and that God's thoughts had to coincide with 
  human thoughts. </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">The existence of a plurality of 
  religions is not to be interpreted as a failure on the part of those who have 
  the truth to carry out their divine mission to bring all humankind into the 
  fold. Nor does this point to the hardness of the hearts of other people. On 
  the contrary, it expresses the spirit of God which blows "where it listeth". 
  And to insist on the same response to the experience of God's spirit is to argue 
  for a uniformity which refuses to respect differences. </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">Above all, claims to truth must 
  be related to the lives of those who claim monopoly over it. For if the truth 
  is to be rescued from the realm of theory and propaganda, then is must be reflected 
  in the lives of those who lay claim to it. For religious traditions should help 
  humankind to attain and maintain the highest human values - values which make 
  us more human and are fundamental to our ultimate good, and which uphold harmony 
  and order among the community of nations in the world and in our societies. 
  </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">There is need to go beyond the 
  acceptance of religious plurality to a stage where each religious tradition 
  will bear witness to its faith by doing worthy deeds, and express rivalry, not 
  in contentious disputations about who is right and who is wrong, but by striving 
  to undo each other in improving the lot of humankind, in enhancing the quality 
  of human life and in doing what is good. And if we can compare the improvement 
  in the lot of humanity to building a house, then the meaning of the African 
  proverb which says: "Let the elephant fell the trees, let the bushpig dig the 
  holes, let the mason wasp fill in the walls, let the giraffe put up the roof, 
  then we will have a house", will become clear. </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">If we recognize that the arms 
  of our particular religious traditions cannot fully embrace the baobab tree 
  of truth, it will engender an attitude of respect for others and rescue us from 
  a position of assumed superiority and righteousness which entitles us to declare, 
  in advance, what God will do in the present and at the end of time. </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">My own researches and reflections 
  over the past three decades in Africa, have led me to an openness which I believe 
  will rid us of the tendency to disrespect others because their beliefs are inferior 
  to ours. And in any case, how can people be saved if they are being despised? 
  Or is this the price to pay for salvation, whatever we mean by it? </font>
<p><font face="arial" color="#000000" size="-1">I have also been forced to rethink 
  our efforts to force God to be what we "know" God to be, without allowing God 
  to manifest God's self in multifarious ways. It has become clear to me that 
  our inability to live with differences or pluralism is a measure of our limited 
  knowledge (arms too short to embrace the totality of the baobab tree of truth), 
  rather than an incomparable divine command to impose uniformity in belief and 
  expression on all humanity. </font>
