  <p align="center">Most Victims Of The Intifada Innocent Bystanders<br>
    By Orit Shochat<br>
    Haaretz.com<br>
    3-3-4</p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    &quot;Forget trying to justify the death of a 6-year-old... Better to kill 
    the boy and just feel guilty about it.&quot; <br>
    Professor Asa Kasher agreed to help the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) formulate 
    an ethical code to justify killing those who mastermind, encourage, plan or 
    carry out terror attacks - and also innocents who happen to be in the area 
    of a targeted hit. Kasher has broadened the concept of &quot;ticking bomb&quot; 
    to include anyone suspected by Israeli intelligence of having any connection 
    to a bomb.</p>
  <p align="left"> In olden days, this concept was more concrete. It allowed interrogators 
    to put pressure on someone who had access to timely information about an attack. 
    Now the ticking bomb has gone from being an operational code word to a woolly, 
    philosophical term and the intelligence services have been granted a free 
    hand in determining who deserves to die. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">But broadening the ticking bomb concept works both ways. Taken 
    far enough, Kasher himself, who is on very close terms with those who are 
    working to wipe out terror, might be considered a ticking bomb from the Palestinian 
    perspective. After all, Kasher talks to those who carry out targeted hits, 
    those who give the green light and those who sit and plan them. He meets with 
    the ideologues, the initiators and the big chiefs. He advises them, provides 
    them with moral support, drafts their defense arguments and soothes their 
    consciences. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">In Kasher's eyes, an organized army is always more ethical than 
    a terror organization because military operations are designed to hit military 
    targets and stay clear of civilians. Anyone who looks at the intifada casualty 
    lists knows how wrong he is. Over the past few years, IDF soldiers have had 
    such light trigger fingers that most victims of the intifada have been innocent 
    bystanders. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">When it comes to targeted attacks from the air, Kasher's moral 
    assumptions are even more mistaken. The fact that innocent people will die 
    is taken into account during the planning of these operations. It is not just 
    a matter of luck or lack of caution. Killing innocents is an integral part 
    of the order. In targeted assassinations, writes Kasher, &quot;one is forced 
    to accept there may be collateral damage.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The majority of intifada victims on the Israeli side have also 
    been innocent bystanders - older women on the way to visit their grandchildren, 
    an entire family lunching at a restaurant wiped out of life. Looking at the 
    statistics, it gets even sadder. On both sides, most of the victims have been 
    poor, hardworking people - not the ones who drive around in fancy cars. Even 
    the restaurants targeted by suicide bombers are cheap diners, not gourmet 
    establishments. Someone should do the math one day and find out how many people 
    who barely eke out a living pay with their lives in wars. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">If a philosophy professor on the Palestinian side framed an 
    ethical code for terror, what would it look like? Ahmed Yassin, in his less 
    elegant way, reframes such a code after every terror attack. He says that 
    Hamas prefers killing soldiers over civilians, and settlers over ordinary 
    Israelis. But in his eyes, all Israelis, or at least the overwhelming majority 
    of them, judging from the election results, have been supporting occupation 
    for thirty-odd years. They finance the settlements and serve in the army, 
    and even when they're back in civilian life, they are potential reservists. 
    So as far as he's concerned, they're all ticking bombs in the broad sense 
    of the word. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Widening the circle of guilt is possible on both sides. Would 
    a bus where 80 percent of the passengers are soldiers and 20 percent are women 
    and children be an ethical target for a suicide bomber? Are the women and 
    children merely &quot;collateral damage?&quot; Are the soldiers &quot;ticking 
    bombs,&quot; as Kasher's criteria would seem to imply? A Palestinian could 
    say that soldiers traveling home on a bus will be back on their bases tomorrow, 
    and might conceivably kill Palestinians. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">None of this justifies killing innocent people on any side. 
    But the attempt to establish an ethical code for the war on terror is no different 
    from laying down rules for legitimate terror targets. Ultimately, defining 
    who is innocent and who constitutes the brains or the driving spirit behind 
    an act of terror, is in the eye of the beholder. The same is true for defining 
    what constitutes an ethical target. That is why ethical codes like Asa Kasher's 
    should not be written. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Morality is not something that can be reinvented in keeping 
    with changing defense needs. Moral laws are set in stone in every covenant 
    and constitution. They are part of every religion. If there is no choice but 
    to kill, better that it be done without an ethical code, without some university 
    educator trying to take away the pain. Forget trying to justify the death 
    of a 6-year-old who happened to be standing next to the Subaru of an Islamic 
    Jihad operative when it was hit by an Apache helicopter missile. Better to 
    kill the boy and just feel guilty about it, without all the excuses. Let those 
    who embark on such a mission know that they do so with only the law and their 
    own consciences to rely on - not some prettified, off-the-rack reply brief.

  <p align="center"><b>ORTHODOX JEWS TO BURN ISRAELI FLAG</b> <b>- INTERNATIONAL 
    CEREMONY</b><br>
    <b>Demonstration Of The Essence Of The Holiday 'Purim'<br>
    3-5-04</b></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    MONSEY, NY -- Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, spokesman for Neturei Karta International, 
    announced today that the organization of anti - Zionist Jews will publicly 
    burn the Israeli flag in a series of ceremonies around the world on &quot;Purim&quot; 
    Tuesday, March 7.</p>
  <p align="left"> &quot;The Zionist experiment has reached its inevitable conclusion. 
    Death tolls mount and no viable solution is in sight. Slowly the Jewish people 
    are awakening to the reality of Zionism, its rejection of Torah views of exile 
    and redemption, combined with its aggressive stance towards Gentiles in general 
    and Palestinians in particular.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The Rabbi explained, &quot;By burning the Israeli flag we are 
    symbolically declaring that the Israeli state, contrary to its absurd claims, 
    is not representative of the Jewish people. In fact, its denial of our faith 
    and its brutalization of the Palestinian people, renders it antithetical to 
    Judaism.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The timing of the flag burning is seen as particularly significant. 
    &quot;Tuesday is Purim, a holiday remembering the victory of faith over heresy 
    and good over evil, in ancient times. It is appropriate that we repudiate 
    the contemporary heresy and violence of Zionism on this day,&quot; Rabbi Weiss 
    added. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Zionism refuses to accept our status as people in exile. 
    This is metaphysical impudence. It is the task of world Jewry to remain patriotic 
    citizens of the lands of their dispersion and pursue peace with all people. 
    In the Holy Land, this means welcoming Palestinian sovereignty over the land. 
    Accordingly.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;The rejection of Zionism is the only path to peace. We 
    hope that many Jews will participate in this international event.&quot; <br>
