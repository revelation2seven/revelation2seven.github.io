<p><font size="+1">Two years ago we stood outside of Temple Emmanuel on the East 
  side of Manhatten, with our portable study board (or Kabbalah board as some 
  have called it) leaned up against the corner lamp post...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It was the beginning of the High Holy Days, Rosh Hashana, the 
  day of Blowing the Trumpets. The congregants were beginning to arrive for the 
  evening service. We had been there most of the day already hoping to speak to 
  as many as we could about the terrible things that were unfolding in the world 
  at that time, about the meaning of those things, indeed about the mystery of 
  the Hebrew Festivals themselves. (Ezekiel chapter 33 explains it quite well). 
  These were definetly <i>Days of Awe</i>. Limosines were arriving at the curb, 
  well-heeled people were coming from every direction. (It was like being at George 
  Bush's inauguration day in Washington more than a year later, on the day the 
  cattlemen, and the oil and timbermen came to town). There was a sense of self-certainty--of 
  self-importance--and purpose in everyone's steps as they greeted one another 
  at the door. Actually, and sadly enough, it was an air of indifference and unconcern 
  for Divine reality that we were sensing as they passed us by and filed into 
  the temple. Others began to mill around outside. There was expectation among 
  them. (There was also some visible concern about us). Shimon Perez and his entourage 
  of dignitaries from Israel were to arrive soon--but not before one of the temple 
  rabbis came out of the crowd to tell us that we were no longer permitted to 
  be standing where we were on this corner distracting the people, and that if 
  we did not leave he would have the police remove us.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">&quot;Are you sure you want us to leave?&quot; I asked. &quot;We 
  are not Christian missionaries trying to convert Jews. We are not trying to 
  divert anyone from their sacred observances, only to offer an interpretation 
  of them.&quot; Given the state of affairs in the Middle East at that time (even 
  before Ariel Sharon's famous walk around the temple mount, and now, of the tragic 
  events of this Passover season, 2002), it seemed that any new or different interpretation 
  of them would be welcome. The Scriptures were clear about it, great judgments 
  were preparing to unfold there in that part of the world. The world had not 
  learned the parable of the Fig Tree. (Matthew 24:32-34; Mth.21:19-21). The rabbi 
  told us that he was not really interested. &quot;Please,&quot; I said, &quot;please 
  consider these few things before we leave.&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; he 
  said, rolling his eyes, impatiently consenting. I tried to point out as much 
  as I could in the few moments that he was going to allot us. &quot;Please consider 
  the historical relationship between Passover and the High Holy Days&quot; I 
  asked him, pointing out the illustration on the plywood panels...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">&quot;Please see that as the Sun rises in the East at the time 
  of Passover, it does not remain there. (Malachi, chapter 4). It takes its course 
  to the West, to the end of the age and to the place of its own setting. It brings 
  those who have followed it at last to the realization that the New Moon of the 
  Seventh Month (Rosh Hashana) always appears in the West as well.&quot; We could 
  see that we would not be given enough time to explain the implications of this 
  mystery--the coming manifestation here in the West of the Messiahs on the Lunar, 
  Feminine, but also Jewish side of the Tree of Life. We implored him instead 
  to consider how the modern Zionist Movement went backwards, away from the Light

<p><font size="+1">This happened when the Jewish people, following the excitations 
  of Theodore Herzl and others, found their way out of Europe at the turn of the 
  twentieth century, back into a land that the God of Heaven went to all the trouble 
  of removing them from almost two thousand (or Forty Jubilees of) years ago. 
  And why would God have gone to all that trouble then? Because that land--that 
  <i>literal</i> piece of real estate in Palestine, that sliver of geography on 
  the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea--is <i>not</i> the <i>land</i> that 
  </font><font size="+1">God promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in ancient times. 
  <i>Oh that we were wise</i>, <i>that we understood this... </i>(Deuteronomy 
  32:29). And now the Lord of Heaven and Earth is having to rise up in the affairs 
  of humankind to do it all again. (Please open up the book of the Prophet Hosea, 
  and consider the 10th chapter of this work entitled <i>Ephraim Goes Backwards</i>).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Twice in history have the people of Israel committed this transgression, 
  the sin of <i>removing landmarks</i> and <i>going backward</i>. (It happened 
  over the course of the ten centuries leading up to the present common era, and 
  now, because of unbelief, it has happened again over the course of the 20th 
  century). Nevertheless, it says, <i>Speak comfortably unto my people</i>. (Isaiah 
  40:1,2). I tried to direct the rabbi's attention to the visage of the Great 
  Dragon, the countenance of the Leviathan. &quot;Look,&quot; I said, pointing 
  to the computer-enhanced photograph of Europe. It is like looking down from 
  heaven, directly on the mystery of Creation itself. &quot;Can you see it?&quot;

<p><font size="+1"> &quot;Please consider the implications?&quot; I asked. &quot;There's 
  an ancient Jewish city hidden there in the center of Europe (a Mystical City), 
  under present-day Vienna, Austria&quot; It is the place that the mind of Israel 
  came to in ancient times, following Jehoshua. (And the story of Jehoshua of 
  course was a foretype of those things that would come to pass again in the context 
  of the Christian mysteries thirteen hundred years later). Israel came up into 
  Europe in those ancient times under the collective name of Dan. <i>From Dan 
  to Be'er-sheba </i>was the mantra. I tried to direct him to the page from the

<p><font size="+1">These things should have immediately created a spark in his 
  uninquisitive mind. He wasn't interested. I am sure that he saw in us an fitting 
  example of those against whom the warning was made, against those who have been 
  carried away, not only in our times but since the beginning of this age, by 
  their own visions and imaginations. But these are dire times, Messianic times, 
  and one should be open to the message from God, from wherever it comes--even 
  if it comes from the most unlikely source. One should listen because at some 
  particular time in history (our own to be exact), the words will be fulfilled 
  which say: </font></p>
<blockquote>

<p><font size="+1">He told us again that we could not stand in front of his temple. 
  &quot;Go across the street, in front of the park&quot; he said. That was a way 
  of expiating his fascist and liberal tendencies at the same time. From over 
  there we could not interfere with the things that were going on in front of 
  Temple Emmanuel, not without appearing to be the kind of crazed fundamentalists 
  shouting at the top of their lungs that they were all so used to seeing. And 
  so we did. We stood across the street, silently reminding him as long as he 
  could see us, before the doors were shut and all the people were gone inside 
  to hear the Shofar, that he was now partly responsible for the fate of those 
  who would be caught in the crossfire of their own ignorance, and in the judgments 
  that were yet to unfold.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I came back the following year on the same day. I stood across 
  the street. This same rabbi saw me there and sent a police officer to stand 
  by me, to watch me, to make sure that I did not cause any trouble to his congregation. 
  The judgments were approaching. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Likewise, at several Israeli Day parades in a row, we have 
  been roundly ignored, scoffed at, lectured and preached to by proud young Zionists. 
  But mostly our sense of urgency about these matters was drowned out each year 
  by the festive atmosphere, the marching bands, the floats, the celebrities, 
  and the speeches. It is disheartening, actually surreal, to watch a people celebrating 
  their own imminent destruction as the Israelis have been doing on Fifth Avenue 
  year after year. Like their American Zionist counterparts in the West, (America 
  is also a Zionist state)...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Some years ago I taped a copy of this chart onto a storefront 
  window in Borough Park, to use it as a focus of conversation. The Hasidic owner 
  of the store screamed at me for desecrating his place of business. In Crown 
  Heights a couple of years ago a woman reported me to some Lubivitcher men, telling 
  them I was in the neighborhood trying to steal Jewish souls. They appeared to 
  tell me that if I did not get out of that area my books and other materials 
  would be destroyed. And this happened under a large sign that said &quot;Expect 
  Moshiac Soon.&quot; Outside of a <i>fabrengen </i>on Eastern Parkway some years 
  earlier a crowd of Jewish men surrounded me. I was trying to share the things 
  that were unfolding from the our studies in Kabbalah, about the Jewish state 
  and the coming of Messiah. &quot;Get out of here!&quot; they screamed, &quot;Go 
  tell it to Satmar.&quot; At Union Square one evening a very excitable woman 
  began to scream, &quot;He's one of those fanatical Satmars. He doesn't believe 
  the Jews have a right to exist.&quot; In Williamsburg I was simply, but politely, 
  ignored..... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have stood outside the doorway to the Jewish Press, hoping 
  for a chance to share these things with those who come in and out of there. 
  I had written them on several occasions, with no response. I was hoping that 
  if those who were so largely responsible for fomenting all of this religious 
  strife could only see, and perhaps discuss some of these things in a quiet atmosphere 
  of understanding and learning, it would open their eyes to the things that God 
  was bringing to pass in the earth, and particularly, for them and all their 
  readers, for the terrible things that God was bringing to pass in the Middle 
  East. But they are such children in spiritual matters. They think it is the 
  devil. They think it is the Muslims. They have no fear of God. They have forsaken 
  the words: <i>Behold, I send an Angel before thee...Beware of him, and obey 
  his voice. </i>(Exodus 23:20-23). The children of Israel have not obeyed. This 
  Angel is the Lord of History himself, the Lord of hosts, and He is risen up 
  everywhere in the earth now, preparing to bring this age of Darkness to its 
  own spiritual conclusion. The door stayed closed.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have spent many days in front of the Isaiah wall at the U.N. 
  It is as close as the police will allow one to get to those who meet inside 
  determining the fate of the world.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>None call for justice, nor any plead for truth: they trust 
    in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity...</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent 
    blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are 
    in their paths.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment 
    in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein 
    shall not know peace...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah 59:4-8)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And I have gotten as close as I could to those gatherings (those 
  frantic calls to further violence, to more bloodshed, and more destruction), 
  to the thousands and thousands who have appeared in front of the Israeli embassy 
  in New York City over the last few years shouting their defiant support of the 
  Zionist state. &quot;Death to the enemies of Israel!&quot; &quot;Down with the 
  Arabs!&quot; It is a very difficult thing to even suggest to those in such a 
  state of mind that the Jewish people, in essence, are but one of the figurative 
  Twelve Tribes of Israel, and that the true spiritual Nation of Israel is a much 
  higher and greater reality than Jews presently can imagine. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">At a demonstration last year in front of the Israeli embassy, 
  in support of the Zionist state, literally hundreds of angry and seething Jews 
  were railing against four courageous members of the Jewish <i>Neturei Karta. 
  </i>These most orthodox of Jews were behind a set of police barriers holding 
  up signs which said: &quot;Israel Out of Palestine.&quot; &quot;Give Palestine 
  Back to the Palestinians.&quot; Their absolutely perfect reasoning is rooted 
  in the realization that it is only with the coming of God's truly anointed ones 
  (the Messiahs), that the true, higher, spiritual nation of Israel can be established 
  in the earth. And these shall be revealed in the West not the East. Those who 
  have rejected the Law and the Prophets, whether they be Jew, Christian or Muslim, 
  can not imagine how all of these present events in the earth are leading up 
  to this reality. (Zechariah 4).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is equally difficult to suggest to Jews that those factions 
  of Islam which are rising up everywhere in the East against the presence of 
  the Zionist state are literally instruments in the Hands of God. <i>How else 
  shall HaShem judge the world? </i>Does not He, AllaH, have Islam bowing down 
  Five times a day, in absolute submission to His will? Is Islam free to violate 
  His dictates? Of course not. (Jews, of all people, have a terrible time understanding 
  the meaning of the <i>Shema</i>)...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>See now that I, even I, am He, and there is no God with 
    me: I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal: neither is there any that 
    can deliver out of my Hand...</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">If I whet my glittering sword, and mine Hand take hold 
    on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them 
    that hate me.</font></i></p>

    32:39-42)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">God has kept these powers in the earth to accomplish two ends: 
  judgment and perfection. Thus in the unfolding realities of our time (in the 
  judgments that are being exacted against all the nations of the earth), but 
  particularly in those events that are coming to pass right now in the Middle 
  East, God is judging Islam and Judaism together, and is purging them at the 
  same time from their literal and mutually violent states of mind. <i>O Israel,

  suggest to anyone among the Jews that just because the Jewish religion was set 
  aside at the beginning of this age to safeguard the written, or Literal Torah 
  (while its higher meanings unfolded Westward--as the age of Darkness and the 
  Mystery of Iniquity ran their present course), it is no indication, and it is 
  more obvious now than ever, that Judaism had any more access to the Torah's

  <p><b>In Germany, a rabbinical student was beaten up in downtown Berlin and

    Jewish cemetery of Kosice was invaded and 135 tombstones destroyed. </b></p>
  <p><b>But nowhere have the flames of anti-Semitism burned more furiously than 
    in France: In Lyon, a car was rammed into a synagogue and set on fire. In 
    Montpellier, the Jewish religious center was firebombed; so were synagogues 
    in Strasbourg and Marseilles; so was a Jewish school in Creteil. A Jewish 
    sports club in Toulouse was attacked with Molotov cocktails, and on the statue 
    of Alfred Dreyfus in Paris, the words &quot;Dirty Jew&quot; were painted. 
    In Bondy, 15 men beat up members of a Jewish football team with sticks and 
    metal bars. The bus that takes Jewish children to school in Aubervilliers 
    has been attacked three times in the last 14 months. According to the police, 
    metropolitan Paris has seen 10 to 12 anti-Jewish incidents per day since Easter. 
    Walls in Jewish neighborhoods have been defaced with slogans proclaiming &quot;Jews 
    to the gas chambers&quot; and &quot;Death to the Jews.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>The weekly journal Le Nouvel Observateur published an appalling libel: 
    It said Israeli soldiers rape Palestinian women, so that their relatives will 
    kill them to preserve &quot;family honor.&quot; The French ambassador to Great 
    Britain was not sacked -- and did not apologize -- when it was learned that 
    he had told guests at a London dinner that the world's troubles were the fault 
    of &quot;...that shitty little country, Israel.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;At the start of the 21st century,&quot; writes Pierre-Andre Taguieff, 
    a well-known social scientist, in a new book, &quot;we are discovering that 
    Jews are once again select targets of violence. . . Hatred of the Jews has 
    returned to France.&quot; But of course, it never left. Not France; not Europe. 
    Anti-Semitism, the oldest bigotry known, has been a part of European society 
    since time immemorial. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, open Jew-hatred 
    became unfashionable; but fashions change, and Europe is reverting to type. 
    To be sure, some Europeans are shocked by the reemergence of Jew-hatred all 
    over their continent. But the more common reaction has been complacency. </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Stop saying that there is anti-Semitism in France,&quot; President 
    Jacques Chirac scolded a Jewish editor in January. &quot;There is no anti-Semitism 
    in France.&quot; The European media have been vicious in condemning Israel's 
    self-defense against Palestinian terrorism in the West Bank; they have been 
    far less agitated about antiJewish terror in their own backyard. They are 
    making a grievous mistake. For if today the violence and vitriol are aimed 
    at the Jews, tomorrow they will be aimed at the Christians. A timeless lesson 
    of history is that it rarely ends with the Jews. </b></p>
  <p><b>Militant Islamist extremists were attacking and killing Jews long before 
    they attacked and killed Americans on Sept. 11. The Nazis first set out to 
    incinerate the Jews; in the end, all of Europe was ablaze. Jews, it is often 
    said, are the canary in the coal mine of civilization. When they become the 
    objects of savagery and hate, it means the air has been poisoned and an explosion 
    is soon to come. If Europeans don't rise up and turn against the Jew-haters, 
    it is only a matter of time until the Jew-haters rise up and turn against 
    them. French Anti-Semitism: &quot;Finally and long overdue, your people, oppressed 
    and disgraced by hatred and maliciousness, have achieved justice: now you 
    enjoy full citizen's rights, but you'll remain Jews nonetheless.&quot; Franz 
    Grillparzer (1791-1872), Austrian author. </b></p>
  <p><b>According to the Anti-Defamation League, from September 9, 2000, at the 
    start of the intifada, through November 20, 2001, there were some 330 acts 
    of anti-Semitism just in and around Paris. In addition to literally scores 
    of firebombing of synagogues, just before Rosh Hashanah, 200 Arabs attacked 
    Jews on the Champs Elysees. The pace has only picked up since then: In December, 
    a French cinema in Paris refused to allow a Hanukah showing of Harry Potter 
    to 800 Jewish children because of French-Palestinian threats (the threats 
    were confirmed by French police who then went on to do nothing, not even giving 
    details). It was one incident in an eventful month when synagogues continued 
    to be firebombed and a Jewish kindergarten was vandalized with anti-Semitic 
    graffiti and set ablaze. </b></p>
  <p><b>We can understand anti-Semitism among the French people. There is nothing 
    the French love like their traditions and, on the question of hating Jews, 
    they certainly have tradition galore. What, however, can explain the sometimes 
    muted, sometimes defensively outraged reaction of French officials? Simple. 
    There are approximately 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 Muslims presently living in 
    France and many more arrive daily. There are only about 600,000 Jews still 
    living in France. Moreover, France is the number one European exporter to 
    Iraq, totaling over two billion dollars per year in exports since 2000. To 
    those who are at a loss to explain why French elected officials seem &quot;helpless&quot; 
    to stem the tide of anti-Semitism, something smells awfully Vichy around here.

  <p><b>Israel is at war against a fearsome enemy which has brought the fight 
    to its streets. Much of the civilized world (well, at least on this side of 
    the Atlantic), finally understands this fact. What is not being acknowledged, 
    however, is that this is not a war against Israel, or as propagandists and 
    demagogues worldwide would have it, occupiers. This is a war against each 
    and every individual, Israeli or not, religious or not, Zionist or not, right, 
    left or center, who identifies himself or herself as Jewish or could be thought 
    of my others as Jewish--i.e., those of us who may have Jewish families or 
    ancestry but do not practice Judaism. </b></p>
  <p><b>Israel is only the publicized front line and if you are not in Israel, 
    and the fight has not arrived at your front yard, just wait. Or, perhaps, 
    we shouldn't wait. Perhaps history has finally taught us, of all people, that 
    waiting and hoping for succor and sympathy from the nations of the world will 
    lead only to more burned synagogues, pogroms, and, down the road, grim-faced 
    dignitaries mouthing &quot;never again&quot; while dedicating yet another 
    memorial museum. </b></p>
  <p><b>We cannot wait inactively and hope to have security or peace for our children 
    or ourselves. We dare not privately rail against irrational, virulent hatred 
    while letting the world believe that we remain disinterested, accepting our 
    lot with equanimity or, worse, resignation. We can and must do more than simply 
    grieve. Do, at least, these three simple things: </b></p>
  <p><b>1) care enough to stay informed. Don't ever let yourself become deluded 
    into thinking that this is not your fight. </b></p>
  <p><b>2) boycott France. Only the Arab countries are more toxically anti-Semitic 
    and, unlike them, France exports more than just oil and hatred. So boycott 
    their wines and their perfumes. Boycott their clothes and their foodstuffs. 
    Boycott their movies. Definitely boycott their shores. If we are resolved 
    we can exert amazing pressure and, whatever else we may know about the French, 
    we most certainly know that they are as a cobweb in a hurricane in the face 
    of well directed pressure. </b></p>
  <p><b>3) send this along to your family, your friends, and your coworkers. Think

  THE STATE OF ISRAEL HAS DECLARED ALL-OUT WAR ON THE JEWISH PEOPLE WORLDWIDE 
</p>
<p>Ariel Sharon, the Prime Minister of Israel told the crowd at a Rome hotel. 
  &quot;We are witness to a great wave of anti-Semitism, and apart from the usual 
  anti-Semitism against Jews, there is today the added hate of the collective 
  Jew, which is Israel.&#148;&#133; &#147;The best solution to anti-Semitism is 
  immigration to Israel. It is the only place on Earth where Jews can live as 
  Jews,&quot; he said. (BBC website of Monday, 17 November, 2003 (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3275979.stm)<br>
  <br>
  Mr. Sharon has moved from the planning stages as stated in November, 2003, to 
  the execution of the plan which has been in development since the days of Herzl, 
  the founder of the Zionist movement, who stated in his diary &#147;It is essential 
  that the sufferings of Jews. . . become worse. . . this will assist in realization 
  of our plans. . .I have an excellent idea. . . I shall induce anti-Semites to 
  liquidate Jewish wealth. . . The anti-Semites will assist us thereby in that 
  they will strengthen the persecution and oppression of Jews. The anti-Semites 
  shall be our best friends&#148;. (From his Diary, Part I, pp. 16)</p>
<p>In executing this plan they have successfully escalated anti-Semitism throughout 
  the world. There is great pain that the press and politicians are calling the 
  actions of the Zionist movement &#147;Jewish actions.&#148; With these words 
  they are helping the Zionists to fulfill their dreams. We call upon the world 
  again to understand that the state of &#147;Israel&#148; does not represent 
  the Jewish faith and traditions and that Zionists are the greatest enemies to 
  the Jewish people.</p>
<p>We appeal to people of good will in the media itself to open their minds and 
  hearts to what we are proclaiming about the truth of Judaism, which has been 
  distorted by the Zionists.<br>
  <br>
  The promises of the Torah are always to be realized. This verse from the Torah 
  demonstrates that those who are his enemies will pay a price when The kingdom 
  of G-D will prevail.<br>
  <br>

  of his servants. He will render vengeance against his adversaries and make expiation 
  for his land and his People. <br>

  Rabbi Weiss Rips Ariel Sharon &amp; Zionism <br>
  By William Hughes<br>
  4-18-4<br>
</p>
<p> Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss&quot;... it creates anti-Semitism. And we know that 
  for close to 100 years already, Zionism is <br>
  the root cause for the pain, suffering and bloodshed of the Jewish people&quot;<br>
  <br>
  On April 14, 2004, Israel's Ariel Sharon met in the White House, in Washington, 
  DC, with President George W. Bush, Jr. They were consummating a deal that James 
  J. Zogby has rightly denounced as &quot;a unilaterally imposed solution to the 
  Israeli-Palestinian conflict (&quot;Sharon's Awful Victory,&quot; 04/18, 04, 
  &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;). The agreement involves, inter alia, the future of 
  the Occupied Territories and the right of return to their homeland of millions 
  of Palestinian refugees. <br>
</p>
<p>While the dangerous duo were inside undermining the fundamental rights of the 
  Palestinian people, and International Law, too, over 100 protesters gathered 
  outside, just north of Lafayette Park, a block from the White House, to demonstrate 
  their outrage over the meeting. The rally was spearheaded by the DC Palestine 
  Solidarity Coalition, which represents 12 activist organizations in the Washington-Maryland-Virginia 
  area. One of the groups protesting was a contingent of Orthodox Rabbis, &quot;Neturei 
  Karta International,&quot; from Monsey, New York (www.nkusa.org). Under their 
  banner of &quot;Jews United Against Zionism,&quot; about seven of the Rabbis 
  joined the picket line along 16th St. and H St. (NW), as a cold rain fell for 
  over two hours on those bearing witness against the evil doings then being hatched 
  by Bush and Sharon. Many of the demonstrators were convinced that Sharon, instead 
  of being an honored guest of Bush, should instead be a defendant, at the World 
  Court, facing War Crime charges (&quot;Human Rights News,&quot; 06/23/01, hrw.org). 
  <br>
</p>
<p>I had a chance, at the event, to speak with the highly respected leader of 
  Neturei Karta International, Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss. He was standing on H 
  St. protesting with a sign hanging over his neck, which read, &quot;Authentic 
  Rabbis Always Opposed Zionism.&quot; When I asked the Rabbi why he was there, 
  he said, &quot;Sharon, who came today to speak with President Bush, is not the 
  representative of Judaism or the Jewish people. In fact, he is the antitheses 
  of what a representative of the Jew should be.&quot; <br>
  Rabbi Weiss then put some historical context on his comment and explained how 
  the Zionism Movement, a political juggernaut, with only materialist objectives, 
  has hijacked Judaism, the religion of the Jewish people. He continued, &quot;Because, 
  when God sent the Jewish people into exile around 2,000 years ago, he expressly 
  forbade us from creating our own state. So, the concept of creating a state 
  of Israel is wrong. It is against what God wanted of the Jewish people. We are 
  in a divinely-decreed exile to be spread out amongst the nations - to serve 
  them and to be a light unto the nations, and not to return till ultimately when 
  God will accept the repentance of the Jewish people. At that time, the whole 
  world, we believe, will recognize the one God and serve him together in harmony. 
  So, we will not be using any force or military action. At that time, the whole 
  world will go up and serve God. <br>
</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Zionism was created around 100 years ago by non-religious Jews, 
  who ignored the commandments of God. They actually tried to claim that the reason 
  we were sent out of the land of Israel around 2,000 years ago was because of 
  our physical weak (ness). And, that is a fallacy. And, therefore, their solution 
  is, if it is physical weakness - the solution would obviously be, to be physically 
  strong - to create a state. That is wrong. That is a blasphemy. And, we are 
  taught in the Talmud that God will severely punish the Jewish people, if they 
  will try to return against his will.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>On Rabbi Weiss' web site at: www.nkusa.org, part of the above point is further 
  explained like this: &quot;Judaism is the belief in revelation at Sinai. Exile 
  is a punishment for Jewish sins. Zionism has for over a century denied Sinai 
  revelation. It believes that Jewish exile can be ended by military aggression.&quot; 
  Rabbi Weiss then addressed the barbaric treatment of the Palestinian people 
  by the Zionists, going back to 1948. It has included: Israel running death squads; 
  torturing detainees, holding prisoners without trial; creating a monstrous Apartheid 
  Wall; erecting arbitrary roadblocks; perpetrating land confiscation; demolishing 
  homes; collective punishment; building illegal settlements; and engaging, via 
  state terrorism tactics, in ethnic cleansing (See, &quot;Washington Report on 
  Middle East Affairs,&quot; wrema.com). <br>
</p>
<p>&quot;Now, another of the problems that emanate actually from the Zionist Movement,&quot; 
  the Rabbi underscored,&quot; is the fact that they are encroaching upon the 
  rights of the Palestinian people, the indigenous people, who are living there. 
  And, this is terribly wrong. It is against every concept of the Torah: Thou 
  shalt not steal and so forth; Thou shalt not oppress a people. It is all against 
  the commandments of the Torah, of being compassionate; of what a Jewish person; 
  and what every righteous person should emulate God. So, whatever they are doing 
  is totally wrong! &quot;And, it creates anti-Semitism. And we know that for 
  close to 100 years already, Zionism is the root cause for the pain, suffering 
  and bloodshed of the Jewish people, let alone who is talking about the Palestinian 
  people and what has been going on in Palestine. And they, (the Zionists), are 
  the greatest factory of anti-Semitism worldwide. So, that is what we are here 
  for, to let the world know that Judaism and Zionism is not one and the same. 
  They are diametrically opposite. And, we should not be mistaken one for the 
  other. And, we shouldn't be responsible for the actions of what the Zionists 
  do,&quot; Rabbi Weiss emphasized... <br>
</p>
<p>. Rabbi Weiss finished his remarks by explaining why his group publicly opposes 
  Zionism: &quot;And we hope... to sort of quell God's wrath towards the Jewish 
  people, to sanctify God's name, which the Zionists are desecrating, and to take 
  away the anti-Semitism, the bad feelings, the rift that has been created between 
  Jews and Muslims throughout the world.&quot; <br>

  The Zionist Independence Day Is A Day Of Mourning And Fasting For Jews Untainted 
  By Zionist Heresy<br>
  April 26, 2004<br>
</p>
<p>All Jews untainted by Zionist heresy experience the bitter realization of how 
  the Zionist heretics worked relentlessly throughout the years to uproot the 
  Jewish People from their religious faith, and even to bring about untold physical 
  suffering through the prohibited provocations against the nations. The Zionists 
  have been the ones who have enflamed the fire of hostility against the Jewish 
  People in ways to numerous to enumerate. </p>
<p>It is for this reason that many great rabbis called on faithful Jews to fast 
  on the Zionist Independence Day, and to beseech G-d Alm-ghty to have mercy and 
  grant peace to those people living under the Zionist regime. </p>
<p>The late Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum of Satmar (1890-1979) wrote that in previous 
  generations great rabbis would have declared an obligatory worldwide fast day 
  for such a dark day as the Zionist Independence Day, the basis of which is every 
  sin in the world, especially bloodshed and promiscuity. He even said that such 
  rabbis of the greater previous generations would have declared hundreds of days 
  of fasting such as the Ninth of the Month of Av (commemorating the destruction 
  of the ancient Temple in Jerusalem). He also stated that G-d rejects the religious 
  holiday observances of anyone observing the Zionist holiday. The sources for 
  his inspirational statements in Hebrew can be found in many places among his 
  writings such as Hiddushei Torah, 1955/56, p, 52; ibid., p. 109; ibid., Sukkoth, 
  p. 110. </p>
<p>In recognition of this bitter day on which so many others celebrate the creation 
  of this vile Zionist regime in 1948, a number of speakers will give lectures 
  in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. </p>
<p>Rabbi Menashe Fillip will speak on Sunday evening at the Satmar Yetev Lev Synagogue, 
  152 Rodney Street, Brooklyn, NY at 9:30 as he has for many years against the 
  abominable rebellion against our religion and Torah known as the State of &#147;Israel.&#148; 
</p>
<p>Monday evening, April 26 there will be an assembly of people at the Nesivos 
  Olam Synagogue, 205 Hewes St., Brooklyn, NY at 6 pm to recite Psalms and to 
  pray that the world will understand the difference between Zionism and Judaism 
  and that all Jews are not Zionists.</p>
<p>The following rabbis will speak to those assembled during the evening : </p>
<p>Rabbi Meir Weberman, the officiating rabbi at the Nesivos Olam Synagogue congregation, 
  <br>
  Rabbi Avraham Leitner<br>
  Rabbi Todros Silber<br>

<p>Declaration on &#145;Zionism and the State of Israel&#146; from Neturei Karta 
  on behalf of Torah true Jews to the Palestinian People and the Arab and Muslim 
  world </p>
<p>A statement delivered by Rabbi Yisroel D. Weiss of Neturei Karta Int. at a 
  rally in Times Square &lt;http://www.nkusa.org/activities/Demonstrations/Al-Nakba04.cfm&gt; 
  , New York City on May 14, 2004, organized by many major American-Muslim organizations 
  in commemoration of Al-Nakba Day (The day of the creation of the 'State' of 
  Israel)<br>
  Rabbi Yisroel Weiss</p>
<p>Torah true Jews mourn the fifty six years of the illegitimate State of Israel 
  in Palestine and express their solidarity and deep sympathy with the Palestinian 
  People in their suffering and struggle against the Zionist oppression. The practical 
  outcome of Zionism in the form of the State known as &#145;Israel&#146;, is 
  completely alien to Judaism and the Jewish Faith and has been and continues 
  to be the cause of untold suffering and bloodshed both Jewish and non-Jewish.</p>
<p>With a continuing chain of events over more than half a century, ranging from 
  the withholding of the &#145;right of return&#146; from the Palestinian refugees 
  and leading currently to such issues as the &#145;wall&#146; and &#145;extra 
  judicial assassinations&#146;, Zionism has proven to be one of the greatest 
  desecrations of God&#146;s name and the Jewish religion. The Jewish Religion 
  is a spiritual belief handed down through the generations for thousands of years. 
  It is a basic part of the Jewish belief, to accept willingly, the Heavenly decree 
  of exile affecting the Jewish People and not to try and fight against it or 
  to end it by our own hands.</p>
<p>In practical terms, exile for us means that Jews must be loyal subjects of 
  the countries in which they live and not attempt to rule over the established 
  indigenous populations of those countries. The Torah certainly forbids us to 
  form a State of our own. This applies whether in the world at large or in Palestine. 
  The Zionist movement, however, which was founded approximately 100 years ago 
  based on secular nationalistic aims, was a complete abandonment of our religious 
  teachings and faith in general, and in particular an abandonment of our approach 
  to our state of exile and to the peoples among whom we live.</p>
<p>The ideology of Zionism is secular and atheistic and advocates taking the law 
  into ones own hands by trying to force the outcome in the form of a State. Irrespective 
  of the cost in life and property to anyone who stands in the way. The Zionist 
  ideology is the antithesis of Jewish religious values and is an embarrassment 
  and a disgrace to the Jewish People.</p>
<p>One must add to the wrongs of Zionism and the state of &#147;Israel&#148;, 
  the fact, that in order to achieve an ill conceived nationalistic ambition, 
  a shocking contravention of the Jewish Religious values of natural and humanitarian 
  justice was committed, in setting up an illegitimate sectarian regime in Palestine, 
  completely against the wishes and over the heads of the established population, 
  the Palestinians, both Arab and God fearing Jew. This inevitably had to be based 
  on illegal confiscation of property and loss of life. According to the Torah 
  and Jewish faith, the present Palestinian, Arab claim to rule in Palestine is 
  right and just. The Zionist claim is wrong and criminal.<br>
</p>
<p>Our attitude to the &#145;State of Israel&#146; is that the whole concept is 
  flawed and illegitimate. It is a tragedy for the Palestinians and also for the 
  Jewish people. Furthermore, the Zionists have made themselves to appear as the 
  representatives and spokespeople of all Jews, thus, with their actions, arousing 
  animosity against the Jews. But, their claim is simply not true! Zionism is 
  not Judaism. Zionists cannot speak in the name of Jews. </p>
<p>Finally, we stress that the connection between Arab and Jew goes right back 
  into ancient history. Mostly the relationship was friendly and mutually beneficial. 
  Historically, the situation frequently was that when Jews were being persecuted 
  in Europe they found refuge in the various Arab and Muslim countries. Our attitude 
  to Muslims and Arabs can only be one of friendliness and respect.</p>
<p>We are awaiting the annulment of Zionism and the peaceful, speedy, dismantling 
  of the State of Israel, and would welcome the opportunity to dwell in peace 
  in the holy land under Palestinian rule. ULTIMATELY WE AWAIT THE REVELATION 
  OF GOD'S GLORY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, when all mankind will recognize the one 
  God and serve Him together in harmony and happiness. AMEN</p>

<p align="center">Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated On The Jewish People <br>
  Zionism And Anti-Semitism<br>
  Jews Against Zionism<br>
  7-19-4 </p>
<p align="left">We implore and beseech our Jewish brethren to realize that the 
  Zionists are not the saviors of the Jewish People and guarantors of their safety, 
  but rather the instigators and original cause of Jewish suffering in the Holy 
  Land and worldwide. The idea that Zionism and the State of &quot;Israel is the 
  protector of Jews is probably the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the Jewish 
  People. Indeed, where else since 1945 have Jews been in such physical danger 
  as in the Zionist state?! <br>
</p>
<p align="left">Jews are enjoined by their religious laws to be loyal to the country 
  of which they are citizens. ever since the destruction of the holy Temple in 
  Jerusalem and the exile of the Jewish People some two thousand years ago, we 
  have been enjoined to be scrupulously loyal to the countries we reside in, One 
  of the great biblical prophets, Jeremiah, in chapter 29 of his book proclaimed 
  G-d's message to all the exiled; verse seven reads, &quot;Seek out the welfare 
  of the city to which I have exiled you and pray for it to the Almighty, for 
  through its welfare will you have welfare.&quot; This has been a cornerstone 
  of Jewish morality throughout our history to this very day. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">Torah-true Jews wish to live in peace and harmony with their neighbors 
  in every country among the community of nations, including in historic Palestine. 
  They deplore acts and policies of violence carried out by those who, misusing 
  the name of Israel our forefather, have substituted the ideal of chauvinist 
  nationalism for the eternal values of the Torah, the eternal divinely bestowed 
  inheritance of the Jewish people. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">It has been the age-old intention of Zionism to intentionally 
  stir up anti-Semitism anywhere possible, and even more commonly, to take advantage 
  of any Jewish suffering anywhere in order to enhance its cause Indeed, hatred 
  of Jews and Jewish suffering is the oxygen of the Zionist movement, and from 
  the very beginning has been to deliberately incite hatred of the Jew and then, 
  in feigned horror, use it to justify the existence of the Zionist state this 
  is, of course, Machiavellianism raised to the highest degree. Thus, the Zionists 
  thrive on hatred and suffering of Jews, and seek to benefit thereby through 
  keeping Jews in perpetual fear, causing them to ignore the true nature of Zionism, 
  and instead to consider the Zionist state is their salvation. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">ANTI-SEMITISM BY POLITICAL ZIONISM <br>
</p>
<p align="left">Although Zionists and others dispute it, the undeniable fact is 
  that revolutionary secular and apostate elements in the Jewish community in 
  Europe contributed greatly to hostility towards Jews after World War I. This 
  aroused hatred of Jews in general among many non-Jews. While a prisoner in 1924 
  in the fortress of Lansberg on the River Lech, Hitler wrote his Mein Kampf. 
  We he became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he was assisted by Goebbels, Roseberg 
  and Streicher. From them came the declarations, &quot;The Jews of Germany caused 
  the defeat of Germany in the 1914-1918 war; the Jews of Germany were responsible 
  for the terrible conditions in Germany that followed the war; the Jews of Germany 
  are foreigners and they wish to remain foreigners; they have no loyalty to the 
  country of their birth; they are not human; they are filthy dogs; they have 
  no right to intrude into Germany,s affairs; there are too many Jews in Germany. 
  <br>
</p>
<p align="left">As far as Zionism is concerned, the founder of Zionism and apostate, 
  Theodor Herzl, sought to intensify hatred of the Jew in order to enhance the 
  cause of political Zionism. Here are some of his &quot;pearls: &quot;It is essential 
  that the sufferings of Jews. . . become worse. . . this will assist in realization 
  of our plans. . .I have an excellent idea. . . I shall induce anti-semites to 
  liquidate Jewish wealth. . . The anti-semites will assist us thereby in that 
  they will strengthen the persecution and oppression of Jews. The anti-semites 
  shall be our best friends. (From his Diary, Part I, pp. 16) <br>
</p>
<p align="left">Additional words from the vivid imagination of this dreamer, from 
  p. 68 of Part I of his Diary. So anti-Semitism, which is a deeply imbedded force 
  in the subconscious mind of the masses, will not harm the Jews. I actually find 
  it to be advantageous to building the Jewish character, education by the masses 
  that will lead to assimilation. This education can only happen through suffering, 
  and the Jews will adapt. Hateful views of Jews as being subhuman did not have 
  to be invented by Nazi theorists such as Hitler, Goebbels, Rosenberg and Streicher. 
  This ideology was simply adapted from statements of political Zionists such 
  as those found in the writings of the Zionist Yehezkel Kaufman in 1933. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">In 1920 there were statements hostile to Jews expressed at Heidelberg 
  University. These statements, arguing that Jews of Germany had caused the turmoil 
  that followed the war; that the Jews of Germany had nothing in common with Germans, 
  and that Germans had the right to prevent the Jews of Germany from intruding 
  into the affairs of their volk were not made by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf, 
  but by Nahum Goldmann, who went in to become the President of the World Zionist 
  Organization and head of the World Jewish Congress, and, indisputably, the most 
  influential political Zionist in the world, second only to the Prime Minister 
  of the State of Israel. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">In 1921, Germans in Germany were told that: &quot;We Jews are 
  aliens a foreign people in your midst and we wish to stay that way. A Jew can 
  never be a loyal German; whoever calls the foreign land his Fatherland is a 
  traitor to the Jewish people&quot;. Who spoke these vile words? It was Jacob 
  Klatzkin, the second of two political Zionist ideologists in Germany at the 
  time, where the Jews of Germany were enjoying full political and civil rights. 
  It was he who had advocated undermining Jewish communities as the one certain 
  way of acquiring a state. &quot;They had no qualms concerning tearing down the 
  existing Jewish communities. Who spoke in a public address at a political Zionist 
  meeting in Berlin and declared that &quot;Germany has too many Jews? Was it 
  Hitler or Goebbels? No, it was Chaim Weizman, later to become the first President 
  of the State of Israel. This address was published in 1920, and, thus, four 
  years before Hitler had even written Mein Kampf. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">How many Zionist Jews know of this vicious treachery uttered by 
  these senior political Zionist leaders, these apostates from the Jewish People? 
  At the Nuremberg Trials of Major War Criminals, Nazi propagandist, Julius Streicher 
  testified: &quot;I did no more than echo what the leading Zionists had been 
  saying, it is clear that he had told the truth. In addition to Hitler, Rosenberg, 
  Goebbels and Streicher, many other Nazi leaders used statements from Zionists 
  to validate their charges against the Jews of Germany. Such are the efforts 
  of Zionist leaders to this very day to maintain a high degree of anti-semitism 
  in order to enable them, in feigned horror, to then point to anti-semitism to 
  support their idolatrous and anti-Jewish cause. In 1963, Moshe Sharett, then 
  Chairman of the Jewish Agency, told the 38th Annual Congress of the Scandinavian 
  Youth Federation that the freedom enjoyed by the majority of Jews imperiled 
  Zionism, and at the 26th World Zionist Congress, the delegates were told that 
  the Jew is endangered by the easing of anti-Semitism in the United States &quot;We 
  are endangered by freedom he declared. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">As we stated earlier, Zionism thrives on anti-Semitism. Ben Gurion 
  declared, &quot;not always and not everywhere do I opposed anti-Semitism. Zionists 
  regularly pull out their handy &quot;anti-Semite race card against anyone, Jew 
  or non-Jew, who dares to speak out against the wickedness of Zionism. During 
  World War II, the Lehi organization, an offshoot of Begin,s Irgun that was headed 
  by Yitzchak Shamir sought an alliance with Nazis! The following is a quote from 
  the writings of the Lehi in their contact with the Nazis: <br>
</p>
<p align="left">&quot;The establishment of the historical Jewish state on a national 
  and totalitarian basis and bound by a treaty with the German Reich would be 
  in the interests of strengthening the future German position of power in the 
  Near East ... The NMO in Palestine offers to take an active part in the war 
  on Germany's side ... The cooperation of the Israeli freedom movement would 
  also be in line with one of the recent speeches of the German Reich Chancellor, 
  in which Herr Hitler stressed that any combination and any alliance would be 
  entered into in order to isolate England and defeat it.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p align="left">To those who assume that Zionists have been on the side of freedom 
  and equality, these words seem strange. However, to those who understand the 
  root of Zionism, which is the transformation and eradication of the concept 
  of the traditional Jew and Judaism, these statements are not strange at all. 
  They are to be expected. The Zionists agreed with Nazism in general, even prior 
  to the advent of Nazism. They believed that Jews could not, and should not, 
  live in harmony in any other society in the world, and that should be removed 
  from those societies for the benefit of those societies. They believed that 
  the new Jewish existence in its own State would remake the image of Jews as 
  &quot;useless and &quot;parasites. These ideas existed long before Adolf Hitler! 
  <br>
</p>
<p align="left">There is a huge amount of literature describing how the Zionists 
  made it very difficult to save Jews during and after World War II. As various 
  individuals and organizations were trying to arrange departures of Jews to western 
  countries, the Zionists worked overtime to prevent this from happening. They 
  expressed the opinion that building up the Jewish population of Palestine was 
  more important than enabling Jews to go to third countries, and they insisted 
  to western powers that Jews should not be accepted anywhere other than Palestine. 
  Indeed, Yitzchak Greenbaum, a famous Zionist, proclaimed that &quot;one cow 
  in Palestine was worth more than all the Jews in Poland. The infamous David 
  Ben-Gurion said in 1938: &quot;If I knew it was possible to save all the children 
  in Germany by taking them to England, and only half of the children by taking 
  them to Eretz Israel, I would choose the second solution. For we must take into 
  account not only the lives of these children but also the history of the people 
  of Israel.&quot; <br>

</p>
<p align="left">After the war, a Zionist 'religious' leader, Rabbi Klaussner, 
  who was in charge of displaced persons presented a report before the Jewish 
  American Conference on May 2nd, 1948 : &quot;I am convinced people must be forced 
  to go to Palestine...For them, an American dollar appears as the highest of 
  goals. By the word &quot;force&quot;, I am suggesting a programme. It served 
  for the evacuation of the Jews in Poland, and in the history of the 'Exodus'... 
  To apply this programme we must, instead of providing 'displaced persons' with 
  comfort, create the greatest possible discomfort for them...At a second stage, 
  a procedure calling upon the Haganah to harass the Jews.&quot; It is ironic 
  that the Zionists proclaim their State as the safe haven for the Jewish People, 
  when since World War II no place on earth has been as dangerous for Jews, both 
  spiritually and physically, as the Zionist state. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">The Zionists worked relentlessly to create fear among Jews in 
  the Arab countries after the Zionist state was established. Their tactic work 
  most successfully in Yemen, Morocco, Iraq, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia. It is common 
  knowledge among Iraqi Jews that during 1949-1950 the famous Zionist, Mordechai 
  ben Porat, who had the nickname of Morad Abu al-Knabel (Mordechai Bomber), was 
  instrumental in seeking to bribe Iraqi officials after the creation of the Zionist 
  state to pass laws to encourage Jews to leave Iraq. This was enhanced by the 
  Zionists planting bombs in synagogues in Baghdad in March 1950. Information 
  about this is readily available on the internet. For more information Click 
  Here. http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/onlinebooks/IraqiJews1.htm <br>
</p>
<p align="left">The writings of Mr. Naim Giladi document in detail what the Zionists 
  did in Baghdad in 1950 to provoke the departure of the Jews to the Zionist state. 
  The Zionists do not care what effect their policies have on the Jewish communities 
  of any country. When they accuse European nations of every sin under the sun, 
  do the Zionists care that this will produce hostility towards Jews? No! Not 
  a bit. On the contrary, as we have discussed, they thrive on such circumstances, 
  clinging to the vain hope that these Jewish communities will rush for the &quot;salvation 
  of the &quot;safe haven of the Zionist Paradise where Jews are in constant danger 
  as the Zionist regime undertakes every form of cruel provocation against non-Jews. 
  <br>
</p>
<p align="left">In more recent times the Zionists have sought every opportunity 
  to encourage Jews to leave their home countries. Anytime there is even the smallest 
  event of hostility toward Jews on the heels of Zionist policy, or if there are 
  signs of economic distress and dislocation, the Zionists magnify it a thousand 
  times, seek to ruthlessly humiliate the nations involved, and agitate for Jews 
  to go to the Zionist state, the so-called &quot;natural home of the Jewish People. 
  This has been the case in countries such as France, Argentina, Uruguay, the 
  former Soviet Union and Egypt. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">The promises of the Torah are always to be realized. This verse 
  from the Torah demonstrates that those who are his enemies will pay a price 
  when The kingdom of G-D will prevail. Deuteronomy 32:43: Praise his People, 
  O Nations: For he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will render vengeance 
  against his adversaries and make expiation for his land and his People. <br>
