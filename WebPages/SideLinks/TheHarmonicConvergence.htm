<p align="center">By Bob Sipchen and Jonathan Weisman</p>
<p>CHACO CANYON, N.M.___Roberleigh Haig ran her finger around the edge of a luminescent 
  bowl made of laser-fused ground crystal, filling the great kiva of the ancient 
  Anasazi Indians with an otherworldly wail.</p>
<p>A week ago, Haig, her mother and their white Afghan had hopped into Haig's 
  new Mercedes--license plate BELIEVE--and driven from Palm Springs, Calif. to 
  this remote desert site. Here they now camp with a couple dozen other pilgrims 
  awaiting the dawn of the new age.</p>
<p>On Aug.16, hundreds, or thousands of people (144,000) by some theorists' reckoning) 
  will gather at Chaco Canyon and other &quot;sacred sites&quot; around the world 
  to help kick off a mysterious event true believers call the Harmonic Convergence.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/chacocanyon.gif" width="525" height="300"></p>
<p>Whatever happens that day, the word is out. An unenlightened character in the 
  Doonesbury comic strip refers to the projected event as the &quot;moronic convergence...sort 
  of a national fruit loops day, lots of wind chimes,&quot; Loyd Selden, a Southern 
  California Topanga writer and printer who has been in Santa Fe working on the 
  logistics of the Chaco Canyon gathering prefers to think of it as &quot;the 
  spiritual Woodstock.&quot;</p>
<p>For several months now, word of the gathering has been spreading through the 
  amorphous international community of New Age believers. Some people say they 
  learned of the event through visions, dreams, or channeling.</p>
<p>In this dimension, though, the threads of information about harmonic convergence 
  usually leads to a 48-year old author by the name of Jose Arguelles, who in 
  1983 had a vision of his own: At sunrise on Aug. 16, 1987, people around the 
  world would participate in &quot;ritualistic surrender to the earth.&quot;</p>
<p>By early 1987, he'd fleshed that vision out in the Mayan Factor,&quot; a book 
  in which Arguelles revealed his interpretation of the Mayan calendar, the timekeeping 
  mechanism developed by the Indian civilization that thrived in Mexico, Guatemala, 
  and Belize from AD 300 to 900.</p>
<p>(Calculating the 52-year segments of the Mayan calendar)...The Maya designated 
  3114 BC as the beginning of the &quot;Mayan era,&quot; which ends its &quot;great 
  cycle&quot; in the year 2012 AD.</p>
<p>As Arguelles interprets it, however, the calendar also reveals that Earth will 
  pass out of the &quot;galactic beam&quot; in which he says it has been immersed 
  since the Mayan era began and will enter in 2012 &quot;a galactic synchronization&quot; 
  phase.</p>
<p>This watershed was also prophesied by the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, a feathered 
  serpent who is scheduled to arrive on earth at the end of the Aztec calendar, 
  which Arguelles contends ends this weekend (on the Day 1-Reed in the year 1-Reed)...</p>
<p>Arguelles believes Aug. 16-17 marks the moment the &quot;wave&quot; of history 
  that gave us civilization peaks. From then on a &quot;new galactic type of energy&quot; 
  will resonate through the earth and galaxy, carrying mankind to 2012 when the 
  New Age begins in earnest.</p>
<p>Followers of this thinking say mathematical equations show that at least 144,000 
  &quot;self-selected&quot; people will have to participate to send that vision 
  spontaneously sparking through the imaginations of the majority of humanity. 
  By dancing, meditating, chanting, or--as Arguelles would put it--simply &quot;showing 
  their integrity,&quot; 144,000 people with &quot;a common vision and a common 
  resolve&quot; is all it will take to make the harmonic convergence begin.</p>
<p>When this happens, extraterrestrial beings, including the Maya--who Arguelles 
  believes were extraterrestrials <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(tch 
  tch)</font>, who left the earth, leaving only a few witnesses behind--will decide 
  that we Earthlings finally have trust and can be trusted. They will come to 
  our assistance.<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Los Angeles

<p align="center">THE IMPORTANCE OF CONVERGENCE CALLS THOUSANDS</p>
<p>According to one reading of the Mayan calendar, this weekend heralds a &quot;harmonic 
  convergence,&quot; a cosmic pause to adjust your vibrational rate for the age 
  to come.</p>
<p>And there are those cynical souls who think it's all poppycock...</p>
<p>The big question was whether various observances would attract the minimum 
  144,000 people, a number harmonic theorist Jose Arguelles says are needed &quot;to 
  create a field of trust, to ground the new vibrational frequencies coming in 
  at that time.&quot;...</p>
<p>Michael Coe of Yale University, an authority on Mayan culture, said Arguelles' 
  predictions are &quot;totally crackpot.&quot; &quot;It;s based on a hodgepodge 
  of astrology, UFOlogy, the Mayan calendar, Aztec gods and a dash of New-Age 
  philosophy,&quot; said Paul Kurtz, a philosopher at the State University of 
  New York...and chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of 
  Claims of the Paranormal.</p>
<p>The convergence is reminiscent of the &quot;Jupiter effect&quot; which was 
  supposed to to get rid of California once and for all back in 1982 when all 
  the planets were lined up on one side of the sun. Arguelles' theory is much 
  more upbeat and, unlike the Jupiter effect, it doesn't call for anything to 
  happen this weekend.<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Associated

<p>When the dawn's early light bathes you this Sunday, will you be humming for 
  global peace? Or simply snoozing away a summer morning? Sunday and Monday herald 
  the Harmonic Convergence when astrologers spot weird configurations in the stars, 
  ancient prophecies from the Hopi and Aztecs are supposed to come due, a new

<p align="center">COMING NEW AGE WILL ARRIVE NONE TOO SOON</p>
<p align="center">By Dave Peyton</p>
<p>I suspect most of you chuckled a little last weekend at the stories of the 
  Harmonic Convergence that was supposed to have taken place. I admit that some 
  of the stories I heard were a little bizarre... At the Serpent Mound in Adams 
  County, Ohio, I saw a thousand or more truly optimistic people from all walks 
  of life join hands to dance and chant their aspirations for a better world. 
  The Adams County sheriff said he had never seen a more peaceful bunch.</p>
<p>There's a lot of talk about what all of this meant. There's debate over what, 
  if anything, happened. I don't pretend to know all the answers, but I think 
  we all know some of them in our heart of hearts. I think we've all been tasting 
  a little of what the participants in the Harmonic Convergence feasted on last 
  weekend. It's difficult to explain what it is, exactly. But don't you have a 
  sense that something awesome is about to happen?</p>
<p>OK, maybe it's just the times. Social scientists say that when civilization 
  changes too rapidly, a people tend to become disoriented. Like animals that 
  sense when a storm is near, we become restless. We do outrageous things. Sometimes 
  we get downright goofy and make fools of ourselves.</p>
<p>Lord knows we're in such a time. Things are speeding up. We're moving from 
  one age to the next so swiftly, we can't stop to enjoy events, let alone explain 
  them. But I think there's more to it. I think there's a sense of great excitement--the 
  excitement that comes from knowing that something monumental is a heartbeat 
  away. The question is: What the heck is it?</p>
<p>Maybe we need to take a personal inventory. We know that &quot;business as 
  usual&quot; is out of the question. Why? Because &quot;business as usual&quot; 
  got us where we are today--teetering on the absolute brink of destruction.</p>
<p>We know for a fact we are raping and ravaging Mother Earth in ways that prevent 
  her from regenerating. The ozone layer, which protects us from deadly solar 
  rays, is disappearing. The rain that's supposed to cleanse the earth contains 
  sulfuric acid. The threat of nuclear annihilation has become so intense, we 
  can't stand it. So we joke about it because we all feel so helpless, so alone.</p>
<p>We know we can't continue the way we have been. The words of Swami Bhaktipada 
  of the Hare Krishna sect...rings so true: &quot;The earth will be purified one 
  way or the other. Either we humans do it, or there'll be a nuclear holocaust 
  that will purify it for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Some of us still look to traditional religion. But deep inside we sense that, 
  while the old ways can give us much strength to suffer the fears and indignities 
  we all share, they have fallen short of solving the problems. In fact some clerics 
  have simply given up trying to change things. All they offer is solace at best 
  and a collection plate at worst.</p>
<p>The people who danced and chanted in the New Age celebration were, I believe, 
  sending us a message...Those I have spoken to since last weekend said that it 
  makes no difference whether we heard or not. The convergence is complete. Believers 
  and non-believers alike will feel it soon.<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

  Subject: Corrected' Insights into the Mayan Calendar<br>
  Dear Friends, I found this article very interesting and informational - more 
  wisdom from the ages. May you know Peace on all levels of your existence...Kathleen</p>
<p>The Mayan Calendar - The World will Not End...</p>
<p>Carlos Barrios was born into a Spanish family on El Altiplano, the highlands 
  of Guatemala. His home was in Huehuetenango, also the dwelling place of the 
  Maya Mam tribe. With other Maya and other indigenous tradition keepers, the 
  Man carry part of the old ways on Turtle Island (North America). They are keepers 
  of time, authorities on remarkable calendars that are ancient, elegant and relevant.</p>
<p>Mr. Barrios is a historian, an anthropologist and investigator. After studying 
  with traditional elders for 25 years since the age of 19, he has also became 
  a Mayan Ajq'ij, a ceremonial priest and spiritual guide, Eagle Clan. Years ago, 
  along with his brother, Gerardo, Carlos initiated an investigation into the 
  different Mayan calendars. He studied with many teachers. He says his brother 
  Gerardo interviewed nearly 600 traditional Mayan elders to widen their scope 
  of knowledge.</p>
<p>&quot;Anthropologists visit the temple sites,&quot; Mr. Barrios says, &quot;and 
  read the stelas and inscriptions and make up stories about the Maya, but they 
  do not read the signs correctly. It's just their imagination... Other people 
  write about prophecy in the name of the Maya. They say that the world will end 
  in December 2012. The Mayan elders are angry with this. The world will not end. 
  It will be transformed. The indigenous have the calendars, and know how to accurately 
  interpret it, not others.&quot;</p>
<p>The Calendars</p>
<p>Mayan comprehension of time, seasons, and cycles has proven itself to be vast 
  and sophisticated. The Maya understand 17 different calendars, some of them 
  charting time accurately over a span of more than ten million years. The calendar 
  that has steadily drawn global attention since 1987 is called the Tzolk'in or 
  Cholq'ij. Devised ages ago and based on the cycle of the Pleiades, it is still 
  held as sacred. With the indigenous calendars, native people have kept track 
  of important turning points in history. For example, the daykeepers who study 
  the calendars identified an important day in the year One Reed, Ce Acatal, as 
  it was called by the Mexicans. That was the day when an important ancestor was 
  prophesied to return, &quot;coming like a butterfly.&quot;</p>
<p>In the western calendar, the One Reed date correlates to Easter Sunday, April 
  21, 1519 the day that Hernando Cortez and his fleet of 11 Spanish galleons arrived 
  from the East at what is today called Vera Cruz, Mexico. When the Spanish ships 
  came toward shore, native people were waiting and watching to see how it would 
  go. The billowing sails of the ships did indeed remind the scouts of butterflies 
  skimming the ocean surface. In this manner was a new era initiated, an era they 
  had anticipated through their calendars. The Maya termed the new era the Nine 
  Bolomtikus, or nine Hells of 52 years each. As the nine cycles unfolded, land 
  and freedom were taken from the native people. Disease and disrespect dominated. 
  What began with the arrival of Cortez, lasted until August 16, 1987 - a date 
  many people recall as Harmonic Convergence. Millions of people took advantage 
  of that date to make ceremony in sacred sites, praying for a smooth transition 
  to a new era, the World of the Fifth Sun.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/FiveWorlds.gif" width="640" height="495"></p>
<p>From that 1987 date until now, Mr. Barrios says, we have been in a time when 
  the right arm of the materialistic world is disappearing, slowly but inexorably. 
  We are at the cusp of the era when peace begins, and people live in harmony 
  with Mother Earth. We are no longer in the World of the Fourth Sun, but we are 
  not yet in the World of the Fifth Sun. This is the time in-between, the time 
  of transition. As we pass through transition there is a colossal, global convergence 
  of environmental destruction, social chaos, war, and ongoing Earth changes. 
  All this, Mr. Barrios says, was foreseen via the simple, spiral mathematics 
  of the Mayan calendars. &quot;It will change,&quot; Mr. Barrios observes. &quot;Everything 
  will change.&quot; He said Mayan Daykeepers view the Dec. 21, 2012 date as a 
  rebirth, the start of the World of the Fifth Sun. It will be the start of a 
  new era resulting from and signified by the solar meridian crossing the galactic 
  equator, and the earth aligning itself with the center of the galaxy.</p>
<p>At sunrise on December 21, 2012 for the first time in 26,000 years the Sun 
  rises to conjunct the intersection of the Milky Way and the plane of the ecliptic. 
  This cosmic cross is considered to be an embodiment of the Sacred Tree, The 
  Tree of Life a tree remembered in all the world's spiritual traditions. Some 
  observers say this alignment with the heart of the galaxy in 2012 will open 
  a channel for cosmic energy to flow through the earth, cleansing it and all 
  that dwells upon it, raising all to a higher level of vibration.</p>
<p>This process has already begun, Mr. Barrios suggested. &quot;Change is accelerating 
  now, and it will continue to accelerate.&quot; If the people of the earth can 
  get to this 2012 date in good shape, without having destroyed too much of the 
  Earth, Mr. Barrios said, we will rise to a new, higher level. But to get there 
  we must transform enormously powerful forces that seek to block the way.</p>
<p>A Picture of the Road Ahead</p>
<p>From his understanding of the Mayan tradition and the calendars, Mr. Barrios 
  offered a picture of where we are at and what may lie on the road ahead: The 
  date specified in the calendar , Winter Solstice in the year 2012, does not 
  mark the end of the world. Many outside people writing about the Mayan calendar 
  sensationalize this date, but they do not know. The ones who know are the indigenous 
  elders who are entrusted with keeping the tradition &quot;Humanity will continue,&quot; 
  he contends, &quot;but in a different way. Material structures will change. 
  From this we will have the opportunity to be more human.&quot;</p>
<p>We are living in the most important era of the Mayan calendars and prophecies. 
  All the prophecies of the world, all the traditions, are converging now. There 
  is no time for games. The spiritual ideal of this era is action. Many powerful 
  souls have reincarnated in this era, with a lot of power. This is true on both 
  sides, the light and the dark. High magic is at work on both sides. Things will 
  change, but it is up to the people how difficult or easy it is for the changes 
  to come about. The economy now is a fiction. The first five-year stretch of 
  transition from August 1987 to August 1992 &lt; was the beginning of the destruction 
  of the material world. We have progressed ten years deeper into the transition 
  phase by now, and many of the so-called sources of financial stability are in 
  fact hollow.</p>
<p>The banks are weak. This is a delicate moment for them. They could crash globally 
  if we don't pay attention. One critical period is October and November 2002. 
  If the banks crash in these months then we will be forced to rely on the land 
  and our skills. The monetary systems will be in chaos, and we must then rely 
  on our direct relationship with the Earth for our food and shelter. The North 
  and South Poles are both breaking up. The level of the water in the oceans is 
  going to rise. But at the same time land in the ocean, especially near Cuba, 
  is also going to rise.</p>
<p>A Call for Fusion</p>
<p>As he met with audiences in Santa Fe, Mr. Barrios told a story about the most 
  recent Mayan New Year ceremonies in Guatemala. He said that one respected Mam 
  elder, who lives all year in a solitary mountain cave, journeyed to Chichicastenango 
  to speak with the people at the ceremony. The elder delivered a simple, direct 
  message. He called for human beings to come together in support of life and 
  light. Right now each person and group is going his or her own way. The elder 
  of the mountains said there is hope IF THE PEOPLE OF LIGHT CAN COME TOGETHER 
  AND UNITE IN SOME WAY.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, Mr. Barrios explained: &quot;We live in a world of polarity: 
  day and night, man and woman, positive and negative. Light and darkness need 
  each other. They are a balance. Just now the dark side is very strong, and very 
  clear about what they want. They have their vision and their priorities clearly 
  held, and also their hierarchy. They are working in many ways so that we will 
  be unable to connect with the spiral Fifth World in 2012.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the light side everyone thinks they are the most important, that their 
  own understandings, or their group's understandings, are the key. There's a 
  diversity of cultures and opinions, SO THERE IS COMPETITION, DIFFUSION, AND 
  NO SINGLE FOCUS.&quot; As Mr. Barrios sees it, the dark side works to block 
  fusion through denial and materialism. It also works to destroy those who are 
  working with the light to get the Earth to a higher level. They like the energy 
  of the old, declining Fourth World, the materialism. They do not want it to 
  change. They do not want fusion. They want to stay at this level, and are afraid 
  of the next level.</p>
<p>The dark power of the declining Fourth World cannot be destroyed or overpowered. 
  It's too strong and clear for that, and that is the wrong strategy. The dark 
  can only be transformed when confronted with simplicity and open-heartedness. 
  This is what leads to fusion, a key concept for the World of the Fifth Sun.</p>
<p>(Here is where the vision of the Hebrew Prophets Mr. Barrios said the emerging 
  era of the Fifth Sun will call attention to a much-overlooked element. Whereas 
  the four traditional elements of earth, air, fire and water have dominated various 
  epochs in the past, there will be a fifth element to reckon with in the time 
  of the Fifth Sun: ether. The dictionary defines ether as the rarefied element 
  of the Heavens. Ether is a medium. It permeates all space and transmits waves 
  of energy in a wide range of frequencies, from cell phones to human auras. What 
  is &quot;ethereal&quot; is related to the regions beyond earth: the heavens.</p>
<p>Ether the element of the Fifth Sun is celestial and lacking in material substance, 
  but is no less real than wood, stone or flesh. &quot;Within the context of ether 
  there can be a fusion of the polarities,&quot; Mr. Barrios said. &quot;No more 
  darkness or light in the people, but an uplifted fusion. But right now the realm 
  of darkness is not interested in this. They are organized to block it. They 
  seek to unbalance the Earth and its environment so we will be unready for the 
  alignment in 2012. We need to work together for peace, and balance with the 
  other side. We need to take care of the Earth that feeds and shelters us. We 
  need to put our entire mind and heart into pursuing unity and fusion now, to 
  confront the other side and preserve life.&quot;</p>
<p>To be Ready for this Moment in History Mr. Barrios told his audiences in Santa 
  Fe that we are at a critical moment of world history. &quot;We are disturbed,&quot; 
  he said. &quot;We can't play anymore. Our planet can be renewed or ravaged. 
  Now is the time to awaken and take action.&quot; &quot;Everyone is needed. You 
  are not here for no reason. Everyone who is here now has an important purpose. 
  This is a hard, but a special time. We have the opportunity for growth, but 
  we must be ready for this moment in history.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Barrios offered a number of suggestions to help people walk in balance 
  through the years ahead. &quot;The prophesied changes are going to happen,&quot; 
  he said &quot;but our attitude and actions determine how harsh or mild they 
  are.&quot; We need to act, to make changes, and to elect people to represent 
  us who understand and who will take political action to respect the earth. Meditation 
  and spiritual practice are good, but also action. It's very important to be 
  clear about who you are, and also about your relation to the Earth.</p>
<p>Develop yourself according to your own tradition and the call of your heart. 
  But remember to respect differences, and strive for unity. Eat wisely. A lot 
  of food is corrupt in either subtle or gross ways. Pay attention to what you 
  are taking into your body. Learn to preserve food, and to conserve energy. Learn 
  some good breathing techniques, so you have mastery of your breath.</p>
<p>Be clear. Follow a tradition with great roots. It is not important what tradition, 
  your heart will tell you, but it must have great roots. We live in a world of 
  energy. An important task at this time is to learn to sense or see the energy 
  of everyone and everything: people, plants, animals. This becomes increasingly 
  important as we draw close to the World of the Fifth Sun, for it is associated 
  with the element ether--the realm where energy lives and weaves. Go to the sacred 
  places of the earth to pray for peace, and respect for the Earth which gives 
  us our food, clothing, and shelter. We need to reactivate the energy of these 
  sacred places. That is our work.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Barrios' reading of the Mayan calendar, if war happens in 
  November 2002 or after, then it's bad, but not catastrophic. But if it happens 
  between April and November 2003, it will be catastrophic. Really bad. It could 
  eventually result in the death of two-thirds of humanity. &quot;So stay active,&quot; 
  he said. &quot;If we are active, we can transform the planet. The elders watch 
  to see what happens.&quot; Many Mayan elders and knowledge keepers may be eliminated 
  in the next few years. For the first half of the current Katun (20-year period) 
  the dark side has a lot of power. But that will pass 3 to 4 years from now. 
  The tide can turn. Amazing things are going to happen. </p>
<p>One simple but effective prayer technique is to light a white or baby-blue 
  colored candle. Think a moment in peace. Speak your intention to the flame and 
  send the light of it on to the leaders who have the power to make war or peace.</p>
<p>We Have Work to Do</p>
<p>According to Mr. Barrios this is a crucially important moment for humanity, 
  and for earth. Each person is important. If you have incarnated into this era, 
  you have spiritual work to do balancing the planet. He said the elders have 
  opened the doors so that other races can come to the Mayan world to receive 
  the tradition. The Maya have long appreciated and respected that there are other 
  colors, other races, and other spiritual systems. &quot;They know,&quot; he 
  said, &quot;that the destiny of the Mayan world is related to the destiny of 
  the whole world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The greatest wisdom is in simplicity,&quot; Mr. Barrios advised before 
  leaving Santa Fe. &quot;Love, respect, tolerance, sharing, gratitude, forgiveness. 
  It's not complex or elaborate. The real knowledge is free. It's encoded in your 
  DNA. All you need is within you. Great teachers have said that from the beginning. 
  Find your heart, and you will find your way.&quot;</p>
<p>Carlos Barrios is the author of Kam Wuj: El Libro del Destino, a book published 
  in Spanish that explores Mayan teachings. He is looking for a way to have the

<p>The emphasis in house music and dance culture on physiologically compatible 
  rhythms and this sort of thing is really the rediscovery of the art of natural 
  magic with sound; that sound, properly understood, especially percussive sound, 
  can actually change neurological states, and large groups of people getting 
  together in the presence of this kind of music are creating a telepathic community 
  of bonding that hopefully will be strong enough that it can carry the vision 
  out into the mainstream of society. I think that the youth culture that is emerging 
  in the nineties is an end of the millennium culture that is actually summing 
  up Western civilization and pointing us in an entirely different direction, 
  that we&#146;re going to arrive in the third millennium, in the middle of the 
  archaic revival, which will mean a revival of these physiologically empowering 
  rhythm signatures, a new art, a new social vision, a new relationship to nature, 
  to feminism, to ego. All of these things are taking hold, and not a moment too 
  soon.<b>--</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Terence McKenna</font></p>

<p align="center">IS TODAY BEGINNING OF THE END?</p>
<p align="center">By Monty Fowler</p>
<p>HUNTINGTON, WEST VIRGINIA:</p>
<p>SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1988__Today, the dawn of what some say may be the beginning 
  of the end, some believers are following the Boy Scout motto: Be prepared.</p>
<p>If the local believers have calculated correctly, Jesus Christ will arrive 
  to take them to heaven and leave behind the heathen, an event they call the 
  Rapture. If not today, they predict, he'll be here at least by Tuesday evening. 
  One area church has experienced a surge in baptisms IN PREPARATION FOR SEPTEMBER 
  11-13, THE DAYS DURING WHICH ED WHISENANT PREDICTS THE APOCALYPSE WILL START.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a cult about the end of the world. We are not marching around 
  with placards,&quot; the Rev. Edwin S. Harper said. &quot;If you had this information, 
  it would be foolish not to do anything about it--my position is one of caution.&quot;</p>
<p>Harper's Staunton Street Apostolic Church ran a full-page ad in the Herald 
  Dispatch warning of the Rapture. He said that although the Bible states no one 
  can know the exact date, &quot;It only makes sense to be prepared.&quot; Not 
  only will there be a physical exodus from the Earth, the Bible says, BUT THE 
  DEAD WHO PLACED THEIR FAITH IN CHRIST DURING THEIR LIFETIME, WILL RISE FROM 
  THEIR GRAVES BEFORE THE SEVEN YEARS OF WAR, pestilence and disease begin, Harper 
  said...</p>
<p>Others, though, say there's no more to this latest calculation's demise than 
  similar predictions of the past. Dr. E.S. Hanrahan, dean of the College of Science 
  at Marshall University, said no scientific evidence supports the end-of-all 
  scenario. &quot;I'm not knocking their belief,&quot; he said. &quot;The Bible 
  is a marvelous book, but its subject to interpretations.&quot; </p>
<p>Then why are so many people treating this latest date so seriously? &quot;It's 
  just a sign of our times--people are looking for reassurance that it isn't going 
  to happen,&quot; Hanrahan said. &quot;We have a capability to end the world 
  now--with nuclear war--and we've been living with that for a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>Whisenant's booklet, distributed by the World Bible Society, in Nashville, 
  is in two parts titled &quot;On Borrowed Time&quot; and &quot;88 reasons Why 
  the Rapture is in 1988.&quot; The Rapture could be in 1988. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(See 
  1 Thessalonians 4:14-18...KJV)</font>. In his booklet, Whisenant says he used 
  mathematics, the Bible, and other things to arrive at the date OF THE BEGINNING 
  OF THE END...</p>
<p>Harper said he learned the importance of today's date in 1975, &quot;when it 
  became very apparent we were becoming very close to the 40th anniversary of 
  Israel becoming a nation.&quot; The significance of the 1948 establishment of 
  Israel is revealed in the Bible,&quot; Harper said. In the readings of Matthew, 
  the New Testament says the sign that Christ is returning will occur a generation 
  after the Fig Tree--Israel, Harper said--starts putting forth new branches and 
  begins to grow again. A generation in biblical references is 40 years...and 
  the new growth started when the state of Israel was created--hence the 1988 
  date. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">( We didn't learn the parable 
  of the Fig Tree...Matthew 24:32-34. Please see Chapter 10, Ephraim Goes Backwards)</font>.</p>
<p>In the booklet, Whisenant points out that Rosh Hashanna--the Jewish New year--will 
  be celebrated this year FROM SUNSET SEPTEMBER 11 TO Sunset Sept.13, the day 
  he has predicted for the Rapture...If the Rapture does not come, other doomsayers 
  are actively predicting an end to planet Earth, be it from the greenhouse effect, 
  nuclear war, or planetary alignments, in which other planets in the solar system 
  gang up on Earth to pull it apart with excessive gravitational forces.</p>
<p>The most recent instance of the planetary alignment theory is the so-called 
  Jupiter Effect in 1982, in which Jupiter and other planets were supposedly aligned 
  to exert unusual forces on the Earth, causing massive earthquakes in California. 
  But as Marshall astronomer Nicholas Orsini points out, California is still there 
  six years later. &quot;Back when this all came up, I calculated the attraction 
  between two people standing a meter apart would be stronger than this alignment,&quot; 
  he said. &quot;Jupiter is always there. We go through the 'Jupiter effect' every 
  day.&quot;...</p>
<p>As for today, &quot;nothing is going to happen. There is nothing in the heavens 
  that is ominous at this time,&quot; Orsini said. &quot;But if it's divine intervention, 
  it's beyond me to predict it.&quot;<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

<p align="center">RAPTURE AD BRINGS WAVES OF BAPTISMS</p>
<p align="center">By Stevan L. Hermon</p>
<p>MONDAY, September 12__Evangelical warnings of AN IMMINENT &quot;BEGINNING OF 
  AN END&quot; have prompted a baptism boom in West Virginia and elsewhere, but 
  most religious leaders and scientists say there is no evidence to support claims 
  that the Rapture will occur this week...Harper's followers and some other Christians 
  believe that the prelude to the second coming of Christ would occur during the 
  Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana, which began at sundown Sunday...The Rapture, 
  according to religious tenets, is the period at the end of the world in which 
  those who believe in God will be called to heaven.</p>
<p>Whisenant, a former NASA rocket engineer, uses mathematical calculations and 
  Biblical interpretations to pinpoint the event to the 48 hours of this year's 
  Rosh Hashana--40 years and 120 days after the Jewish state of Israel became 
  a nation on May 14, 1948...Other religious leaders, however, say there's no 
  way to predict such things. &quot;That's the mystery of God,&quot; said Father 
  Robert Nash, chancellor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. 
  &quot;It's in God's time, which he has not chosen to reveal.&quot;...</p>
<p>Rabbi Victor Urecki of B'Nai Jacob, a Conservative Jewish synagogue in Charleston, 
  said he was being swamped with calls from Christians as Rosh Hashana neared. 
  &quot;They're fundamental Christians asking about the Feast of Trumpets,&quot; 
  he said. &quot;I don't understand why this is tied in so much this year with 
  Rosh Hashana.&quot;...</p>
<p>Randy Thompson, director of the Christian Studies Center in New Haven, Conn., 
  said the Rapture appeals mainly to fundamentalist Christians who interpret the 
  Bible as the literal word of God. Believing that the Lord will swoop down and 
  pluck the faithful off Earth is particularly appealing during times of trouble, 
  Thompson said. There is no scientific evidence of the end-of-the-world scenario, 
  scientists say.</p>
<p>Urecki and Marshall astronomer Nicola Orsini said the hullabaloo reminds them 
  of THE SO-CALLED JUPITER EFFECT OF 1982 AND THIS SPRING'S HARMONIC CONVERGENCE, 
  which also predicted sudden transformations of life on Earth.<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

  underlines the fact that 'No man knows the day nor the hour of the Lord's return.' 
  Christ has told us all TO WATCH AND BE READY,&quot; Harper said. But &quot;it 
  has not hurt the faith of the church,&quot; he emphasized. &quot;It has exposed 
  more to the church.&quot;...</p>
<p>&quot;All of then dates have been wrong,&quot; Tolbert said. &quot;The odds 
  of anybody being right are certainly greater than the odds of winning the recent

<p align="center">WHISENANT MOVES RAPTURE DATE--JUST A LITTLE</p>
<p align="center">Gannett News Service</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY, September 14__Edgar C. Whisenant, the man who predicted that Jesus 
  would return to Earth by 11 a.m. CDT Tuesday, has revised the date of the Rapture. 
  The new date: at 9:55 a.m. CDT Wednesday. The problem, it seems, was with the 
  international date line.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm still on go with this. I still believe this message is true,&quot; 
  Whisenant said...Whisenant has declined in recent days to talk with reporters 
  from the secular press, claiming his message :is for the bride of Christ,&quot; 
  the church. </p>
<p>Dianne McArthur (of station KAAY in Little Rock, Ark.) said Whisenant changed 
  his mind about the date because of a telephone call he received Monday night. 
  &quot;The caller asked Whisenant if he had considered the fact that Rosh Hashana 
  would officially end at sundown on the international date line&quot; rather 
  than in Jerusalem, as earlier thought by Whisenant. McArthur said Whisenant 
  based his calculations in part on occurrence of the Jewish new year. &quot;Therefore 
  the new date, as best Ed can figure it is 9:55 on Wednesday. &quot;Ed had always 
  thought God's heart was in Jerusalem, so he naturally had Jerusalem in mind...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/dragon.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p>McArthur, a supporter of Whisenant's views, said she had &quot;tried to encourage 
  him all along. I told Ed that if there's been miscalculation regarding the dates, 
  he could still know that he had waked up a sleeping church around this world,&quot; 
  McArthur said. &quot;And that's the truth, because his message was been carried 
  around the world.&quot;<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

<p>Harper, pastor of Staunton Street Apostolic Church, said everyone should be 
  prepared for Christ's return even though it can't be predicted. &quot;Our position

<p align="center">SYMBOLIC MEANING TO RAPTURE TEACHING</p>
<p>TO THE EDITOR, HUNTINGTON DISPATCH__If someone could grab the church by the 
  shoulders and shake some correct interpretation into it, and its fixation with 
  the literal word out of it, and if one could also shake it out of the garments 
  of intellectual pride in which it is (partly) clothed, it might learn how to 
  interpret the meaning of the event it is calling the &quot;Rapture.&quot;</p>
<p>It might learn what it means to be &quot;caught up.&quot; Caught up to what? 
  And to where? &quot;To meet the Lord in the Air,&quot; Paul says (1 Thessalonians 
  4:13-18). But what does he mean? Paul is a son of the Torah, and a child of 
  the Prophets. He was no foreigner to the symbolic language employed by those 
  ancients, and he employs it here when he paraphrases Moses: <i>Ye have seen 
  what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bare you on Eagle's Wings, and brought 
  you unto myself.</i> (Exodus 19:4).</p>
<p>The children of Israel did not &quot;disappear&quot; from the earth in those 
  times, but they were <i>caught up</i> to God. The prophets say that, once again, 
  will the Spirit of God be poured out upon all flesh (Joel 2:28), and Paul is 
  describing in purely symbolic language (which is plain to those who are residing 
  in the Spirit) how the spirit in man rises up to meet it. He says the same in 
  2 Corinthians 12 and 13, where he describes his own &quot;rapture: to the <i>Third 
  Heaven</i>, where he saw and herd things that were then unlawful to reveal. 
  But he did not leave the earth in a physical sense; it was his mind that was 
  caught up. It was caught up into another dimension, to a higher way of understanding 
  the mystery of the Presence of God in the world. The apocryphal Book of Enoch 
  tells us that on the Third Heaven is the Tree of Life...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ChristMystery.gif" width="675" height="501"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Revelation 2:7.</b></p>
<p>...Besides discovering his own exalted place on the World Tree, Paul's mind 
  was carried into the future, into our times and to the words: <i>To him that 
  overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of 
  the Paradise of God</i>. (Revelation 2:7). Paul went on a mystical journey into 
  the heavens of human comprehension.</p>
<p>To discover the meanings of it we, like Paul, must abandon our old affections 
  and our literal interpretations, and yield ourselves to the Spirit that is overshadowing 
  our times. We might then discover that a <i>Rapture</i> is indeed happening, 
  and that the Messiah is indeed being manifest in this holy season of the Seventh 
  Month.<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michael Murphy, Huntington,

<p align="center">(OPENED SENATE AS GUEST CHAPLAIN)</p>
<p align="center">By Debra Lewis</p>
<p>A Huntington minister will try to take a little piece of home to the inauguration 
  on Friday of George (H.W.) Bush. The Rev. Edwin S. Harper of the Staunton Street 
  Apostolic Church said he would take a token of Huntington to present to Bush 
  as a gesture of West Virginians' kindness.</p>
<p>Harper arrived Wednesday morning in Washington to begin a round of banquets 
  and black-tie celebrations marking the inaugural. He said he hoped his presence 
  would bring some attention to the state. </p>
<p>He is a member of a SEVEN-MINISTER DELEGATION from the General United Pentecostal 
  Church. The leader of the group is the Rev. N. A. Urshan of St. Louis.</p>
<p>Harper said before leaving he hoped to get a chance to speak to Bush at a private 
  brunch Thursday morning. &quot;I'd like to build a contact with the gentleman 
  and convey the message that West Virginia is a worthy place to spend some federal 
  dollars,&quot; he said. This is the first presidential inaugural for Harper, 
  but it is not the first time he has been to Washington. In February, he opened 
  the Senate as a guest chaplain at the request of Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd 
  of West Virginia.</p>
<p>Urshan is a friend of Bush <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(please 
  see James, chapters 4 and 5, and the Book of Jude)</font>, and the president-elect 
  gave him a personal invitation to bring six ministers to the inaugural festivities, 
  Harper said. He is the only minister from West Virginia to be included in the 
  group...&quot;I HAVE BEEN USING THE VEHICLE OF THE CHURCH TO STIR THE MENTALITY 
  OF THE PEOPLE...TO TRY TO ATTRACT BUSINESSES TO HUNTINGTON,&quot; he said.<b>

<p align="center">BUSH: 'WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO.'</p>
<p align="center">By Lee Byrd</p>
<p>WASHINGTON__George Bush, on the eve of his swearing-in as president, said Thursday 
  he plans no instant domestic initiatives--no &quot;first 100 days&quot;--and 
  isn't ready to entertain a new East-West summit or arms talks pending a reassessment 
  of superpower relations.</p>
<p>Bush said his inaugural address, after taking THE PRESIDENTIAL OATH ay noon 
  Friday, would be &quot;a broad appeal to the American people to pitch in and 
  help,&quot; but without many specific calls to action. Bush met with news agency 
  journalists at the White House prior to reporting to the Oval Office for his 
  last meeting with President Reagan as his subordinate. After talking privately--a 
  weekly habit on Thursdays for eight years--the pair went to the Roosevelt Room 
  to share their sentiments with senior White House aides.</p>
<p>According to spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, Bush said, &quot;I wouldn't be the 
  president if not for my teacher here, and my friend.&quot; Reagan, the spokesman 
  said, expressed equal warmth for his successor, and quipped: &quot;George never 
  took my pulse once.&quot;</p>
<p>Bush's upbeat mood was matched by Washington's glorious weather. Inaugural 
  celebrants strolled to and fro without topcoats in balmy-for-January sunshine. 
  A mixture of sunshine and clouds, with an afternoon chill, was predicted for 
  Friday, when Bush takes the oath and more than 10,000 performers join his parade 
  to the White House.<b> </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Huntington

  that. Every Mosque has become a fortress. Terrorized on all sides by a faceless

  of slavery and control to keep us from evolving and ascending, because FEAR, 
  not HATE, is the opposite of LOVE.</font></p>

  of HARD-CORE meta-PHYSICS. Not about money or the stock market or the next attack 
  or set of predictions, but some teaching from learned people that shows that 
  not only is there an Infinite Radiant Creator but that the all powerful has 
  a fantastic cosmic plan for all of humanity and that plan is slowly weaving 
  itself above our very worried, bowed and unconscious heads. Their conclusions 
  are at once blissfully hopeful and starkly terrifying.</font></p>

  was overjoyed. I contacted him as soon as I had read it all and it is with his 
  kind and generous permission that I print his gathered material here. He is 
  looking to publish a BOOK about this coming event to raise global awareness 
  of the date and its consequences for humanity. Just remember you heard it all 
  here first. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the help of Barbara Hand Clow 
  and her Bear Publishing Company, Jose Arguilles published a book in 1985 all

  that if 144,000 people could come together on August 17, 18 and 19 of 1987, 
  and greet the dawn in peace, harmony, prayer, meditation and love, that ALL 
  of the dire predictions of mass death and destruction in the coming age could 
  be pulled DOWN by a FACTOR OF TEN. Millions world-wide heard the call and, practicing 
  the ART OF PEACE, gloriously responded! Angelic beings beamed from TVs, glowing 
  feathered serpents of wisdom, the manifestation of Quetzalquoatal, were seen 
  circling the globe and even the jaded unconscious media was stunned by the outpouring 
  of pure spirit.</font></p>

  must turn it into a GLOBAL EVENT, with music, publicity and celebrations of

  have won. The path we are on will be set in stone and the Earth will move into 
  the pattern of a NECRO-SPHERE, sealing the death vibration that will lead to 
  the extinction of most of the life on this planet in less than 50 years. Those 
  are the stakes. Our survival the prize. Our goal is, once again, to get 144,000

<p>June 6 (2003) someone sent me an article written by John Mirthehiel discussing 
  a chart which he calls the Harmonic Concordance, referring to the Harmonic Convergence 
  in 1987. (That was a worldwide,though mostly celebrated in America, &quot;Happening&quot; 
  where people all over gathered in sacred places to create and strengthen a field 
  of consciousness for opening the heartchakra of the planet Earth, initiated 
  by Jose Arguelles. </p>
<p>Because I've seen the Harmonic Convergence over here in Holland coincide with 
  incredible rainbows appearing which blew my head so to speak (and rainbows are 
  the significators of the link between heaven and earth or God and Man) and because 
  I felt the influence of the Harmonic Convergence 9 months ahead of time as well 
  as 9 months after, without even focussing on the event, I read the article, 
  and looked at the chart. And what a wonderful and interesting this chart this 
  is indeed! Frankly, it is an incredible chart on the day featuring both an eclipse 
  as well as Uranus going Direct again! And, I'm writing this and finding this 
  out exactly at the moment Uranus goes retrograde before this next reversal! 
  My brain is remembering things all of a sudden, awakened (Uranus) to remember 
  the Harmonic Convergence energy of the past (retro).<b> </b></p>

<p>If one does use Chiron which come to think of it almost is conjunct my own, 
  a perfect Star of David appears and for Greenwich with Jupiter rising, together 
  with the Full Moon. At the time of a lunar eclipse the Full Moon is incredibly 
  powerful: the Sun, Earth, Moon and the lunar nodes are focussing in one single 
  energyline as it were, and each eclipse will be experienced simply and most 
  of all by the aspects the Full Moon makes to other planets. And there is a completely 
  perfect Grand Sextile situation surrounding the Full Moon axis at that time, 
  creating a 6 pointed star: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg10.gif" width="496" height="300"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Please see Chapter 1, part 2</b>.</p>
<p>And coincidence of coincidences, my texts on Chiron (only in Dutch) were born 
  9 months after the Harmonic Convergence in May 1988, at the Niagara Waterfalls, 
  a place I will be revisiting this fall in September 2003 again also! These texts 
  discuss amongst others the importance of this image, inspired by the meaning 
  given to this 6 pointed star by Alan Oken in his book Soul Centered Astrology. 
  This star is the symbol of the integration of the personality of the human being 
  (and the three personal characteristics of will, emotion and thinking), and 
  the higher self (with the higher Will, the Compassion of the open heart, and 
  intuition). Mostly it concerns two triangles placed on top of one another. The 
  triangle pointing downwards (involutionary) depicts the ego, the triangle pointing 
  upwards (evolutionary) the higher self and there is some space left in between 
  creating the idea of 7 chakra's or points of transformation, the space in between 
  being the heart chakra connecting the two triangles together ultimately. And 
  usually the two separate triangles can be felt as the two directions one is 
  pulled in often as if two people are living within us, the one (the personality) 
  wants to go this way, the other (being of the nature of the Soul) the other 
  way. We usually become aware of this split within only after some awareness 
  has risen of the existence of the soul. But when these two triangles, the personality 
  and the soul, suddenly are fused, (by way of sudden Uranus energy for instance, 
  the sudden lightning) the star is created, the two triangles fall into one another 
  as it were, creating the 6 pointed star. So yes, that is a pretty rare happening. 
  Most of us are seeking love and the completion of ourselves in another person 
  after all, and not in a sacred inner marriage of soul and ego. And, eh, do continue 
  seeking it that way:-) Because the paradox is, that we very often only by interaction 
  with the outer person find the inner and usually not before, just like the disciple 
  needs the outer guru to find God within. </p>
<p>Back to the chart of the eclipse of November 9: this shows the possibility 
  of this Wholemaking taking place for some, a Wholemaking between soul and ego, 
  the integration of the personality with the soul, in a process which again might 
  very well take 18 months of time. After the enormous tests some of us have been 
  through with the 'heaviness' of the Saturn-Pluto opposition in 2001 and 2002, 
  it seems to me that together we could indeed do with a much Lighter timeframe. 
  Interesting detail: it appears that a cropcircle has been found which looks 
  like a horoscope with a six pointed chart in it, a very powerful image, which 
  is depicted on a site I found meantime on this Harmonic Concordance: www.astrosite.com<b> 
  </b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/CropCircle.jpg" width="468" height="298"></p>
<p>The symbolism of the eclipsed Moon with this thousandfold power for reason 
  of the eclipse alone, is striking in this connection: (acc. to Rudhyar in the 
  Astrological Mandala) </p>
<p>A symbolical battle between 'Swords' and 'Torches'. </p>
<p>When Gautama, having sought in vain for the answers to his questions among 
  the teachers of the tradition, sat under the Bodhi Tree, he had to fight his 
  own battle in his own way, even though it is an eternal fight. The spiritual 
  light within the greater Soul must struggle against the ego-will that only knows 
  how to use the powers of this material and intellectual world. There is no possibility 
  of escape; it is the energy that arises out of the present moment - the inescapable 
  NOW that the daring individual has to use in the struggle.</p>
<p>This symbol suggests that salvation is attained through the emergent individual's 
  readiness to face all issues as if there were only two opposed sides (the Full 
  Moon situation). So teaches the Bhagavad Gita. This is the dharma of this stage 
  of human evolution: a stage of Polarization of Values. This symbolism of the 
  struggle of the &quot;Two&quot; is, this time, aided and supported in a beautiful 
  wholemaking way by the other planets creating a star of completion around the 
  eclipse at this sacred moment in time.</p>

<p>What does the Harmonic Concordance portend for me personally? </p>
<p>The Harmonic Concordance and Lunar Eclipse occurring this fall, November 8/9, 
  2003 exactly, is the promise of a huge planetary shift, and this too will be 
  unprecedented. Those that have been diligently working on a spiritual path will 
  feel a huge deserved boost of positive energy in your personal lives, and in 
  your spiritual acceleration. It is believed that the fifth dimension (love) 
  will be experienced, and lived. Bottom line this is a time for love and peace. 
  The fifth dimension is the love energy, not fear or war. </p>
<p>We can come from either two places love or fear. When we make our choices from 
  love, we always choose right. When we make our choices from fear, we always 
  are out alignment with our soul, Source and nature. To live authentically and 
  powerfully we must be &#147;who&#148; we really are, even if that may appear 
  strange or disappoint others. When you do what is right for you, it will always 
  be right for everyone else. When you live from your soul (inner nature) essence 
  of who you truly are, you are in alignment with divine forces, Source and nature. 
  When you walk away from your Self, you are aligning with forces that are not 
  of the light (Christ) Consciousness. </p>
<p>What is this second coming of the Christ?</p>
<p>The Christ Consciousness (Higher Self) is the invitation of the Harmonic Concordance. 
  We are invited by Source to come up higher and experience a Revolution in Consciousness. 
  There are many who believe Jesus the Christ will physically reappear and all 
  those that &#148;believe&#148; will be taken up in the Rapture with him. Is 
  that after he walks down Main Street, stops in Starbucks for a cappuccino and 
  then sweeps all the believers into the heavenly world with him? </p>
<p>This simply is not true and is fairy tale religion. Neptune (religion and spirituality) 
  makes a powerful T-square TO BOTH SUN (consciousness) AND MOON (unconsciousness) 
  in this chart. Reinforcing the dividing of the way between those who take Self-responsibility 
  for their spiritual and personal path and those that believe their religion 
  is the only way and the savior is external. Those that believe their religion, 
  belief system, reality is the only true path to God excluding all others, will 
  be cemented in the third dimension, fearing and feeling threatened by all others 
  that oppose their narrow view. </p>
<p>Those that are open minded, compassionate and tolerate of other people&#146;s 
  religion, approaches to life, and ideals, will be expanded in consciousness, 
  and live the abundant life. How do you know if you in your Higher Self or ego/fear/ 
  dweller on the threshold/shadow side? Always base your choices from your true 
  values, integrity and honor. When you do what is right for You it is right for 
  everyone else. Do not walk away from what is right and correct for Self just 
  to please others or not make waves. Make your choices from love and compassion 
  not fear. </p>
<p>What will a Revolution in Consciousness imply? </p>
<p>The Christ is being born in you! You will be walking, talking, breathing, and 
  living in the Christ Consciousness, and this is what the prophecy has foretold. 
  You are to become the Christ incarnate, everyday you choose love and compassion, 
  you put on the Christ Consciousness. This reality occurs daily by merging with 
  your Higher Self. The Higher Self of each one represents the Christ Consciousness. 
  The anointed one is You, when merged with your Higher Self. Miracles will manifest 
  in your life because you have risen to a higher consciousness, forged with your 
  Higher Self, overcome fear, and from this place of love, and light you can make 
  your dreams reality. You are here to have it all! And, never to &#147;settle!&#148; 
</p>
<p>Kissing the face of Menacing Mars in Pisces&#133;</p>
<p>We are living in extraordinary and perilous times-both astrologically and in 
  reality. On August 27, Mars the God of war, weaponry, desire, aggression, testosterone, 
  and rage will be the closest to our Earth and Sun it has been in 60,000 years. 
  This is unprecedented in our lifetime and will not occur again until 2287. </p>
<p>Retrograde Mars, a few confused men and women? </p>
<p>Mars (warrior) has been in Pisces (spiritual) since June 17; he turns retrograde 
  on July 29 and goes direct September 27. However, his shadow period lasts until 
  Nov. 8 the day of the Harmonic Concordance. When Mars is, direct he represents 
  our energy pushing outward, a time to move, change, and take action. When he 
  is retrograde, the same force is directed inward, it is an ideal time to examine 
  what has driven you this past year, and discover the inner emotional patterns 
  changing, take charge of your life. Revitalize Self, practice Extreme Self Care, 
  restrategize your plans, to attract in more of what you truly desire. Cut away 
  all that no longer serves you, your path, and your destiny. Watch for extreme 
  confusion, craziness with Self and others, leave nothing to chance. Double-check 
  all of your contracts, communications, and intentions with others. Take your 
  time! Mars is conjunct Uranus (the wild card) until the end of 2003. A psychedelic 
  mind trip, watch Self for mind wars. Clean out all self-sabotaging behaviors 
  that are in the way of this exceptional lifetime spiritual opportunity. </p>
<p>Why not come apart from the world and choose to be chosen? Focus on what you 
  can do, that is love, accept, and nurture you. Come apart from the world; dial 
  out of the negatives (media, religion, government, institutions, etc.) I hear 
  too much self-hatred, forgive Self, stop the criticism and self judgment. Be 
  proactive not reactive. We need each precious one of you to bring in our age 
  of freedom and enlightenment--The Age of Aquarius. There is no one to take your 
  place. Hold the vision for peace, we will shift and evolve out of our present 
  day extreme violent adolescence. Celebrate your accomplishments, even the tiny 
  ones. Celebrate when things go through like a breeze. Celebrate with friends 
  and family. Take your time. Meditate daily. Ask Self:</p>
<p>What are my intentions? What are my heart&#146;s desires? What is driving me? 
  What can I clean out? What do I need right now to feel safe, balanced, focused, 
  and secure? Set your goals based on your values, not coulds, woulds, wills or 
  shoulds. Choose love, compassion not fear. </p>

<p align="center">THE HARMONIC CONCORDANCE <br>
  the Total Lunar Eclipse November 9, 2003 </p>
<p align="center">By Paul Newman &amp; Lorraine Exley <br>
  Copyright 2003</p>
<p>THE CATHAR ECLIPSE<br>
  The Total Lunar Eclipse of November 9, 2003, which is also being called &quot;The 
  Harmonic Concordance&quot;, is an important point in the Lunar Saros 126 series 
  which began with a lunar eclipse on July 8, 1210. As this is the birth eclipse 
  of the entire series, it should have a relevance to the flavour of the whole 
  1280-year chain. </p>
<p>&quot;Cathartic&quot; and &quot;Catharsis&quot; are suggested keywords for 
  this chain of lunar eclipses. Both words come from the same root as &quot;Cathar&quot; 
  the religion of cleansing and purity whose followers were brutally wiped out 
  in a papal crusade against them that began in 1209. The Cathars, who resided 
  mainly in the Languedoc region of southern France in the 12th and 13th centuries, 
  were heretics in the eyes of the established Christian Church because they believed 
  in reincarnation and placed a value on the feminine. Their teachers the parfaits 
  (perfected ones) were both men and women. But their greatest heresy was a secret 
  too potentially damaging for the Church of Rome to allow to survive, and the 
  Holy Inquisition was created (in 1233) to hound out any lingering remnants of 
  it. To some extent the Inquisition failed because these secrets were already 
  in the hands of the Knights Templar, but on an outer level the Roman Church 
  did succeed in establishing its version of the story of Christ to the eclipse 
  of any other. </p>
<p>The 1210 astrological chart</p>
<p>This is the initial lunar eclipse in the Saros series 126, dated 8 July 1210, 
  of which the &quot;Harmonic Concordance&quot; eclipse of 9 November 2003 is 
  the last 'total' manifestation in the chain. (The chain finishes in 2490). The 
  initial Moon should hold clues as to the energy spread throughout the 1280-year 
  chain of eclipses and especially to the special eclipse in November 2003. </p>
<p>For charts of historical events we have found it advantageous to use one of 
  the older sets of astrological degree symbols, and the &quot;La Volasfera&quot; 
  set has been employed in this case. (For twentieth century and current events 
  the Sabian Symbols are more favoured). The La Volasfera symbol for the eclipsed 
  Full Moon in 1210 (Capricorn 23) according to Sepharial's translation is: &quot;A 
  wineglass overturned&quot;. </p>
<p>There is something of a disaster implied here. An object that is life-giving 
  and fortifying - a glass of wine - has been spilt. By analogy blood has been 
  spilt. In Christian communion wine is symbolic of the blood of Christ. </p>
<p>The Knights Templar, who were at the height of their power at this time, wore 
  the blood cross on their shirts, but this spilt blood image seems particularly 
  relevant to the event that began in 1209 and continued for several years - The 
  Albigensian Crusade in the Languedoc. This is when the entire Cathar religion 
  was wiped out on an order from the Pope. Tens of thousands of men, women and 
  children were slaughtered for their heretical beliefs. 100 years later the Templars 
  themselves would be subject to a similar papal purge but they were better prepared 
  and they were trained fighters <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(YIKES!)</font> 
  , unlike the Cathars. </p>
<p>A fuller version of the Volasfera symbol for the initial eclipse Moon at Capricorn 
  23, (the French Janduz translation), reads as follows: &quot;A blindfolded woman 
  pulls a man along by the hand. As he follows her, in his haste, he overthrows 
  the table on which they seem to have had a romantic meal&quot; This is the &quot;wineglass 
  overturned&quot; in greater detail. The symbol suggests that a woman is hurrying 
  a man away from a meal that they were both sharing. Maybe she has advance news 
  of hostile forces closing in and is trying to get them both to safety before 
  it's too late. But she is also described as being &quot;blindfolded&quot; so 
  it is not likely that she can see clearly what is going on either. </p>
<p>On another level this image may be a representation of Mary Magdalene trying 
  to save Jesus Christ. The reason for the annihilation of the Cathars by the 
  established Christian Church was to suppress the belief that Mary Magdalene 
  was the wife of Jesus and that they engendered a bloodline. Moreover the suggestion 
  of romance in the symbol, the sharing of earthly pleasures between Jesus and 
  Mary, was another heretical point that would cause the papal armies to kill 
  in the name of God. A cleansing purge and suppression of beliefs are both phrases 
  we could connect to this chain of lunar eclipses. </p>
<p>Other events relevant to 1210:</p>
<p>England was under an Interdict for 5 years at this time (1208-1213) from the 
  same pope (Innocent III) who ordered the annihilation of the Cathars. Celebration 
  of the Mass was prohibited in all churches and the dead had to be buried in 
  unconsecrated ground. This was because King John had refused the Pope's choice 
  for the next Archbishop of Canterbury. It may sound petty today, but if you 
  were a god-fearing soul alive in England in 1210 and a loved one died you would 
  be devastated to think that they were forbidden to be buried in the consecrated 
  grounds of a church they had attended all their life. Many people must have 
  been afraid to die at this time, fearing that their souls would be eternally 
  shut out from heaven. Could it be that this November's eclipse, with its harmonious 
  patterns, promises to bring these and other wandering souls to rest? </p>
<p>The 1210 eclipse is also close to another more famous historical event: the 
  signing of Magna Carta in 1215. Obviously the Magna Carta didn't suddenly spring 
  into being one morning in 1215, it was the end result of work and discussion 
  of the previous years. It is claimed that a Templar Grand Master was standing 
  next to King John when he signed Magna Carta. On one level this may suggest 
  that this November's eclipse, the Harmonic Concordance, has a bearing on human 
  rights, or basic human freedoms - things which are generally associated with 
  Magna Carta. </p>
<p>One of the most popular and influential pieces of writing in Europe at the 
  time of the initial lunar eclipse was Wolfram von Eschenbach's 'Parzival'. In 
  this mystical work Templar knights are described as guardians of the Holy Grail. 
</p>
<p>Eclipses in the Saros series:</p>
<p>The early eclipses in this Saros series ran as follows: July 8, 1210; July 
  18, 1228; July 30, 1246; Aug 9, 1264; Aug 20, 1282; Aug 30, 1300.... Each lunar 
  eclipse will be roughly 18 years plus 10 days after the last. The Total eclipses 
  began on June 19, 1769 with the Peak eclipse (the middle one of the series) 
  on August 13,1859. This Peak Eclipse coincided with the year that Charles Darwin 
  finally published his 'Origin of Species'. He had kept his heretical concepts 
  quiet for some time because he feared a backlash. It was the most revolutionary 
  and (for the church) dangerous idea for centuries. In the 20th century the eclipses 
  in this same series were: Sept. 15, 1913; Sep. 26, 1931; Oct 7, 1949; Oct 18, 
  1967; Oct 28, 1985. </p>
<p> Two things that happened in 1985 (the year of the last eclipse) and may be 
  relevant are: 1. The Greenpeace boat 'Rainbow Warrior' was blown up in New Zealand, 
  and 2. The LiveAid Concert took place. The theme of going against the Establishment 
  can be seen in both of these events. LiveAid was a positive expression of this 
  - raising money to save lives where banks and established agencies were failing. 
  The destruction of 'The Rainbow Warrior' was the other side of the coin, very 
  similar to the Pope's crusade to crush anything that went against the establishment 
  line in the 13th/14th century. It is interesting that it was the French secret 
  service who destroyed the Greenpeace ship because it was the French king who 
  mobilized against the Templars. However many of the original Templars (and Cathars) 
  were French themselves of course. The eclipse before 1985 was in October 1967. 
  This was around the time of student unrest. Although this happened in many countries 
  across the world it was particularly bloody in France. There does appear to 
  be a theme of going against the establishment or persecution by the establishment 
  that runs through this entire eclipse chain. In 2003, the current eclipse year, 
  many people have been against the establishment particularly in terms of the 
  Gulf War. And again the name of one nation stands out: France. </p>
<p>The Sabian symbol of the eclipsed Full Moon in 2003 is &quot;A symbolic battle 
  between Swords and Torches&quot; (Taurus 17). This may hold a reference to Mithras, 
  the sun-god who was often pictured with a Sword in one hand and a Torch in the 
  other. Dane Rudhyar's keynote interpretation of the symbol is: &quot;Refusing 
  to depend on the past, the seeker turns warrior, fighting anew the eternal 'Great 
  War'&quot;. </p>
<p>Like its spiritual ancestor, the Harmonic Convergence of 1987, The Harmonic 
  Concordance of November 8, 2003 also is a call to the Spirit of Humankind to 
  awaken to the idea that we are, in fact, Spiritual beings sharing a physical 
  experience. Consequently, ceremonies and celebrations in honor of this idea 
  are now being scheduled at multiple sacred sites and pilgrimage places throughout 
  the world. As local events are planned for this exciting event, they will be 
  added to this site. In the meantime, for more information on the Harmonic Concordance, 
  please see: The &quot;Home&quot; of the Harmonic Concordance</p>
<p>Johnny and Jan Mirehiel are traveling the country spreading the word. For the 
  latest information, or details on the astrological configuration, see www.astrosite.com

<p>The Yalaha Foundation...A village for lightworkers and enlightenment located 
  in Central Florida, the Yalaha Foundation will be sponsoring a three-day event 
  to celebrate the Harmonic Concordance. For more details, see www.yalahafoundation.org 
</p>
<p>See the Concordance moment in 13 Sacred locations around the World. &quot;...perhaps 
  there is a pattern set up in the heavens for one who desires to see it, and 
  having seen it, to find one in himself.&quot; </p>
<p>Welcome to the home pages of The Harmonic Concordance. This site is devoted 
  to a discussion of the astrological metaphors and spiritual meaning implied 
  in the horoscope of a moment in our future, the total lunar eclipse of November 
  8/9 2003.*</p>
<p>The astrological chart of that moment has a distinctive pattern, or &quot;signature,&quot; 
  which is visible even to the untrained eye. The astrological holograph that 
  the moment projects is fundamentally spiritual in nature, and can be understood 
  terms of Quantum Meta-Physics as well as by 'astro-spiritual' metaphor. It speaks 
  of the descent of God-Consciousness upon this plane and offers a moment in time 
  when humankind can make a concerted effort to rise up to meet it. We have called 
  this moment of attunement The Harmonic Concordance. We believe that it opens 
  an energetic &quot;stargate&quot; to the Ascension of Mother Earth, and to each 
  of her inhabitants. Many have called the attainment of this paradigm the Shift 
  of Ages.</p>
<p>We also know that this gate has always been open, to those willing to step 
  through it. Although this chart depicts a moment in our future, the energies 
  embodied in it can also be used to show us how to activate that moment right 
  NOW. Like its spiritual ancestor, the Harmonic Convergence of 1987, The Harmonic 
  Concordance of 2003 also is a call to the Spirit of Humankind to awaken to the 
  idea that we are, in fact, Spiritual beings sharing a physical experience. Consequently, 
  ceremonies and celebrations in honor of this idea are now being scheduled at 
  multiple sacred sites and pilgrimage places throughout the world. * The Harmonic 
  Concordance chart is timed for the culminating moment of the Total Lunar Eclipse. 
  This will occur at 12':41&quot; after the hour in all time zones. The date, 
  however, will be either the 8th or the 9th, depending upon where you are in 
  relation to the International Date Line.</p>
