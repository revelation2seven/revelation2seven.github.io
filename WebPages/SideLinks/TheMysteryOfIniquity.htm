<p><font size="+1">As God (the forces of Nature) took the earth in primal times 
  and brought forth humankind, and then many thousands of years later created 
  Adam, so the serpentine force lies at the base of every natural impulse, and 
  governs every natural human instinct and every natural thought. If we are not 
  at one with our emerging higher state of consciousness--the state of Christ 
  Consciousness that has come into the world--we are still one with our own lower, 
  or natural state, as it is written: <i>When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth 
  his own soul</i>. (Ecclesiasticus 21:27). Which is also why the scripture says: 
  <i>And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast...</i>(Revelation 
  13:4). The dragon represents the collective, lower, natural state of mind of 
  the people themselves (fallen man worships himself, and his own intellectual 
  abilities), and <i>the beast</i> in this verse symbolizes that nation, that 
  age-ending political order, which has come up out of the sea in these last times 
  (out of the sea of <i>peoples, and multitudes, and nations and tongues...</i>Revelation 
  17:15), to become the greatest, most powerful empire that has ever existed in 
  the history of the Western world--the United States of America. It represents 
  the nation as well as those who rule over it. <i>Who is like unto the beast? 
  who can make war with him? </i>America is powerful because the people invest 
  it with power, allowing the <i>Beast</i> to rule over them. The serpent, or 
  the devil, governs the nature of this relationship, residing as it does in the 
  heart and mind of man--and, as we can now see, Western man in particular. Why 
  Western man? Because the Law and the Prophets are a Western institution, and 
  <i> where no law is, there is no transgression</i>. (Romans 4:15). In other 
  words only those who claim the Law can be charged with violating it. Only those 
  who proclaim the Gospel can be charged with violating its precepts.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It is no mere coincidence that a psychodrama named <i> Red 
  Dragon</i> is playing in American theaters right now. Those who are able will 
  understand both the deeper significance and the timing. The great spiritual 
  reality is that we are still in the process of being created. (Genesis 1:26). 
  The mind of Adam is only now being brought to perfection--in the great furnace 
  of human affliction if you will. God had to allow humankind, and particularly 
  the mind of Adam in the earth, to descend to a state of total self-realization. 
  And in the process, to a state of God-realization (and that is a Terrible thing) 
  before it could ascend to its own higher place in the natural and spiritual 
  order of things. Every disease, every disorder, every psychosis, every propensity, 
  every latent impulse, every hidden motive, every transgression, every evil potentiality, 
  every human and divine characteristic, as well as every secret thing, had to 
  be brought out into the open, and into the Light of Day...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>The Western Syndicate</b></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Hannibal Lecter...who does he portray? Every twisted psychopathic 
  impulse that we can think of to be sure. But in the world of spiritual matters 
  this Lecter reflects a much darker, more subtle, demonic side of man, that men 
  who make war and kill in the name of Christ cannot fathom, neither in themselves 
  or in those of their ilk--their<i> spiritual cellmates </i>as it were. As the 
  mind thinks the body acts. As those in authority think, the people below behave. 
  There is psychoses, crime and violence in the streets, and among the <i>common</i> 
  people, because those in authority are psychotic killers, and violent criminals 
  themselves. They think they are normal but they are not. They believe that they 
  are the sane ones, but they are the insane ones--they are spiritually insane. 
  Thus it follows, that there is injustice, violence, warfare and murder throughout 
  the world, and it is practiced among the other nations of the earth, because 
  those who have been charged with keeping God's commandments, and with the work 
  of healing the nations, are complicit in murder, theft and injustices themselves. 
  It is a great and spiritually complex thing that has come to pass in history, 
  a great psychological journey into the Mind of the Universe: into the relationship 
  between the Mind of God and the mind of man, Light upon light, Darkness upon 
  darkness, </font><font size="+1">as it is also written: <i>Now be ye transformed

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Zohar too it

    and the Tree of Knowledge were bound together in perfect harmony until Adam 
    came and separated them, thereby giving substance to evil, which had been 
    contained within the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil and was now materialized 
    in the evil instinct. It was Adam therefore who activated the potential concealed 
    within the Tree of Knowledge by separating the two Trees and also by separating 
    the Knowledge from its fruit, which was now detached from its source. This 
    event is called metaphorically 'the cutting of the shoots' and is the archetype 
    of all the great sins mentioned in the Bible, whose common denominator was 
    the introduction of division into the divine unity.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The essence of Adam's 
    sin was that it introduced 'separation above and below' into what should have

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">All of reality flows from the same source: from God. (Genesis 
  1:1). Daytime and Nighttime came into existence with creation, thus Light and 
  Darkness (Isaiah 45:5-7; 1 Thessalonians,chapter 5), and, therefore, both Good 
  and Evil. One set of perceptions flows from the other. (Genesis 1:14-16; Amos 
  5:18; Zephania 1:12... Please see the subchapter entitled <i>Good and Evil</i> 
  in the Addendum to this work). All things emanate from God, as it is written: 
  <i>The way of the wicked is Darkness. They know not at what they stumble. </i>(Proverbs 
  4:19). Think of both Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush, and then the words<i>: 
  God hath formed all things for Himself, even the wicked for the day of evil 
  </i> (Proverbs 16:4).<i> In the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly</i>. 
  (Jeremiah 23:20).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This was essentially the substance of God's revelation to Adam 
  six thousand years ago. It was the spirit of Satan in Adam (the leftover exertions 
  of his own lower nature--uncertainty, confusion, disbelief, ignorance, fear, 
  latent violence, pride and vainglory, things that he did not kill in himself), 
  that convinced him, or rather his seed after him, that this was not so, that 
  somehow there were two forces operating in the universe, one good and the other 
  evil. Those who followed this line of reasoning--the children of Cain--thinking 
  themselves to be the good force became, in essence, the evil force in the earth, 
  and from that point on the (Western) world was divided into two camps: the children 
  of Light and the children of Darkness. (1 Thessalonians 5...KJV). George Bush 
  (one of the great sons of Darkness in the earth), has termed Iraq and Iran, 
  North Korea, and China, his <i>axis of evil. </i>He believes that the Darkness 
  dwells in them, while the Light dwells in him and is watching over <i>his</i> 
  America. (These are the doctrines of <i>antichrist</i>, the doctrines of <i> 
  Ba'al</i> if you will). He cannot begin to comprehend how God (in His most Terrible 
  Form) dwells in all of these other nations of the earth (Romans 13), while evil 
  dwells in him because of his inability to see it. <i>Oh that we were wise, that 
  we understood this</i>...(Deuteronomy 32:29, 39-42; Daniel 12:6,7; Revelation 
  10:5-7). Even though the Mystery of Christ is coming to perfection in America 
  (and could come to perfection in no other place on earth than America), any 
  attempt by America's political and religious leaders to reconcile the doctrines 
  of the American nation with the precepts of Christ, amounts to witchcraft and 
  sorcery.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The spirit of Cain gave rise in time to the spirit of Nimrod, 
  as it is written: <i>He began to be a mighty one in the earth...wherefore it 
  is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord</i>. (Genesis 10:8,9). 
  As God began to set the Mystery of Iniquity upon its political, military, economic, 
  religious and historical base, the spirit of Nimrod, the son of Cush, gave rise 
  to the spirit of Pharaoh. God connected the Mysteries of the Pharaohs to the 
  Mysteries of the True King (Psalm 48:1-3), and set them both on a course back 
  to the Western ends of the earth, and to the fulness of these times, to the 
  place where Cain (the first antichrist) first murdered his brother Abel. (Open 
  the Book of 1 John, KJV).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The spirit of Pharaoh passed into the spirit of the kings of 
  Assyria. The spirit of the Assyrian kings passed into the spirit of the kings 
  of Babylon, prompting Nebuchadnezzar's vision of a Great Tree in the midst of 
  the earth. (Daniel 4). The spirit of these kings passed into the Persians (into 
  the figure of <i>Haman</i> in particular; and this for other prophetic reasons); 
  and from them into the spirit of Alexander the Great and the rulers of Grecia. 
  Thus the words in the Zadokite Document of the Dead Sea Scrolls:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The day on which God will 
    carry out the punishment will be that to which the prophet alluded when he 
    said: 'The princes of Judah have become like them that remove landmarks; I 
    will pour out my wrath upon them like water.' (Hosea 5:10). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    They shall hope for healing, but the blemish shall cling to them. They are 
    all of them apostates in that they have not turned from the way of the treacherous 
    but have sullied themselves with wantonness and with wicked lucre and with 
    nursing of grudges against their fellows and with hatred of their neighbors...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Concerning them God has said: 'Their 
    wine shall prove the poison of serpents and the cruel venom of asps' (Deut.32:33). 
    THE 'WINE' IN QUESTION IS THEIR CONDUCT; THE 'SERPENTS' ARE THE KINGS OF THE 
    NATIONS; AND THE 'VENOM OF ASPS' IS THE CHIEF OF THE GRECIAN KINGS WHO WILL

  may be Alexander and his generals at the beginning of the prophetic narratives, 
  they are the American kings (from the time of Woodrow Wilson to the present

  spoken of at Daniel 8:22 are, Alexander's kingdom; the Roman empire that followed 
  that; the Holy Roman empire that followed that, and finally the American empire 
  that rose up in the earth after that, the most powerful of all, as it is written:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The United States of America is the Eighth world empire to 
  rise up in the Western world to seize upon the oracles of God, and to bring 
  the people of God into captivity--not into physical captivity as we understand 
  such things, but into spiritual captivity. It is the mind of the people that 
  is in chains. (There is no form of slavery more severe than when a captive does 
  not even know he is captive). The American state of mind is, in fact, all that 
  stands between the people and the birth of the True Righteous Nation, and the 
  manifestation of the true Messiahs in our time. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Revelation speaks of the Ten horns and Ten kings which 
  accompany the <i>Beast </i>in its final hour:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the Ten horns which thou sawest are Ten kings, which 
    have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with 
    the Beast.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength 
    unto the Beast.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall 
    overcome them: for He is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are 
    with him are called, and chosen, and faithful...</font></i><font size="+1">(Revelation 
    17:12-14).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It was supposed by many that these Ten kings represented ten 
  members of the European Common Market, until that number grew to 12, and then 
  fifteen. And though there <i>are </i>Ten remaining monarchs, left over from 
  the old ruling order of Europe--England, Belgium, Denmark. Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, 
  Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden--the text in Revelation contains 
  a deeper significance. As there are Ten sefirot on the Tree of Life, and each 
  one a Crown as Paul said: <i>A crown shall he give me in that day</i>, so there 
  are Ten dark sefirot, each of them an image of the sefirot above, and each of 
  them weighing on the complex structure of the mind of Darkness:</font></p>

      were convulsed by the unbalanced force and destroyed. These primordial worlds

      visible form and organization. The third is the abode of darkness. Next 
      follow Seven Hells occupied by those demons which represent incarnate human
