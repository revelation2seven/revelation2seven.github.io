  The &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, novels whose plots revolve around the Rapture 
  now number 40 million in print. &quot;With [George Bush in] the White House, 
  Tom DeLay...in the House of Representatives...these are parts of the righteous 
  army that has finally come into its own.&quot; Rev. Peter Gomes Gary Bauer runs 
  a Washington organization that lobbies for evangelical Christian issues. </p>
<p> (CBS) EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS FORM ONE OF THE MOST POTENT FORCES IN AMERICAN 
  POLITICS AND SOCIETY. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO PLACE THEIR FAITH, A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP 
  WITH JESUS CHRIST, ABOVE EVERYTHING IN THEIR LIVES AND HOPE TO SPREAD THAT GOSPEL 
  TO THE WORLD. An estimated 70 million Americans call themselves evangelicals, 
  and their beliefs have already reshaped American politics. In the last election, 
  40 percent of the votes for George W. Bush came from their ranks, and now those 
  beliefs are beginning to reshape the culture as well -- thanks to a group of 
  best-selling novels known as the &#147;Left Behind&#148; series. </p>
<p>If you want to understand the people behind this political and cultural shift, 
  the place to begin is in church. Correspondent Morley Safer reports. <br>
</p>
<p> &#148;I don't think the media has really caught on to what's been going on 
  in the last 30 years or so in America. An enormous number of people have come 
  to faith in Christ and consider themselves evangelical Christians. AND THESE 
  ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE BUYING, READING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR BOOKS,&#148; SAYS REV. 
  TIM LaHAYE. </p>
<p>LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have written a series of runaway bestsellers known 
  as the &#147;Left Behind&#148; novels. All together, there are 40 million books 
  in print, and another 17 million in spin-offs. Plus, &#147;The Kids&#148; series, 
  audio books and comic books are worth $100 million in annual revenue. </p>
<p>The books give a graphic version of the New Testament prophesy of the end of 
  the world, happening in our time, in which only the righteous are saved. IT'S 
  A TRIUMPHANT TALE--UNMISTAKINGLY CHRISTIAN, UNDENIABLY AMERICAN. </p>
<p>&#147;I THINK IF YOU CUT US, JERRY AND I WOULD BLEED RED, WHITE AND BLUE,&quot; 
  SAYS LaHAYE. &#147;WE BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS RAISED UP AMERICA TO BE A TOOL IN 
  THESE LAST DAYS, TO GET THE GOSPEL TO THE INNERMOST PARTS OF THE EARTH.&#148;...</p>

<p align="center"><b>Malachi, Chapter 4; Hebrews 12...KJV.</b></p>
<p>The &#147;Left Behind&#148; sagas begin with a mysterious event: one third 
  of the passengers on a transatlantic flight suddenly disappear, leaving only 
  their clothes behind. What has happened? IT'S AN EVENT THAT EVANGELICALS CALL 
  THE RAPTURE, where every true-believing Christian, and every child under the 
  age of 12, vanishes in an instant to a better place. All others will face the 
  Tribulation. </p>
<p>&#147;It could happen at any moment. It could happen, as we like to say, during 
  this interview. Like that. Bang,&#148; says Thomas Ice, who might be called 
  a professor emeritus of the Rapture. He runs the Pre-Tribulation Research Center 
  out of his garage in a Dallas suburb. It&#146;s a one-man think-tank funded 
  by LaHaye AND DEDICATED TO PREPARATION FOR THE LAST DAYS ON EARTH. &#147;There 
  is a lot of debate over where &#133; artificial body parts, and contact lenses, 
  and clothes would be &#147;Left Behind&#148; or not. But the body would definitely 
  be taken,&#148; adds Ice. That's what happens to believers. But the rest of 
  humanity is condemned to suffering. </p>
<p>&#147;THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES. There are gonna be many Southern Baptists, 
  for example, or many Presbyterians, or many Catholics, or people who are a part 
  of Christendom,&#148; says Ice. &#147;But if they haven't personally trusted 
  Jesus Christ as their savior, even if they are a lifelong member of a church, 
  you know, then they will be damned.&#148; At the Watermark Community Church 
  in Dallas, Rev. Todd Wagner tells his flock that the books may be fiction, but 
  they are based on hard facts. Non-believers are doomed. </p>
<p>Safer asked Wagner who would be &#147;Left Behind&#148;: &#147;What would be 
  my fate?&#148; &#147;Folks like yourself that are gonna be here, are gonna go 
  through all the events that Christ outlined in Mark:13 and Matthew:24 -- some 
  of which are quite horrific,&#148; says Wagner. &#147;It would be the time of 
  trouble like we&#146;ve never seen before.&#148; For evangelicals, the Rapture 
  and what follows are factual history, history of the future, prophecy. &#147;It&#146;s 
  not a minority view, it's not a group of folks that are niched somewhere over 
  there. It's a very mainstream view,&#148; says Wagner. It&#146;s such a concrete 
  reality that the publishers of the &#147;Left Behind&#148; books can even market 
  a videotape for those who don't make the celestial cut. </p>
<p>People who believe in the Rapture believe the Bible -- WORD FOR LITERAL WORD. 
  &#147;THE BIBLE SAYS WHAT IT MEANS, AND MEANS WHAT IT SAYS,&#148; says Don McWhinney, 
  AN OIL EXECUTIVE FROM DALLAS. 60 Minutes discussed the &#147;Left Behind&#148; 
  books with him and three other evangelicals. And for these readers, the characters 
  in these novels are quite real. </p>
<p>&#147;Will they just take the body and leave the clothes? Watches, and rings, 
  and fillings? Will the whole body be taken? I don't know,&#148; says McWhinney. 
  &#147;But all I know is that God is in control of it. And I have to accept that 
  and believe it. Or I begin to reject it, then it begins to work on my faith 
  in the wrong direction &#133; It would lead to doubt. Doubt is not even an option.&#148; 
  All four evangelical Christians, however, agree that they feel confident that 
  they won&#146;t be &#147;Left Behind&#148;. But do evangelicals think they will 
  live to see the Rapture? &#147;My thinking is I sure hope so. I think it'd be 
  really cool,&#148; says Ice. </p>
<p>Rev. Peter Gomes, a Baptist theologian at Harvard University, is one of this 
  country's preeminent Christian thinkers. He says that the chief source for such 
  belief is a highly controversial book of the Bible: Revelation. &#147;One of 
  the things we know about this book is that it is written in a period of intense 
  persecution of the church. And so the theme that runs through it is what happens 
  to the faithful if they stand up for their faith,&#148; says Gomes. &#147;Terrible 
  things will happen to them in the short term. But in the long run, they will 
  triumph, and those who persecute them will be destroyed.&#148; </p>
<p>Gomes believes that this provides some kind of solace and encouragement to 
  believers in today&#146;s society: &quot;The events of September 11 gave an 
  even greater urgency to believers, and some non-believers.&quot; &#147;I think 
  9/11 was a wake-up call to America. Suddenly, our false sense of security was 
  shaken. And we're vulnerable. And that fear can lead many people to Christ,&#148; 
  says LaHaye, who takes that message around the country. &#148;When Jesus shouts 
  from heaven, there are going to be millions of people taken to heaven, and there 
  will be millions of people who are &#147;Left Behind&#148;.&#148; </p>
<p>&#147;I realize that our message is inherently offensive and divisive, especially 
  in this new age of tolerance. Especially since 9/11,&#148; says Jenkins. &#147;I 
  understand how that sounds. But I'm telling you this &#145;cause I really do 
  believe it.&#148; And Gomes says that belief goes well beyond the pews of churches 
  and the aisles of bookstores. HE SAYS THAT IT'S BOTH A POLITICAL AND CULTURAL 
  MOVEMENT. &#147;Evangelicals have been on the cultural defensive. But they have 
  waited in the wilderness. AND NOW IN THE FULNESS OF TIME, THEY HAVE COME INTO 
  POSSESSION OF WHAT THEY FELT WAS ONCE RIGHTFULLY THEIRS,&#148; says Gomes. </p>
<p>&#147;AND SO, WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, AND TOM DeLAY, AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, TALK RADIO, THE CONSERVATIVE FOX NEWS, ALL THAT SORT OF 
  THING, THESE ARE PARTS OF THE RIGHTEOUS ARMY THAT HAS FINALLY COME INTO ITS 
  OWN.&#148; </p>
<p>Gary Bauer, who once competed with George Bush for the Republican presidential 
  nomination, now runs a Washington organization that lobbies for evangelical 
  Christian issues. He remembers being at the Iowa Republican Presidential debate, 
  when all candidates were asked which political philosopher they most identified 
  with. President Bush said: &#147;Christ, because he changed my heart. WHEN YOU 
  ACCEPT CHRIST AS A SAVIOR, IT CHANGES YOUR HEART. IT CHANGES YOUR LIFE.&#148; 
</p>
<p>HOW IS MR. BUSH DIFFERENT FROM JIMMY CARTER, WHO IS A BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIAN? 
</p>
<p>&#147;When Jimmy Carter began to support abortion or other things, then that 
  became a jarring inconsistency for many of these voters,&#148; says Bauer. &#147;With 
  the president, what he says he believes as a matter of faith also seems to be 
  reflected in many of the policies in his plan to distribute social services 
  through religious institutions.&#148; Other examples include his rejection on 
  gay marriage, his stand on stem cell research &#150; views that fit perfectly 
  into the agenda of the most powerful bloc in the Republican party. </p>
<p>&#147;I'm not accusing my Democratic friends of being ungodly. But I'm just 
  saying statistically, people that attend church frequently, at least once a 
  week or more -- two thirds of them vote Republican,&#148; says Bauer. &#147;Those 
  voters that say they seldom if ever attend religious services, two thirds of 
  them vote Democratic.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p>For evangelicals, the war in Iraq is seen not merely as a war against terror. 
  Last year, Lt. Gen. William Boykin, a deputy undersecretary of defense, and 
  an evangelical, made headlines when he publicly described the war on terror 
  as a religious mission. Of one Muslim warlord, he said, &quot;MY GOD IS BIGGER 
  THAN HIS. MY GOD IS A REAL GOD.&quot; </p>
<p>A lot of people are uncomfortable with the Bush administration, and its cozy 
  relationship with church and state. But Bauer disagrees. &#147;I don't see it. 
  I don't know why they're uncomfortable. Nobody in America is being told how 
  to worship,&#148; says Bauer. </p>
<p>But in a country that is home to millions of Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Christians 
  who believe otherwise, such exclusivity can take on the appearance of extremism, 
  ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ADD POLITICS AND PATRIOTISM TO THE GOSPELS. </p>
<p>&#147;The trouble with evangelicalism of a certain stripe in America is that 
  it's been so long from power that IT IS SEDUCED BY POWER. And once it gets it, 
  it is very hard to distinguish secular power from spiritual power,&#148; says 
  Gomes. </p>
<p>These are heady times for evangelicals: AN ELECTION YEAR, WITH ONE OF THEIR 
  OWN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, the final book in the &#147;Left Behind&#148; series 
  to be published in March, and, of course, always the chance, even hope, OF THAT 
  GREATEST EVENT, THE RAPTURE. &#147;Not everybody who thinks they know what's 
  going to happen knows,&#148; says Gomes. &#147;So, I'm willing to take my chances, 
  not with the evangelicals, but with the Lord. I'm going to place my hands in 
  his.&#148;</p>
