    Apocalypse</i>, <i>The Year of Release</i>, or <i>Coming to the Birth</i>. 
    In the same manner as every child is conceived in the secret of its own mother's 
    womb, and grows until it can no longer contain itself within the confines 
    and darkness of its own surroundings, so the present, emerging state of human 
    consciousness was anciently conceived into the world. In nature's mix of fire 
    and water, air and earth (the life-giving substance of our own maternal environment), 
    the child develops, its parts appear, its history unfolds. Then one day the 
    world in which this unborn child resides begins to tremble, more than ever 
    before (its institutions begin to collapse). The infant feels itself being 
    moved beyond its own control in the direction of the event--a narrow place 
    from which light begins to appear. The light grows brighter, until at once 
    the child is delivered. And so it is with this present generation. We are 
    being swept along in a great historical process that can have no other outcome 
    but the birth of this Child (Revelation 12:1,2). Nor can we exercise &quot;choice&quot; 
    in the matter, because if the Child will not be born in a multitude it will 
    be born in a remnant, and still grow up to fill the world with its presence 
    (Daniel 2:44).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">But it is a bloody event. Our view of this light, 
    is all filtered through the color red, and naturally so (Isaiah 63:1-4; 66:6-19; 
    Matthew 16:1-4). As it is with the birth of every human child so is it with 
    the birth of the world. And just as the Divine Mother gave birth to the present 
    age two thousand years ago, She is now descending again and giving birth to 
    the coming age. She is also delivering it out of Her own lower parts--here 
    at the Western ends of the earth. (It is a Great Mystery, one that will be 
    understood in the process itself...Micah 4:9,10). It is a Child already wise 
    in the ways of human nature, but also in the ways of God. Though hidden as 
    God is in the garments of Their own creation, They are at the same time visible 
    to those who can see. They are visible in history--in the sum of every natural, 
    and every human event--and now<i> cleary</i> visible in all the events that 
    are unfolding in the world at this present time. </font></p>

    <p>JUBILEE PARTNERS...has been a dream for years at the older Koinonia Partners 
      community in southwest Georgia. In the spring of 1979 it took <i>root</i> 
      in 258 acres of beautiful meadows, fields, and forest in northeast Georgia. 
      A small group from Koinonia pitched their tents on the new land. The sounds 
      of construction have been echoing ever since as one new building follows 
      another.</p>
    <p>Soon another part of the dream also began to take shape. From the first 
      we had found inspiration in the words of Jesus' sermon on the Isaiah text 
      about THE YEAR OF JUBILEE...&quot;good news for the poor...release for prisoners...recovery

    Release) will not actually happen in anyone's lifetime (much less our own), 
    but rather in some far-off distant time in the future--always carries the 
    day. So why even prepare for such an event? Why even consider it, or focus 
    the whole weight of discussion in that direction? Why take the time to study 
    the broad sweeping chapters of Isaiah themselves, or even try to place them 
    in the context of present world events, or in the context of the other social 
    and economic precepts that must be enacted into the life-stream of any people 
    who would be so bold as to actually wish others free, not only <i>from</i> 
    economic oppression but from the collective effects of their own lack of understanding 
    and historic insight as well). The world is passing out of Darkness into Light, 
    and economic homeostasis is the ultimate goal, wherein no part of the world 
    is being made mindful, or affected by the disease of injustice in any other 
    part of the world. This will happen only when the precepts under which man 
    guides himself are in perfect accord with the precepts and mandates of Heaven--with 
    the Tao of absolute justice and true righteousness. (No compromises and half-way

    and relationships, not profit and quantity,&quot; and when she outlines the 
    simple natural requirement that local people maintain--not control as we understand 
    such things in our present economy, but stewardship over local resources, 
    and especially where she requires such communities to continually assess and 
    respond to the effects of their activities on those around them and on the 
    world at large. But her foot gets caught in the trap of this present age (the 
    present paradigm), and we all get caught in it together, when she ties this 
    forward thrust of the spirit to the activities of the American banking system. 
    This giant (indeed, the entire idea of banking itself) cannot proceed, no 
    not even in its finest set of peace beads and new age garments. No, not even 
    if it put on sackcloth and mourned its own complicity in all of the economic 
    crimes that have been committed upon humanity and the environment these last

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nothing props up the economy 
      more than consumers, and dips in their spending frighten forecasters. But 
      that is all that has happened in recent years--dips, not plunges. Consumers 
      in America spend because they feel they must spend. More than in the past, 
      the <i>necessities</i> of life, real and perceived, eat up their incomes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That treadmill spending is good 
      news for the economy. As recovery takes hold, the biggest threat to its 
      survival would be a downturn in consumer spending. That is not inconceivable: 
      The support for recent spending--the household cash generated through mortgage 
      refinancings and tax cuts--is disappearing and a new source of cash, from 
      many new jobs and many new paychecks is not yet a reality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But do not worry, various experts 
      say. Consumers will keep spending anyway, GOING DEEPER INTO DEBT TO DO SO 
      IF THEY MUST. They have too many needs, some that were luxuries only yesterday. 
      A second car and child care, for example, are now necessities for millions 
      of households with two earners commuting to jobs...</font></p>

    in various parts of the world. There is even some plan afoot in government 
    and banking to reemerge after a nuclear, or some other apocalyptic event with 
    a new supply of currency (electronic or otherwise)--which it will <i>naturally</i>

<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These are 
    the real causes of war, and it is chimerical to try to lay the foundation 
    of peace without removing them first. It is doubly chimerical to build peace 
    on economic foundations which, in turn, rest on the systematic cultivation 
    of greed and envy, the very forces which drive men into conflict. </font>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How could we even begin to disarm 
      greed and envy? Perhaps by being much less greedy and envious ourselves; 
      perhaps by resisting the temptation of letting our luxuries become needs; 
      and perhaps by even scrutinizing our needs to see if they cannot be simplified 
      and reduced. If we do not have the strength to do any of this, could we 
      perhaps stop applauding the type of economic 'progress' which palpably lacks 
      the basis of permanence and give what modest support we can to those who, 
      unafraid of being denounced as cranks, work for non-violence: as conservationists, 
      ecologists, protectors of wildlife, promoters of organic agriculture, distributists, 
      cottage producers and so forth? An ounce of practice is generally worth 
      more than a ton of theory.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It will need many ounces, however, 
      to lay the economic foundations of peace. Where can one find the strength 
      to go on working against such obviously appalling odds? What is more: where 
      can one find the strength to overcome the violence of greed, envy, hate 
      and lust within oneself? I think Gandhi had the answer: 'There must be recognition 
      of the existence of the soul apart from body, and of its permanent nature, 
      and this recognition must amount to a living faith; and in the last resort, 
      non-violence does not avail those who do not possess a living faith in the 
      God of Love.'&quot; </font>Small Is Beautiful, by E.F. Schumacher, p.40<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Economics...deals with 
      goods in accordance with their market value, and not in accordance with 
      what they really are. The same rules and criteria are applied to primary 
      goods, which man has to win from nature, and secondary goods, which presuppose 
      the existence of primary goods and are manufactured from them. All goods 
      are treated the same, because the point of view is fundamentally that of 
      private profit-making, and this means that it is inherent in the methodology 
      of economics to ignore man's dependence on the natural world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another way of stating this is 
      to say that economics deals with goods and services from the point of view 
      of the market, where willing buyers meets willing seller. The buyer is essentially 
      a bargain hunter; he is not concerned with the origin of the goods or the 
      conditions under which they have been produced. His sole concern is to obtain 
      the best value for his money.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The market therefore represents 
      only the surface of society and its significance relates to the monetary 
      situation as it exists there and then. There is no probing into the depths 
      of things, into the natural or social facts that lie behind them. In a sense 
      the market is the institutionalization of individualism and non-responsibility. 
      Neither buyer or seller is responsible for anything but himself. It would 
      be 'uneconomic' for a wealthy seller to reduce his prices to poor customers 
      merely because they are in need, or for a wealthy buyer to pay an extra 
      price merely because the supplier is poor. Equally it would be 'uneconomic' 
      for a buyer to give preference to home-produced goods if imported goods 
      are cheaper. He does not, and is not expected to, accept responsibility 
      for the country's balance of payments.&quot; </font>p.46<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
      </font></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Economics operates legitimately 
      and usefully within a 'given' framework which lies altogether outside the 
      economic calculus. We might say that economics does not stand on its own 
      two feet, or that it is a 'derived' body of thought--derived from meta-economics. 
      If the economist fails to study meta-economics, or, even worse, if he remains 
      unaware of the fact that there are boundaries to the applicability of the 
      economic calculus, he is likely to fall into a similar kind of error as 
      that of certain medieval theologians who tried to settle questions of physics 
      by means of biblical quotations. Every science is beneficial within its 
      proper limits, but becomes evil and destructive as soon as it transgresses 
      them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The science of economics is 'so 
      prone to usurp the rest'--even moreso today than it was 150 years ago, when 
      Edward Coplestone pointed to this danger--because it relates to certain 
      strong drives of human nature, such as envy and greed. All the greater is 
      the duty of its experts, the economists, to understand and clarify its limitations, 
      that is to say, to understand meta-economics.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What then is meta-economics? 
      As economics deals with man in his environment, we may expect that meta-economics 
      consists of two parts--one dealing with man and the other dealing with the 
      environment. In other words, we may expect that economics must derive its 
      aims and objectives from a study of man, and that it must derive at least 
      a large part of its methodology from the study of NATURE.&quot; </font>pp.48,49<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Now the lenders (the bankers, and, of course, the agencies 
    of government that exist solely on their behalf, and which are in turn subject 
    to them) are either our brothers, or they are strangers oppressing us (and 
    most often in the name of our own beliefs). They do profess the religion of 
    Abraham, do they not? For pity sakes, they do not even treat each other as 
    brethren (except when they are in collusion with each other), how much less 
    the rest of us? and this is how they operate: They lend into public use the 
    amount we have borrowed from them, but they do not issue into public use the 
    amount we actually owe. They place the amount of the <i>principle</i> into 
    circulation but not the amount of the <i>interest</i>. Thus there is only 
    so much money available, enough theoretically for every soul to pay back the 
    collective principle of our debts...but where do we all go to find the interest 
    that we also owe? This extra amount of money does not in fact exist. So we 
    are left to compete against each other for it, from the principle amount of 
    money that is in circulation. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The strongest, the most cunning, and the most willing, have 
    no trouble competing for it (they just keep their hearts and minds closed 
    to the implications of it all). We, however, see their branch banks and businesses, 
    office buildings, hotels and chain stores springing up everywhere, desecrating 
    the land (not to mention their old smokestacks and factories rusting away), 
    and we see their houses and estates springing up everywhere, further attesting 
    to the ongoing, mindless assault upon the natural world that is underway in 
    America today. Where do these privileged get the money (the interest) to keep 
    their own private economies intact and circulating? From the rest of society--by 
    constantly exploiting the limits of the economy, by manipulation and fine 
    tuning the amount one can charge for goods and services, and for labor. Thus 
    from the disenfranchised (those without economic power), and from those who 
    have dropped out of the cycle because they either cannot, or will not, compete 
    (these are called the poor and the poor-in-spirit). They prosper at the expense 
    of others who must remain content to live with depressed wages (and depressed 
    opportunities) from week to week (or perhaps even from loan to loan), to finance 
    the lives and lifestyles of those above them. (Those who support the ones 
    above them have traditionally been known as the working class, but even this 
    class is changing into something else as some of its children fall out of 
    it to levels of uncertain subsistence, and others give themselves over to 
    the materialism and tactics of those above them and disappear upwards). And, 
    of course, they extract this means from the gargantuan assault upon the natural 
    environment that is steadily underway across the land, simply because they 
    have acquired the power to do so.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The employer then takes the other five dollars (times all 
    the workers in his employ) and goes home--to a different neighborhood. He 
    pays the interest on his loans, he expands, and he increases the state of 
    his own economic well-being, at every one else's expense. (The impoverished 
    state of the world's peoples is the product of this system multiplied by the 
    millions who are prospering at the expense of the billions). The capitalist 
    even competes against his own class because this is the nature of the beast. 
    He has no spiritual affections. He competes and competes, he builds and builds, 
    until at last the whole house falls down. <i>And great was the fall of it...</i>(Matthew 
    7:24-27). It will happen because it is the plan of history. God built the 
    towers so that we could see them, and so that we could see them fall. Why? 
    So that we would learn to never build them again. How else could we understand 
    without the experience? (Even now, as we rewrite this paper, plans are unfolding 
    to replace the World Trade Center with another, 1,700 feet tall). </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the other central 
    banks, realizes that there must be a certain amount of cooperation in the 
    market to insure growth, and a certain amount of growth to keep the house 
    of cards they have built from falling. If there is not--if there is no public 
    incentive to keep borrowing (keeping the limited money supply in flux between 
    the bank, the public, and back to the bank again), fueling, so-to-say, the 
    steady fires of development needed to keep everything in motion--then people 
    will wake up one day and realize that there (really) is only so much money 
    out here between us and that we have been at each other's throats to get at 
    it. It is evident when we answer an ad in the newspaper and find twenty others 
    sitting in the company's employment office, applying for the same position. 
    We do not speak to each other, or wish each other well, because we know we 
    are competing for the same job--for the same limited amount of money in circulation--and 
    our love for each other is diminished by how much we need or want this job...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">And we learn that there is not enough money in circulation 
    (by the amount of money that is being skimmed off the top of the economy by 
    the rich and powerful, by the amount of interest on the sum of all loans that 
    are being repaid, and by the amount of savings that are being kept out of 
    circulation in violation of the sacred precept, <i>Give us this day, O God, 
    our daily bread</i>), to stop the chain effect of monetary collapse when once 
    it is underway. It will not come to a halt like the old un-grinding of a locomotive, 
    but like a skipped beat, an alarming pulse, and then suddenly the lights blink 
    and an entire government collapses into default. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">If those nations, notably Japan, which bankroll America's 
    enormous debt, should decide to take their investments offshore (or if Japan's 
    economy itself should collapse), precipitating a fiscal and poltical crisis 
    of unimaginable magnitude in Washington, the government will either have to 
    close down (unable to pay its bills) or convince the American people that 
    it is still (electronic) business as usual, and that nothing of apocalyptic 
    proportions was happening. Of course it will have to enact the strongest economic 
    measures possible, including the suspension or dismantling of its own constitutional 
    framework. (Already underway). Those who resist, or who refuse to comply with 
    the other authoritative measures that must accompany such an event, will be 
    called the enemies of the people (not &quot;communists&quot; anymore, but 
    some other new-coined threat, a red scare nevertheless). Among them will be 
    the sons and daughter of God, the Remnant in this generation. (Romans 8:19-28). 
    Those who do not sense the import of this crisis, who do not resist, will 
    be violating the law of the Great Sabbath (Hebrews 4), and exchanging their 
    birthright for <i>one morsel of meat</i>. (Hebrews 12:12-17...KJV). The banks, 
    meanwhile, begin foreclosures on outstanding loans to satisfy their depositors 
    (who are demanding to know where there money is). Even the collateral the 
    banks seize in place of money will become a burden, because it will be of 
    little value until the crisis is over. And through the confusion, the panic, 
    and the demand for order, we realize that Nature (God) Herself is foreclosing 
    on the giant. She is taking back what men have stolen from Her, and from Her 
    children (Jeremiah 7:9,10).</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Capitalism (and American capitalism in particular), was built 
    upon unsound principles--completely out of harmony with Nature's laws--and 
    upon an ever-evolving assumption that it would always stand, that it would 
    never be called into account, and that it was too powerful a system to collapse. 
    This was all the work of a Dark mentality which, from the beginning, has been 
    deprived of the light of Divine Reason and of the ability to see into its 
    own future. Thus in the interest of continued economic growth, when it is 
    not interfering politically and militarily abroad (to assure <i>international 
    stability</i>)...</font></p>

    as well as other material and psychological conditions at home. It does so 
    in accordance with its own complex interpretation (well, it wants us to imagine 
    that it is all so naturally complex that the process must always be entrusted 
    to those who are trained and disposed to such matters, like priests in the 
    temple--other bankers and professional economists--who understand the meanings) 
    of the index of economic factors as it moves from day to day, month to month, 
    and region to region. Thus it exercises a vast, <i> diabolical </i>power over 
    the personal lives and well-being of every soul in the nation, no, in the 
    world. Those who acquire this power are able to remove funds from one sector 
    of the economy (by manipulating interest rates, thus the supply of money...or 
    by shifting investments), thus upsetting the lives of many thousands upon 
    thousands while creating a boon for others. Thus the money keeps flowing from 
    the banks--we get to touch what little comes our way--and back again, while 
    the vast toll of human misery continues. We can't measure all of the misery 
    at home, because much of it is hidden behind the doors of regular working 
    people, and passes for normal family life, but we see enough of it to understand. 
    The capitalist economy, and the banking profession that empowers it, has no

<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"></div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While the exact origins 
      of money are unknown, all its earlier forms were deeply related to the mysteries 
      of the sacred, and its first role was as a symbol. A symbol is 'something 
      which represents something else which is immaterial or abstract,' according 
      to the Oxford English Dictionary, which goes on to point out that all early 
      symbols were related to religious concepts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the oldest coins is a 
      Sumerian bronze piece dating back to about 3200 BC. On one side of the coin 
      is a representation of a sheaf of wheat, and on the other is a representation 
      of Inanna (the Ishtar of the Babylonians), the Goddess of life, death, and 
      fertility. It was called a &quot;shekel,&quot; and it was a sacred symbol 
      embodying the mysteries of life's fertility. The shekel is by no means atypical. 
      Throughout history, virtually every society has conferred some mysterious 
      sacred qualities on its currency. More than 2500 years after the Sumerian 
      shekel, the first Greek coins were actually tokens given to citizens as 
      proof of payment of their dues. These tokens could be redeemed for participation 
      in the annual hecatomb or sacred meal to be shared with the deities.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Arab scholar Ibn Khaldrun 
      claimed that &quot;God created the two precious metals, gold and silver, 
      to serve as a measure of all commodities.&quot; Without further need for 
      intervention by any religious institution, gold and silver remained symbolically 
      associated respectively with the sun and moon. For centuries, their prices 
      stabilized mysteriously in a fixed ration of 1/13.5, astrologically determined 
      to reflect the heavenly cycles. The two metals remained divinely ordained 
      currencies after the astrological justification was long forgotten. There 
      are many people who, to this day, claim that 'real' money would be a return 
      to the gold standard. Some even keep invoking biblical origins...</font></p>

      quotations illustrate this perfectly. The first is my favorite Allan Greenspan 
      witticism: 'If you have understood me, then I must not have made myself

  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If a friend were to offer you 
      a choice between a $20 note and a piece of paper on which was written, &quot;I 
      promise to pay $20 to the bearer of this note,&quot; which would you prefer? 
      You may know your friend as a sterling and trustworthy person. But if you 
      try to exchange the little chit at the hardware store for a new garden hose, 
      the assistant wont take it. Even if they also know your friend, they will 
      be concerned about the shop's ability to pay its suppliers with the note. 
      So naturally you would prefer the $20 note, because lifelong experience 
      has taught you that the $20 note will be accepted by everyone as worth $20. 
      You have a deeply held belief--and here is the key--not that the $20 note 
      is valuable (after all, its only a piece of paper), but that everyone else 
      will accept it as valuable. It really doesn't matter what you think about 
      your money, you still know that you can spend it. You believe that everyone 
      else believes that the money is valuable. What you are talking about is 
      a belief about a belief.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Matters of belief and social 
      convention can be powerful and practically indestructible. History abounds 
      in examples of people who have chosen torture and death rather than change 
      their beliefs. We also recognize that someone can choose to continue believing 
      something, even when faced with ample evidence to the contrary. So belief 
      has a formidable presence in the human psyche...Moreover, a chain of belief 
      about a belief is only is strong as its weakest link. If I think that someone 
      on the other side of the world has stopped believing in the Mexican peso, 
      the Thai baht, or the Russian rouble, then I have to fear that his neighbors 
      will stop believing. As a result the whole house of cards may fall down, 
      as it did for Mexico in 1994, for Thailand in 1997, or for Russia in 1998.</font></p>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In brief, the game of money, exactly 
    like the Ancient Greek oracles, is a confidence game. Whenever the emperor 
    has no clothes (i.e. whenever a 'crisis of confidence' looms), those in the 
    know hope that no guileless child will make an improper remark. Under such 
    circumstances, a facade of regal confidence, mystery, decorum, and ritual 
    serves to ensure that a long and fragile chain of beliefs will hold.</font></div>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHY MONEY IS NOT A THING </font> 
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We should now dissipate a key 
      illusion in the magic about money: money is not a thing. </font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For most of history, money has 
      definitely appeared to be a thing, in fact, an incredible variety of things. 
      Without even mentioning the most recently prevailing forms of money, such 
      as paper, gold, silver, or bronze, Glyn Davies created a full money alphabet 
      with a small selection of objects that served as symbolic of value: amber, 
      beads, cowries, drums, eggs, feathers, gongs, hoes, ivory, jade, kettles, 
      leather, mats, nails, oxen, pigs, quartz, rice, salt, thimbles, umiaks, 
      wampums, yarns and zappozats, which are decorated axes.</font></p>
    
  </div>
  <div align="left">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Interestingly, a simple thought 
      experiment can separate the aura of money from any or all of these things. 
      Let us assume that you are stranded alone on a deserted island. If, when 
      you were left stranded, you had a thing in your pocket - say a knife - that 
      knife will still be useful as a knife on your island. Now you may take with 
      you a million dollars in money in this fantasy, and you may have it in any 
      form you like...even any of the forms of the alphabet money that strikes 
      your fancy. Whatever form you choose, on your island that money changes 
      into paper, plastic, metal or whatever else, but it has ceased to be money.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Events in recent decades have 
      further made evident the non-material nature of money. In 1971, the United 
      States ceased to define the value of the dollar in terms of gold. Since 
      that time, the dollar has represented a promise from the US government to 
      redeem the dollar with--another dollar. At least when the dollar was backed 
      with gold, we could more easily believe it had some objective value. With 
      the demise of the gold-dollar equivalency, such self-deception has become 
      more difficult.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For another analogy 
    of money and magic--no magician's routine is complete without a disappearing 
    act. Money has been performing this feat in a rather spectacular way. Once 
    upon a time, when money was mostly gold and silver coins, banks started issuing 
    pieces of paper that stated where the metal was kept. The sentence &quot;I 
    will pay the bearer the sum of one Pound Sterling&quot; which adorns the Pound 
    bill is still a reminder of the weight and silver content of the metal currency. 
    The next step in the disappearing act is already well under way. The vast 
    majority of paper money has further dematerialized into binary bits in computers 
    belonging to our bankers, brokers, or other financial institutions, and there 
    is serious talk that all of it may soon join the virtual world. Should we 
    wait until the last paper bill has disappeared into a cyber-purse to wake 
    up to the true non-material nature of money?</font></div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A WORKING DEFINITION OF MONEY</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our working definition 
    of money can now be very straight forward. Money is an agreement, within a 
    community, to use something as a means of payment. Each one of these terms 
    is essential in this definition. Seen as an agreement, money has much in common 
    with other social contracts, such as political parties, nationality, or marriage. 
    These constructs are real, even if they exist only in people's minds. The 
    money agreement can be attained formally or informally, freely or coerced, 
    consciously or unconsciously...Money as an agreement is always valid only 
    within a given community. Some currencies are operational only among small 
    groups of friends...for certain periods of time, or among the citizens of 
    one particular nation. Such a community can be an entire global community...</font></div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MONEY SHIFTS AND POWER SHIFTS</font></p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Money is, therefore, 
    much more than a technical issue. Whenever a currency is accepted within a 
    community, it makes an implicit statement about power in that community. So 
    when priests or priestesses were in power, temples issued money. When kings 
    dominated, Aristotle attributed to them personally the 'Sovereign right to 
    issue currency.' In the Industrial Age nation-states became the paragon of 
    power, so national currencies automatically became dominant.</font></div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that power is starting to 
      shift away from the nation-states, it should not come as a surprise that 
      new non-national currencies are emerging. Some people still assume that 
      there is only one kind of money possible in the modern world--the familiar 
      national currency, in the form of bills and coins. Of course, the magicians's 
      trick concerning money is to make us believe that we need the magician's 
      help to create money. This is not true, unless we choose to take sleight 
      of hand for reality...&quot; </font>The Future of Money, by Bernard Lietaer,

  <p><font size="+1">Every soul is born into the world with all the money it needs 
    to get from one side of life to the other. It is rich at birth. Real money 
    (the only true medium of exchange) is &quot;work performed/services rendered,&quot; 
    that's it, period. If everyone got up and went to work today just as they 
    always do, but accepted no pay for it, and if they were still able to go to 
    the store and pick up the things they needed, and found them there as usual, 
    and if everyone suddenly developed the social resolve and made all the intellectual 
    and spiritual adjustments necessary to implement such an economy, and if everyone 
    else outside of this economy was educated and enfranchised into it--every 
    soul equal to the other in each other's eyes (the greatest among us, the teachers 
    and physicians, the poets and the artists, our servants)--the True-Money economy 
    would be immediately in place. Of course the present world economy stands 
    directly in the way of such realities and therefore the great economic judgments 
    that are already underway.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(At a Rainbow Family gathering in the Upper Peninsular of 
    Michigan a few years ago, our granddaughter, Kalila, with a pocket full of 
    change and a few dollar bills, took a stroll with the other children down 
    the main path--on their own--hoping to buy some of the handmade beads and 
    jewelry things that were on display along the way. She came back about an 
    hour later and threw all her cash down, exclaiming: &quot;This stuff is no 
    good around here.&quot; No one along the way would trade for it. &quot;You 
    can trade for other things,&quot; we told her, &quot;something that you made 
    with your own hands, something with love in it, something that they would 
    like, or perhaps you could see if there was something you could help them 
    with...some work that they needed help with.&quot; It was her first lesson 
    in <i>real</i> economics--a simple and rudimentary lesson to be sure, one 
    not fraught with the initial complexities that will present themselves in 
    the worldwide implementation of such a true economy--but a first lesson nevertheless).</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Real money can also consist of a promise, or a token representing 
    a promise, by one person to perform so much work in exchange for another persons 
    goods and services. But the work or the actual item traded is the money, not 
    the token used to symbolize the exchange. The token, or the currency, becomes 
    money only when we lose our grasp on its meaning, when we mistake it for real 
    money. When we mistake the tokens or the currency-in-use (dollars or whatever) 
    for real money, the ones who create the tokens and print the currency get 
    to be in charge of the whole economy and, in the process, of every one lives 
    and well-being as well. There are historical factors (spiritual lessons) leading 
    up to our present world economy and we want to understand them, so that we 
    do not recreate them.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The capitalist system does not operate on real-money. It 
    performs no real work. There is a lot of paper currency (and now plastic) 
    in circulation which capitalists print, which passes as money, and seems like 
    money, but it is not real money. It is, in fact, worthless unless it can be 
    exchanged for something of <i>real</i> value. The wealthy do not produce anything 
    of <i>real</i> value, others do. And when they actually get their hands on 
    the levers of real production it is always in the sole interest of amassing 
    further wealth, more power to protect that wealth; and their methods are always 
    (always) grounded in the exploitation of others and the continual and ceaseless 
    assault upon the Earth and her precious resources...</font></p>

      Americans in the South to rebuild churches that had been burned in the struggle 
      for civil rights in the sixties. He created the country's first community 
      land trust to provide farmland for African_American farmers in Georgia. 
      Years later, he designed and built affordable housing for the community 
      land trust in Great Barrington. He pioneered the movement for local currencies. 
      IN 1980 he founded the E. F. Schumacher Society to put the decentralist

    to the Laws that were received and passed down by their first parents), but 
    who have also justified the commission of war and the otherwise taking of 
    human life in the exercise of this power. In the West he is all the Gentile, 
    Jewish, Christian and Islamic (and even Hindu) peoples who have come to positions 
    of political and economic authority in these last times. It is what Paul meant 
    when speaking of Adam and Eve: <i>This is a great mystery</i>, he said, <i>but 
    I am (really) speaking of Christ and the Church. </i>(Ephesians 5:30-32...KJV). 
    In essence, Paul is referring to the last two thousand years of Western history. 
    Eve is a literary figure of the Church (the great Congregation), and she has 
    brought forth in the earth a multitude of those who are like Cain, her firstborn, 
    who fight and kill to preserve what they have stolen, lands and wealth which 
    they have come to believe is rightfully theirs. (James 4). She has also brought 
    forth those who are like Abel, who will not kill and who do not make war in

      them against God...He persuaded men to ascribe their strength and happiness 
      to their own courage. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny--seeing 
      no other way of turning men from the fear of God, but to bring them into 
      a constant dependence upon his power. He also said he would be revenged 
      on God (Romans 13:1-5) if he should have a mind to drown the world again, 
      for he would build a tower too high for the waters to reach...The multitude

      gang, whose savage manners...obtained him the title of Chief among plunderers.</font>&quot; 
      T'was Seeding Time, by J. Ruth.</p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font size="+1">Nimrod is the biblical figure of the strong leader. Paine, 
    however, failed to see this <i>familiar spirit</i> rising up in the merchant 
    leaders of the American Revolution, or in the person of the American presidents. 
    What is the saying? &quot;One can not see the trees for the forest.&quot; 
    (Matthew 7:16-23; Mark 8:22-25). From the beginning, Nimrod was able to consolidate 
    the uncertainties men entertained about natural and human events (their inabilities 
    to see into the spiritual world) against the people themselves. And after 
    all these thousands of years, this same spirit was able to more fully capitalize 
    on man's descent to these Western ends of the earth. These final historical 
    events are known in the Prophets as <i>the Great Falling Away</i> (2 Thessalonians, 
    chapter 2; Hebrews 6:4-8...KJV). Such things had to occur, however, not only 
    in order for us to finally grasp the principles upon which the world was created 
    (the higher Dialectic--Thesis, Antithesis, and the final spiritual Synthesis), 
    but in order for us to <i>freely and knowingly choose</i> to return to the 
    simple economic relationships we all shared before the rise of Cain and Nimrod 
    in the earth (but now at an exquisitely higher plain of human consciousness). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">What could have happened to destroy those relationships? 
    It certainly had to do with the delineation at some time or another of tribal 
    borders (the earliest stages of nationalism), and the eventual introduction 
    of weights and measures, but even before these there was the evolutionary 
    issues of human nature itself--psychological, intellectual and moral, ethical, 
    and finally spiritual. For what does it mean to be created in the image of 
    God? What does it mean to become a true human being? (I want to believe that 
    we have finally attained to that stage--out of the Darkness into the Light--that 
    we are no longer a species of...well, <i>golems, droids</i> and <i>orcs</i>,

    put his mark on it. Or perhaps a priestly class was empowered in the transaction, 
    some esteemed figure before whom the two appeared, as a witness between them, 
    and a sacred symbol common to all, and understood for its power, was inscribed 
    on the stone. The mark gave this stone a special meaning among all other stones, 
    and was invested not only with the promise of an individual but with the word 
    of the tribe or the group. In some such way as this was (un-real) token-money 
    created--but in reality, in a breach of trust. (The <i>Fall</i> of man, and 
    history itself was underway...The Capitalist order is still thousands of years 
    in the future). Of course, where a level of trust was still present a stick 
    or some other personal item could serve as well. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Of importance, however, is the fact that the debtor issued 
    his own <i>money</i>. (We will assume for now that the <i>Strongman</i>, Nimrod, 
    has not appeared on the scene yet. There is no temple yet in the center of 
    the province. The doctrines of Adam and the spirit of Cain are not yet abroad 
    in the earth...Genesis 1:26). It is soon understood that others in the group 
    will actually accept the stone in exchange for their own labors, as long as 
    they felt confident they could redeem it again, or eventually bring it back 
    to the person who first issued it, to be paid in kind. If it had the mark 
    of the tribe or the group on it, then there were further social pressures 
    in place to assure that the stone maintained its integrity. And before long 
    a person with one of these stones in their bag, while on a journey to visit 
    another clan or tribe, met another on the way to visit their own tribe. Perhaps 
    the other had a token with a mark on it also, which he acquired in the village 
    to which our sojourner was heading. And so they traded these objects assuring 
    each other they could be redeemed for certain necessities in the place they 
    were going. (Of course it is difficult here not to give some passing thought 
    to the idea of the <i>first profession</i>, and its impact on the political 
    and religious development of a given people). </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Perhaps good relationships began to ensue, along with further 
    and more sophisticated means of keeping and transferring such accounts between 
    more-distant groups. Token-money in this sense may have led to a certain level 
    of expansion in human relationships--a certain amount of good out of a certain 
    amount of, let us say, not-good. Not-good because it was also leading to the 
    early rise of a trading or merchant class. (The <i>fall</i> continues). Soon 
    alliances were being <i>forged</i> between groups (ah, a hint of political 
    authority, the language of power begins to appear). Perhaps things fell out 
    between groups, and the tokens between them ceased to be honored. The tokens, 
    we realize, began to acquire a power of their own, a power that affected human 
    relationships in every future way. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Other complexities began to emerge as relationships began 
    to expand and <i>civilization</i> as we know it began to emerge. &quot;How 
    authentic are these tokens?&quot; some surely reasoned. &quot;How do we know 
    that you did not make them on your way here, or that they can actually be 
    redeemed for real things on the other side? After all, such stones can be 
    picked up anywhere&quot; (As long as trade was confined to the realm of barter, 
    meat for axes, seeds for skins, firewood for woolen sweaters, a general stability 
    ensued--it was all more or less related to time--but when token-money was 
    introduced, along with the possibilities of making a profit [on other peoples' 
    labors as well] entered the equation, economic instability was a natural result). 
    So it became necessary that cash--our promises to provide goods and services 
    at a future date, or at another place--be made from materials that are not 
    so easy to pick up along the way, something whose value (whether real or imagined) 
    men can commonly agree on...such as metals. For theoretically, if some debtor 
    refused to redeem the coins, the coins themselves could be forged into a sword 
    to attack him and take by force what he would not yield peaceably. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Cash became not only a medium of exchange but a means of 
    communication between peoples. Commerce became the language. A person from 
    an hundred, or a thousand miles away in those times, could not pick up the 
    phone (or log on the computer) to see if the promise is really good. The token, 
    then, was a long-distance way of saying, &quot;yes, our promise is good.&quot; 
    If a person's word, however (honesty that is, and personal integrity), is 
    a form of cash, and it is, we can return to it. And in some collective sense 
    we already are, but not in the way that we ultimately will. (A whole <i>wicked</i> 
    capitalist world has gotten in the way between us, between those of us with 
    real money--talents, skills and labor, organizational abilities and spiritual 
    resolve--and those we wish to serve). Our energies are presently being absorbed 
    in <i>the system</i>, and diffused in a form of currency (the dollar, the 
    pound, the Euro and the Yen) that does not find its way to those places we 
    want it directed--which, when the house falls, can be brought back to the 
    banks and exchanged for...nothing! It is backed by nothing other than our 
    own belief that this system is a viable one, that it is strong enough to weather 
    the impending storms, and that it can somehow be made responsive to real human 
    needs--if only we empower and support the right political personalities and 
    forces. In the recent edition of <i>Winds of Change</i>, the newsletter of 
    the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, our friends there naively quote a 
    tribute to Granny D, by Jimmy Carter. Despite all the lofty rhetoric to the 
    contrary, individuals such as Carter are fully invested members of the capitalist 
    ruling elite and the destroying class, and if it is destroy they must to keep 
    the American ship of state afloat, destroy they will. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In a collapse neither the Federal government or the banks 
    will be able to satisfy the claims of their creditors and depositors, because 
    the money that each believes is there in the system somewhere is, in fact, 
    not really there, nor does it really exist. The Western economy has been operating 
    on such a growing counterfeit basis since the very first individual ever accepted 
    a note (or a stock, or a bond) from any mercantile or capitalist institution. 
    It has been operating on the belief (blind faith and trust, and some sense 
    that it all reflects the natural order of things on our part, and power and 
    cunning on its part), that the process is essentially (if not always) just, 
    and that international relations, upon which the flow of manufactured goods 
    and natural resources depends, can be manipulated and maintained indefinitely, 
    as if God Himself was one of them. It is on this belief that money is continually 
    created, and continually lent into existence. The age of dinosaurs was a great 
    historic metaphor, but it seems that most of us have not learned the meaning 
    of it. Nor have we understand the recent speculations around the existence 
    of a Death Star, or Companion Star, which sent giant comets in earth's direction, 
    bringing about the demise of the great serpents. Only the real star, appearing 
    now out of heaven upon the plain of human comprehension, is the totality of 
    the events of our time--the end of the age.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The first banker, and the first government to uphold and 
    protect his operation (they were probably one and the same as they are today), 
    was the first to understand and exploit the relationship between real money--the 
    things needed to sustain a civilized life, and the labor required to produce 
    them--and the things men were using in place of real money. In time, of course, 
    men were using precious metals such as gold and silver in place of real-money. 
    This came about as the evolution of world economy was accompanied by the rise 
    of the <i>strongman, </i>the<i> strong city-state</i> and eventually the <i>strong 
    nations and empires</i> of the earth. Only the strongman (and the stronger 
    than he) could command such an economy--only through the coerced and enforced 
    labors of other human beings. (For what man in his right frame of mind would 
    choose to work in a mine or quarry from sun up to sun down just to increase 
    the wealth and power of other men)? Only the strongman (in league with a priestly 
    caste) could control the means of gathering and storing these metals in a 
    central place, paying in kind for services rendered to the government...while 
    coercing others at the same time to bring their personal wealth inside the 
    gates for <i>safe keeping</i>. The government, caught in a thicket now, also 
    found it necessary to impose a tax on the people (tribute from others and 
    tolls along its roadways) to keep itself in existence. Those who did not agree 
    with such impositions, or who refused to bend themselves under the yoke of 
    Nimrod, either compromised and paid or left (if they could). They went into 
    the wilderness, and finally to America, until at last there was no place to 
    go...</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">Those charged with <i>safekeeping</i> the gold and silver 
    (the first bankers), as well as those who withdrew from their own accounts 
    from time to time, found that a note expressing the actual amount of metal 
    on hand was as expedient as withdrawing the metals themselves. The owners 
    of the gold could then write checks, or issue their own notes, to cover their 
    own transactions, which eventually found their way back to the bank for redemption. 
    Sometimes those who held the notes were not as interested in withdrawing the 
    metal themselves, they just wanted to be assured that it was still there. 
    Satisfied that it was, they had the portion owed to them transferred to another 
    account in their own name, and left with a voucher or bank draft stating that 
    they were now the owners of so much gold or silver. It did not take long before 
    those who possessed the real-money--the labor that others were employing or 
    coercing to advance their own fortunes--actually came to believe that the 
    bankers and the employers were in possession of the real-money. (After all 
    these bankers and employers not only owned the gold, but they had the power 
    to publish the notes that said that they did, indeed, own the gold). What 
    could laborers do about it, even if they understood what happened in the transformation 
    from real-wealth to contrived-wealth? Hardly anything seeing how the powers-that-were 
    (and which still are--the government, the police and the military, and the 
    bankers) were all serving the interests of one another. (Open the Book of 
    Psalms). They could stage a Spartican uprising. But we see where that led. 
    The workers could stage a Soviet-style revolution, but this was a departure 
    from the central doctrines of Christ. Or the most altruistic among them could 
    find their way up into the hierarchy of the mercantile and capitalist world--with 
    an idea of reforming it--but this too is a departure from the teachings of 
    Christ--doing evil to do good. The truly righteous in the earth could do nothing 
    but remain a remnant, devote themselves to educating others (rescuing as many 
    as they could, as they could, from both themselves and their oppressors) and 
    endure; all the while searching the times for signs of God's kingdom and practicing 
    in one's own life the spiritual, social and economic means by which we may 
    at last enter into it. (2 Kings 5:26; Matthew 6:33).</font></p>

    a certain percentage of the original metal on hand. People almost never came 
    in to remove the gold and silver owed to them, only to take stock of it. We 
    must also realize that up to this point the currency in circulation was (theoretically) 
    equal to the amount of gold and silver in stock. Anyone in possession of a 
    corresponding note could go into the bank and ask for all the gold that the 
    paper represented (minus a handling charge, of course). Even if the metals 
    physically left the bank they almost always found their way back into the 
    bank, or into some other bank--which made no great difference because in time

    if anyone with a note came into the bank, just to see if the gold was still 
    there (as long, of course, as it was not a panicked run on the bank), it would 
    be there. There was a stipulation in this scheme, however. In exchange, the 
    borrower had to agree to pay back not only the principle amount of the loan 
    but <i>interest</i> on the loan as well. The world has been at each other's 
    throats ever since. For we already understand, there was only so much gold 
    and silver (or cash) in circulation, and in order to satisfy the banks requirements, 
    individuals had to compete against each other for that limited amount in order 
    to pay back the interest on such loans. The eventual effect helped give further 
    rise to a cunning merchant and entrepreneurial class of men (unbridled growth, 
    business and commerce, eventually all the <i>great</i> banking and investment

    the words in Daniel concerning Great Babylon: <i>Thou art weighed in the balances,

  <p><font size="+1">How did these bankers create this wealth? Not with their 
    own productive labors, but with the stroke of a pen. Once they figured it 
    out they literally created <i>money</i> out of nothing as it were. They put 
    it into circulation, and then got it back at interest. They did legally what 
    others go to prison for, they produced counterfeit money. Where there was 
    previously 100% of money in circulation equal to the 100% of metals that were 
    on hand, there was soon 150% of money to metals in circulation. The added 
    percent was simply created by the bankers, and then 200% and then 500%....churning 
    into existence the ever-recurrent cycles of inflation and deflation, surplus 
    and falling inventories, that keeps everyone either employed or unemployed 
    at any given time, but always uncertain and willing to do anything it takes 
    to assure order in our own personal lives, even partake in the wholesale wickedness 
    of it all, even kill in foreign wars for the right (the <i>Freedom)</i> to 
    stay this way. It is <i>INSANE</i>. Because the wealth of this world is so 
    concentrated in the hands of the few who keep recycling it in their own private 
    interests (and sometime in our meager interests to keep us quiet and sedate), 
    it seems like there there is not enough money by trillions of dollars, to 
    meet the basic and growing needs of the world's peoples. The G-7 Industrial 
    nations see it as a cultural and population problem, but it is really a <i>Thorns 
    and Thistles</i> problem...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">When Adam (do not think <i>literally </i>here) first gave 
    in to the inclinations of Eve (not the Female gender, but <i>the church</i> 
    of their time), The Lord said to them: ...<i>Cursed be the ground for thy 
    sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns and thistles 
    shall it bring forth unto thee</i>. (Genesis 3:17,18). Later we read: <i>And 
    in the process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of 
    the ground an offering unto the Lord</i>. (Genesis 4:3). And much later we 
    read: <i>Know ye not this parable? And how will ye know all parables?</i> 
    (Mark 4:13). <i>And these are they which are sown among thorns (and thistles), 
    such as hear the word, AND THE CARES OF THE WORLD AND THE DECEITFULNESS OF 
    RICHES, and the lust of other things entering in, choke the word, and it become 
    unfruitful</i>. (Matthew 13:1-23; Mark 4:18,19; Ephesians 5:8-12). The Thorns 
    and Thistles are the cares of this world which God has burdened upon the children 
    of Cain, to prove them spiritually incapable and unequal to them, and the 
    deceitfulness of riches which they offer instead, imaging that God would, 
    for even one moment, accept such offerings. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The richer nations are even trying to convince the underdeveloped 
    nations to teach their peoples how to cut off the Creator's entryway into 
    the world, through the <i>enlightened</i> use of birth control. (But this 
    is an entirely an another issue). The Spirit is more powerful and wiser than 
    these devices. (Did someone count SIX billions of souls in the earth today). 
    In reality there are enough resources in the world, enough labor, and the 
    spiritual means, for the whole human family to meet its present needs, with 
    plenty left over to begin to enhance the quality of life of every living soul. 
    This will happen the minute we understand that LOVE is the true medium of 
    exchange. This will happen when the control of this world's economy passes 
    out of the hands of these &quot;internationalists&quot; into the hands of 
    those who are truly citizens of the world--God's world. We mean those who 
    realize that they are just passing through these dimensions, and that nothing 
    here belongs to them, and that Love is the key that opens up the world beyond.

    the very fabric of this universe and the very core of the coming world economy).

  <p><font size="+1">In exchange for a certain amount of this counterfeit money 
    the bankers required the borrower to put up a certain amount of real-property 
    as collateral. It was a clever scheme, and it worked. The people put up real-property 
    for not-real-money. When the borrower was not cunning or powerful enough to 
    come up with the principle of their loan <i>plus the interest</i>, the lender 
    foreclosed on the property, further increasing the real state of his own personal, 
    or corporate wealth. The borrower thus handed over real wealth (houses, factories, 
    land, capital investments), for created or make-believe wealth (backed by 
    nothing but the bankers connections to the power-that-be--a trust that has 
    been the ruin of thousands upon thousands, millennia after millennia after 
    millennia.<i> The wicked are like the waves of the sea. </i>They keep crashing 
    and crashing, and never learn). </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Each time the bankers sensed a crisis they called in their 
    loans, and foreclosed upon those who could not meet their demands. Then, as 
    they say in criminal circles, they hit the mattresses and waited until the 
    crisis was over. Then they came out, resold the collateral and began to loan 
    out counterfeit money again, putting themselves right back in business. All 
    the while, various historical theories began to formulate, some apologetic 
    to the emerging capitalist order and some antithetical:</font></p>

      to the degree in which he can afford the necessities, conveniences, and 
      amusements of human life...The far greater of them must derive from the 
      labours of other people...The value of any commodity, therefore, to the 
      person who possesses it...is equal to the quantity of labor which it enables 
      him to purchase or command. Labor, therefore, is the real measure of the 
      exchangeable value of all commodities...</font></p>

      But the person who either acquires, or succeeds to a great fortune, does 
      not necessarily acquire or succeed to any political power, either civil 
      or military. His fortune, may, perhaps, afford him the means of acquiring 
      both, but the mere possession of that fortune does not necessarily convey 
      to him either. The power which that possession immediately and directly 
      conveys to him, is the power of purchasing; a certain command over all the 
      labor, or over all the produce which is then in the market. His fortune 
      is greater or less, precisely in proportion to the extent of this power; 
      OR TO THE QUANTITY EITHER OF OTHER MEN'S LABORS, OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING, 
      OF THE PRODUCE OF OTHER MEN'S LABORS, WHICH IT ENABLES HIM TO PURCHASE OR 
      COMMAND. The exchangeable value of every thing must always be precisely

  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There is only one correction 
      which history has made in Marx's concept of alienation. Marx believed that 
      the working class was the most alienated class, hence that the emancipation 
      from alienation would necessarily start with the liberation of the working 
      class. Marx did not foresee the extent too which alienation was to become 
      the fate of the vast majority of people, especially of the ever-increasing 
      segment of the population which manipulate symbols and men, rather than 
      machines. If anything, the clerk, the salesman, the executive, are even 
      more alienated today than the skilled manual worker. The latter's functioning 
      still depends on the expression of certain personal qualities like skill, 
      reliability, etc., and he is not forced to sell his 'personality,' his smile, 
      his opinions in the bargain; the symbol manipulators are hired not only 
      for their skill, but for all those personality qualities which make them 
      'attractive personality packages, easy to handle and manipulate. They are 
      the true 'organization men'--more so than the skilled laborer--their idol 
      being the corporation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But as far as consumption is 
      concerned, there is no difference between manual workers and the bureaucracy. 
      They all crave for things, new things, to have and use. They are the passive 
      recipients, the consumers, chained and weakened by the very things which 
      satisfy their synthetic needs. They are not related to the world productively, 
      grasping it in its full reality and in this process becoming one with it; 
      they worship things--and in this alienated world they feel as strangers 
      and quite alone. In spite of Marx's underestimating the role of the bureaucracy, 
      his general description could nevertheless have been written today: 'Production 
      does not simply produce man as a <i>commodity</i>...it produces him in keeping 
      with this role as a <i>spiritually </i> and physically <i>dehumanized</i> 
      being...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To what extent things and circumstances 
      of our own making have become our masters, Marx could hardly have foreseen; 
      yet nothing could prove his prophecy more drastically than the fact that 
      the whole human race is today the prisoner of the nuclear weapons it has 
      created, and of the political institutions which are equally of its own 
      making. A frightened mankind waits anxiously to see whether it will be saved 
      from the power of the things it has created, from the blind action of the 
      bureaucracies it has appointed.&quot; </font>Erich Fromm, Marx's Concept 
      of Man, pp.56-58.</p>

</blockquote>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font size="+1">Marx thought that the working class itself (in league with 
    intellectuals and artists) could bring about the end of the Capitalist order, 
    but his (and Hegel's) dialectics were the dialectics of <i>materialism</i>, 
    and every order rooted in materialism must collapse. They could not see another, 
    more mystic class of workers, intellectuals and artists rising to power in 
    the earth, one being born directly out of the conflict between the two great 
    Material Orders, Capitalism and Socialism. The Gorbachevs intuitively sensed 
    that such an order could not rise out of Russia when they came to power, but 
    only out of America. They tried to catch up by releasing the energy of the 
    Russian people, by liberalizing and loosening the controls that the Russian 
    government had imposed upon the people, without sacrificing the ideals of 
    Socialism in the attempt. It was a fruitless attempt. Only in America can 
    the true spiritual revolution unfold. It is only here, and nowhere else on 
    earth (nor at any other time in history) that the people are having a full-effect 
    encounter with Darkness (the unfolding conflict between Christ and Antichrist). 
    It is only here, and nowhere else on earth, that so many people are in possession 
    of so many skills, so much talent, so much spiritual energy, such total access 
    to the means of communication, and such a (howbeit threatened) sense of their 
    own freedom. The Divine Child will be born in America. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">And while we are here, let us dispel the charges that many 
    will make us against us; we are not in league with terrorists (only God), 
    and we are not &quot;communists&quot; in the usually understood sense of the 
    term. It is an outworn accusation; and besides we admit to it--if by communism 
    we mean that form of it practiced by the early Church and by all truly faithful 
    individuals since then. (We are followers of Christ's Sermon on the Mount, 
    and the Buddha's Eightfold Path). These had <i>all things in common--</i>not 
    their wives and husbands, not their personal belongings and private thoughts 
    (they were always free to come and go as they as individuals saw fit), but 
    their social and economic world-view, their understanding of the relationship 
    between the inner spiritual world and the outer world in which the Divine 
    Spirit dwells. And so will everyone else on earth come to share the same view 
    (and enjoy the very same spiritual freedoms), as they come alive to the realization 
    that as the Creators hold all of us in common (as sons and daughters everyone) 
    we must have each other's needs in common as well. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The descent of God's kingdom, its realization in the Earth, 
    cannot be accomplished within the framework of the laws and philosophies of 
    the existing world powers. We must abandon them as we cross over to meaning 
    of the words: <i>An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter the congregation of 
    the Lord, even to their Tenth generation shall they not enter the congregation 
    of the Lord for ever. </i>(Deuteronomy 23:3). This means that no materialist, 
    Communist of Capitalist, can inherit the coming age. To understand the parable 
    we turn to the 19th chapter of Genesis, to when Lot and his family were being 
    delivered from the judgments of their age, and from the Divine Fire that was 
    falling down upon the city of Sodom. It says that Lot entered a place named 
    Zoar to escape the Fire (vs.23,24 and 30), but abandoned it and took up residence 
    in a cave with his two daughters. He abandoned Zoar (a small place, of limited 
    possibilities), for the potential of a greater future). The cave symbolizes 
    the place where hidden things were kept...just as many of those who are delivered 
    from the judgments of this age will keep in their hearts a hidden desire to 
    return to it, and to its ways. Thus the two daughters said to each other: 
    </font></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font size="+1"><i>Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth 
      to come in unto us AFTER THE MANNER OF ALL THE EARTH. </i></font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><i>Come let us make our father drink wine </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(again, 
      Proverbs 31:4,5; Jeremiah 25:15,16)</font><font size="+1"><i>, and we will 
      lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father...</i>(Genesis 19:30-38...KJV).</font></p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font size="+1">Thus were both daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
    And they bore sons whose names were Moab and Ammi, and their children, having 
    grown up <i>after all the way of men</i>, were called Moabites and Ammonites. 
    Who are they? Look into the earth. They have grown up to become the two great 
    world-systems, state-Capitalism and state-Communism. Neither of these philosophies, 
    or those who adhere to them, may enter the congregation of right-minded souls--for 
    ever. Wherever factions exist between men, there is Moab and Ammi. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Communism, however (seen from an earth-born perspective), 
    was an attempt to reverse the downward spiral of human nature, to facilitate 
    its rise from Darwin's world where the most powerful prevail, from the self-obsessions 
    and selfishness of Western Capitalism...</font></p>

    will want to have the proof that it is actually working in their pockets. 
    And this will mean &quot;pay,&quot; &quot;equal pay,&quot; and this will mean 
    currency...Not just any form of currency, but a kind that can be used by everyone, 
    everywhere, in every situation, even among those who see no need to use a 
    currency at all. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">But how can a person know if he or she is not being exploited 
    again. What do we mean by equal pay? Equal to what? Or to who? Only to those 
    who perform a similar kind of work, or who hold a similar station in life? 
    No! no! no! no! We shall not try to pull off another wicked scheme as that. 
    Why should one person's skills, their intellectual gifts (which all come from 
    God and not ourselves), entitle that person to a higher standard of living? 
    (If one comes up with a rationale for it, they have reached down into the 
    depths of their own wicked heart to get it). All of the old arguments for 
    it are shattered in the face of the realities of our own time. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Why should one person's profession (and the medical profession, 
    as well as the preaching profession, comes immediately to mind--a profession 
    that has a greater stake in our collective sickness than it does in our collective 
    health), allow its practitioners to imagine themselves more entitled, or perhaps 
    more important, than another's? Many would no doubt die if doctors suddenly 
    disappeared (hardly any if most of the preachers disappeared), but millions 
    would die if the trash was left uncollected, or if human waste was not processed, 
    or if food was not grown and carried to the market...Well let us leave off 
    with these indictments. There is hardly a soul in any profession who can escape 
    the judgment. Those who refuse to enter into the next economy with the poor 
    and the poor-in-spirit, will be an indictment against themselves. Their own 
    thoughts will either excuse or accuse them (Romans 2:15,16; 1 Cor.4:4,5). 
    Excusing themselves from their own past, they will not find the means, at 
    least not the monetary means, to set themselves up in the practices of injustice 
    again. And this, because the the value of the next currency will based upon 
    a commodity (a spiritual commodity) equally accessible to every single soul 
    in that economy: not gold, which very few can gain access to, not corn, which 
    would make bankers of farmers, and not intellectual advantage, because the 
    true intellectuals will uphold the truth...but Time. Time flows through every 
    living being, and every soul passing through these dimensions of reality possess 
    it, and has access to it, equally.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Leo Gruliow dismisses it as an outworn notion, not, I suspect, 
    because he fails to understand its implications as a world currency, but because 
    he could not see at the time how it could find its way from its confined use 
    as a local scrip--with all the forces of the present world-economy acting 
    upon it from every side--from a Soviet Collective Farm to the world at large. 
    He says:</font></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But to employ scrip today 
      is to institute a credit card of such circumscribed local use that it can 
      have only an effect of local protectionism and isolation, somewhat like 
      the effect of scrip in a company town--in a day and age when the economy 
      is a world economy. To go back to scrip, even as an expedient, is to retreat 
      into a shell and flee the real problems of a very troublesome world, in 
      my opinion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Too bad there was not time to 
      consider all the implications of the subject. And I expressed myself badly, 
      which I regret. I may even have left an apprehension when I spoke of the 
      Soviet collective farms paying their member-employees in 'hours of work'--rather 
      than in cash--a practice now being discarded for good and sufficient reason. 
      'Work-hours' and 'work-day' calculation without cash payment became just 
      that: hours worked without much resultant work-product or compensation because, 
      in the familiar Russian expression, 'They pretend to pay us, and we pretend 
      to work.'&quot;</font></p>

    world-view as we, and cannot see how a currency based upon Days, Hours, Minutes 
    and even Seconds could all at once displace the kinds of currency that presently 
    power world affairs, and thus cannot see it emerging out of the temporary 
    chaos we shall all experience as this system collapses, to a state of order 
    again as the Phoenix rises out of the flames and ashes, and the coming age 
    is born. Gruliow's concerns will alleviate when the law begins to issue forth 
    from Zion (not from Palestine, but from the Higher Jerusalem, the City descending 
    now into our awakening world-view). But this too is the subject of another

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is hardly possible to 
      talk about Marx's attitude toward religion without mentioning the connection 
      between his philosophy of history, and of socialism, with the Messianic 
      hope of the Old Testament prophets and the spiritual roots of humanism in 
      Greek and Roman thinking. The Messianic hope is, indeed a feature unique 
      in Occidental thought. The prophets of the Old Testament are not only, like 
      Lao Tzu or Buddha, <i>spiritual</i> leaders; they are also <i>political</i> 
      leaders. They show man a vision of how he ought to be, and confront him 
      with the alternatives between which he must choose. Most of the Old Testament 
      prophets share the idea that history has a meaning, that man perfects himself 
      in the process of history, and that he will eventually create a social order 
      of peace and justice. But peace and justice for the prophets do not mean 
      the absence of war and the absence of injustice. Peace and justice are concepts 
      which are rooted in the whole of the Old Testament concept of man. Man, 
      before he has consciousness of himself, that is, before he is human, lives 
      in unity with nature (Adam and Eve in Paradise). The first act of Freedom, 
      which is the capacity to say 'no,' opens his eyes, and he sees himself as 
      a stranger in the world, beset by conflicts with nature, between man and 
      man, between man and woman. The process of history is the process by which 
      man develops his specifically human qualities, his powers of love and understanding; 
      and once he has achieved full humanity he can return to the lost unity between 
      himself and the world. This new unity, however, is different from the preconscious 
      one which existed before history began. It is the at-onement of man with 
      himself, with nature, and with his fellow man, based on the fact that man 
      has given birth to himself in the historical process. In Old Testament thought, 
      God is revealed in history...and in history, not in a state <i>transcending 
      </i>history, lies the salvation of man. This means that man's spiritual 
      aims are inseparably connected with the transformation of society; politics 
      is basically not a realm that can be divorced from that of moral values 
      and of man's self-realization.&quot; </font>Erich Fromm, pp.64,65<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"> ...and the Fourth Age of men (Genesis 15:16). Think of a 
    world totally committed to the sacred, living environment <i>in which all 
    of us live, and breath, and have our being</i>, a world totally committed 
    to the production of healthy, life-sustaining, organic foods, to spiritual 
    technologies, to education, to travel, to music, to art, to the Blessed Muses. 
    We have had enough sorrow and despair to last an eternity. Let's begin to 
    assure that those in the future do not have to endure it all again. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">As we meet in the Center and lay the foundation for the new 
    spiritual order, let us become, not only lovingly committed but radically 
    accountable. (And we know the difference between 1984--or shall we say, 2004--accountability, 
    and that form that is born in an atmosphere of free-thought and willing association). 
    The Spirit of God will lead us to what is good (for God is always at the center 
    of all our thoughts), and will ever impose sanctions on those things that 
    are not good. (Airplane crashes, mental and physical disease, crumbling infrastructures, 
    <i>sanitary</i> landfills, a failing ecology, unemployment, crime, and war; 
    all of these are natural sanctions. They do not come by one man's sin alone 
    but because of our collective and corporate transgressions. Many are the victims...many 
    have born the burden of our <i>innocence</i>). </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Work will be private (a person's own labors--their own means 
    of wealth--alway belong to themselves). The individual does not <i>belong</i> 
    to the government, and personal initiative does not cease with righteousness, 
    it flourishes. Where there is real work to do people will just naturally do 
    it, just as we already do. We will work for ourselves, as we already do. And 
    we will work for others, and with others, and when we do we can be paid for 
    it, just as we are today. And where the interests are in the public domain 
    the work will be public--with every single working person sharing equally 
    in the cost of that work. This depends, of course, on whether a person actually 
    considers themselves a member of the spiritual commonwealth. Roger Williams 
    established the precept of non-association in an essential way when he said 
    that the Church had absolutely no authority over the lives of non-believers, 
    and could not impose its will in any matters whatsoever upon such individuals. 
    And likewise, that civil authorities (if there should be any, as it happened 
    in the colonies), had absolutely no jurisdiction over the spiritual lives 
    and conscious decisions of believers. Williams set the true believer free 
    from both the (colonial) church and the state. So what will be the penalty 
    for not sharing in the active work of the coming spiritual order? Well actually 
    none. If a soul wishes to remain alienated from the life of the people, from 
    the local/global economy (think of holdouts in Idaho, or fundamentalist settlers 
    on the West Bank, each imaging that they are the last outpost of Zion), and 
    if they can keep themselves together, life and limb, in the wilderness of 
    their own makings, well God bless them. They will simply be subject to the 
    wild winds that blow outside the walls of the City, or, to use another analogy, 
    to the unpredictable temperaments of The Jaguar and the Tiger--the Lords of 
    the Jungle who dwell outside of the Village compound. Disenfranchisement from 
    the community is a penalty in itself, especially when the employment office 
    is always open, and the office of public assistance is always closed (to the 
    able-bodied that is). </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">How will each person be paid? In Currency. In Hours and Minutes 
    (just like dollars and cents). What will they be paid for? For time spent 
    producing goods and rendering services. What will each goods cost? The total 
    accumulated amount of hours or minutes it took to produce it, from the cost 
    (in seconds, minutes and hours) of the basic resource to the final appearance 
    of the product in the market place. If a farmer, for instance, produced enough 
    wheat in so much time to make 1,000 loaves of bread, his price for that amount 
    of wheat would reflect the actual time it took to produce that wheat, to repair 
    the tractor etc., plus the cost in hours and minutes of the products and resources 
    he had to purchase from others to grow it. The total cost of all the products 
    he sends to market each year cannot exceed, in terms of his own personal income, 
    the amount of hours he worked that year. At, say, 40 hours a week (a generally 
    agreed upon work week for all individuals--it could be more, it could be less, 
    depending on the personal needs of the individual), at 52 weeks a year, this 
    individual farmer's income should not exceed 2,080 hours a year. It makes 
    no difference how large or how small the farm. If the farm is too big, and 
    too productive, for one person, or one family, then those who share in the 
    farmer's labors will earn the same amount (per-hour) as the farmer, and can 
    be expected to share in the same expenses. Many things will change, many things 
    will stay the same. (The farmer will not own the land, he will be the legal 
    steward of that land. If he abuses his stewardship, others will simply stop 
    working with him, or buying his products). The cost of everything will reflect 
    the total amount of time it took to produce that product).</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The transporter would then add his expenses in hours and 
    minutes--the amount of time he actually works, or the amount of time required 
    to provide his family with an equitable income--divided out over the amount 
    of wheat he transported. (Accountability, but also flexibility, trust and 
    good old common sense, must be factored into any such system so that dishonesty 
    is not built into from the very beginning). And finally the baker divides 
    his total expenses, plus the cost of his own labors in hours and minutes--the 
    time in took him to bake and sell the 1,000 loaves of bread--into the price 
    of each loaf. &quot;How much for the bread please?&quot; &quot;Three and a 
    half minutes.&quot; &quot;Thank you.&quot; No one can earn more than the actual 
    time they spent at work (unless there are extenuating circumstances, or common 
    agreements that everyone understands). It will not be very long before every 
    one knows exactly what the price of something should be, and when someone 
    along the way is gouging or being dishonest. Decisions, if not shared by everyone 
    in every single instance of the economy, will be explained to everyone, and 
    their approval sought for. Approval or disapproval will come swiftly, if the 
    price of an item goes up (without an acceptable explanation, an extra employee 
    perhaps, or a new oven) when people go elsewhere to purchase those goods or 
    services. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">But neither shall we re-abandon ourselves to the wholesale 
    possibilities of corruption in various sectors of the economy, or lapses into 
    lax principles. Our leaders, our pastors and our teachers, will sit at tables 
    as the captains of commerce and industry do today, and they will keep watch 
    over our welfare. If it is seen that a particular producer is beginning to 
    earn 10 hours in currency for what amounts to, say, only 8 hours of work, 
    little flags will go up, the people will know. The Invisible Hand of God's 
    Presence in all such matters will provide the corrective measures. Our pastors 
    and teachers will also keep us apprised of the greater needs of the world 
    at large, where resources and labor are needed, and of our collective responsibility 
    to see that they are provided. It could cost all the productive workers in 
    a given region as little as 1 minute, or 5 minutes, or even an hour a month 
    (or ten hours) apiece to restore a forest, to build a village somewhere, to 
    care for the elderly, to send teachers and healers to one place or another, 
    to afford free travel and education for students everywhere throughout the 
    earth... </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">A great clear clearing house (yes, just like the Beast...but 
    without the mind of the Beast or the Dark intentions of the Beast), will serve 
    the global interests of the new society. It will not be in charge of us, but 
    will assist both the local and central governing councils (our designated 
    agents) in collecting, regulating and disbursing public funds, keeping students 
    and others informed as to where their labors are needed, arranging transport, 
    suggesting accommodations, facilitating the great work of restoration that 
    will be underway in the world.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Can a person work more hours a day than others? Of course. 
    For less? Of course. Each person can work as many or as little hours as their 
    health and their inclinations to do so allow, as long as their overall responsibilities 
    to the community are fulfilled. If it is estimated that it require 1,000 hours 
    to repair a local bridge, say, and everyone in the region has been assessed 
    a half an hour to complete the task, a person can either pay the half-hour 
    in currency, or theoretically go down to the jobsite itself and work for a 
    half hour. The effect is the same. What if an artist or a craftsman assigns 
    a value to their work out of proportion to the time it took to produce it? 
    Don't buy it, unless, that is, you want to. No one can get overly wealthy 
    in such a society without violating the trust of the community and their own 
    integrity in the bargain. They will be soon discovered and put out of business. 
    No dishonest enterprise will ever be subsidized or supported by the people. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Suppose we go to a physician and are treated for 30 minutes, 
    but charged One and a half hours? We see, however, that there is a nurse, 
    and another assistant earning their living in this office as well. The charge 
    is an honest one. Perhaps the office has purchased a new piece of equipment, 
    the cost of the visit can reflect that purchase until the item is paid for, 
    and must return to normal again afterwards. I may even value this physician's 
    care for me more than any of the other services I receive, and the amount 
    I pay for this extra care may reflect that preference. But physicians, teachers, 
    pastors and others who attend the soul of man itself, must first of all, and 
    above others, be the servants of others, and must never, ever, be found exploiting 
    others, or living above others, even when it is within their ability to do 
    so. There should never even be a hint of it. When our natural leaders are 
    obeying their holy orders, and showing us the way, we the people will obey 
    ours, and follow them. If they should violate the trust we place in them, 
    , leave them to find other work to do. And not to worry that the world will 
    fall short of physicians and teachers. True physicians and teachers are born 
    of love. They are interested in our physical and spiritual health, not in 
    the ways they can capitalize on our affections or our sicknesses. God can 
    fill the world with such souls. In fact it is already filled with true physicians, 
    true teachers and true economists, these are just not yet at the forefront 
    of human affairs. The wicked ones have risen above us to keep us down. The 
    righteous ones have descended to us, and below us to raise us up. We will 
    know them by their fruits, and will raise them up among us.</font></p>

      held in common, wealth unapportioned, no pauper is there, no rich man, nor 
      any tyrant, no slave, nor again shall any be great or small...but all sharing 
      in common.&quot;...</font></i><font size="+1">(The Sibylline Oracle, Books
