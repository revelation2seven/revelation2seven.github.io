    failed me.' The consequence was his decision (which took traditional Indian 
    forms) to leave his home, his country, his family, and his wealth to seek 
    salvation in asceticism. He was twenty nine-years old...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instructed in the ascetic exercises 
    of Yoga, he practiced mortification of the flesh for many years in the woods. 
    'When I saw a cowherd or one who was gathering wood, I fled from forest to 
    forest, from valley to valley, from peak to peak. And why? In order that I 
    should not see them, and they should not see me.' For meditation demands solitude. 
    'Verily, this is a lovely bit of earth, a beautiful wood; clear flows the 
    river and there are delightful places in which to bathe; round about are the 
    villages. This is a good place for a noble man striving for salvation.' Here 
    sits Gautama, waiting for the moment of Enlightenment, his 'tongue cleaving 
    to his palate, clutching, squeezing, tormenting' his thoughts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But all in vain. His mortification 
    brings no awakening. He comes to understand that the truth remains veiled 
    in asceticism, that empty constraint accomplishes nothing. Then he does something 
    monstrous in the eyes of his Hindu faith; he begins to eat plentifully in 
    order to restore his strength. Regarding him as a renegade, the ascetics with 
    whom he has made friends break with him. He is alone, practicing pure meditation 
    without asceticism...</font></p>

    what suffering is, whence it is, how it can be overcome.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His insight is uttered as a doctrine: 
    neither worldly pleasure nor ascetic mortification of the flesh is the right

<p><font size="+1">If we have been following the chapters of this work to here, 
  we have seen how the entire Christ-mystery, as well as the Doorway through the 
  dimensions of this world into the World-beyond, are both situated at the same 
  place along the Central, or Middle Pillar of the World Tree at which the Buddha 
  sat. Did Gautama arrive at this Western, fully Christ-conscious state of mind? 
  Not yet; the Bodhisatvas of the world refuse entrance into heaven until the 
  Doorway to it is opened to all. Only then will they enter. He came, however, 
  to the requisite and sublime point of consciousness (the annihilation of ego) 
  that leads to it. Tradition has it that when he came to the World Tree, he sat 
  down on the North side of the trunk (the Middle Pillar) and the earth tilted 
  toward the North. He then sat down on the West side of the Tree, and the earth 
  tilted even further toward the West. Likewise on the South side. Finally he 
  stood on the East side of the Tree, and the world was in balance. He then sat 
  down with his back to the West and from a completely Eastern point of view contemplated 
  the very structure of the Universe itself:</font></p>

    stage, through the unfolding vision of the journey through life and death. 
    Our exploration necessarily begins with a direct reflection on what death 
    means and the many facets of the truth of impermanence--the kind of reflection

    to the essential 'nature of mind.' Realization of the nature of mind, which 
    you could call our innermost essence, that truth which we all search for, 
    is the key to understanding life and death. For what happens at the moment 
    of death is that the ordinary mind and its delusions die, and in that gap 
    the boundless sky-like nature of our mind is uncovered. The essential nature 
    of mind is the background to the whole of life and death, like the sky, which

  the historical process, through the work of Divine Wisdom Herself, both in the

  Divine is perfected. It is here in the West that the Christ Mystery unfolds.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The teachings make it clear 
    that if all we know of mind is the aspect of mind that dissolves when we die, 
    we will be left with no idea of what continues, no knowledge of the new dimension 
    of the deeper reality of the nature of mind. So it is vital for us all to 
    familiarize ourselves with the nature of mind while we are still alive. Only 
    then will we be prepared when it reveals itself spontaneously and powerfully 
    at the moment of death; and be able to recognize it 'as naturally,' the teachings 
    say, 'as a child running into its mother's lap'; and by remaining in that 
    state, finally be liberated...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From what source or authority, 
    then, can a book like this be written? The 'inner science' of Buddhism is 
    based, as one American scholar puts it, 'on a thorough and comprehensive knowledge 
    of reality, and on an already assessed, depth understanding of self and environment; 
    that is to say, on the complete enlightenment of the Buddha.' The source of 
    the Bardo teachings is the enlightened mind, the completely awakened Buddha 
    mind, as experienced, explained, and transmitted by a long line of masters 
    that stretches back to the Primordial Buddha...</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bardo teachings show us precisely 
    what will happen if we prepare for death and what will happen if we do not. 
    The choice could not be clearer. If we refuse to accept death now, while we 
    are still alive, we will pay dearly throughout our lives, at the moment of 
    death, and thereafter. The effects of this refusal will ravage this life and 
    all the lives to come. We will not be able to live our lives fully; we will 
    remain imprisoned in the very aspect of ourselves that has to die. This ignorance 
    will rob us of the basis of the journey to enlightenment, and trap us endlessly 
    in the realm of illusion, the uncontrolled cycle of birth and death, that 
    ocean of suffering that we Buddhists call 'samsara.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet the fundamental message of 
    the Buddhist teachings is that if we are prepared, there is tremendous hope, 
    both in life and death. The teachings reveal to us the possibility of an astounding 
    and finally boundless freedom, which is ours to work for now, in life--the 
    freedom that will also enable us to choose our death and so to choose our 
    birth. For someone who has prepared and practiced, death comes not as a defeat 
    but as a triumph, the crowning and most glorious moment in life.&quot;</font>

<p><font size="+1">It is no coincidence that the teachings of Buddhism have arrived

<p><font size="+1">After all there were lines of symmetry connecting these regions 
  of the world in the oracles. And where these lines of force--these common spiritual 
  axes--exist, one is sure to find actual historical pathways leading each in 
  the direction of the other as well. We get a hint of their common association 
  in the unmistakable Theravedic, or Buddhist (and later Franciscan) rules of 
  purpose and conduct expressed in the tenth chapter of Matthew. And then, of 
  course, we have the perspective of our own times, and access once again to the 
  oracles, to support our understanding. We can now see how Buddhism and Christianity, 
  each operating on the same sacred plain of human consciousness, are East-West 
  reflections of each other. They are joined together along the central pillar 
  of the Oracle, and between them they reflect all the subjective and objective 
  dimensions of spiritual reality. In Buddhism (in the East) the idea of God is 
  SUPREMELY present but hidden from itself, as the Spirit is from the natural 
  forces it occupies and governs. In the West, however, God is ultimately revealed; 
  or to put it another way: out of the experiences of the Lower world the mind 
  of Christ is born. In Buddhist thought the mind approaches a state of nothingness--that 
  dimensionless point that not only marks the moment of creation, or conception, 
  itself, but where one is stripped of all attachments to the external world as 
  well, as Paul himself expressed. It is where all things are neither this nor 
  that; but also where all things are not neither this nor that. The Buddha, refusing 
  to comment on anything beyond that point, teaches us to crucify our natural 
  intellects and our common assumptions about the world on the cross of Eastern 
  Consciousness. And so we must. But with a state of mind that can only come to 
  perfection in the West (which is why Buddhism has been led this way again in 
  our time), Christ illuminates that reality. The Buddha brings us to the Center, 
  and Christ teaches us where that Center is, and where it leads. One cannot pass 
  from the Seventh sefira on the Tree of Life to the Eighth without putting on 
  the sacred precepts of the Eightfold Path...</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE 
    GREATER VEHICLE OF MAHAYANA BUDDHISM</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;From about the first or second 
    century A.D. onwards. a new and very different kind of Buddhism arose in India. 
    The new school, which claimed to offer salvation for all, styled itself 'Mahayana' 
    The Greater Vehicle (to salvation), as opposed to the older Buddhism, which 
    it contemptuously referred to as 'Hinayana,' or the Lesser Vehicle. The Mahayana 
    scriptures also claimed to represent the final doctrines of the Buddha, revealed 
    only to his most spiritually advanced followers, while the earlier doctrines 
    were merely preliminary ones. Though Mahayana Buddhism, with its pantheon 
    of heavenly buddhas and bodhisatvas and its idealistic metaphysics, was strikingly 
    different in many respects from the Theraveda, it can be viewed as the development 
    into finished systems of tendencies which had existed long before--a development 
    favored and accelerated by the great historic changes taking place in northwestern 
    India at that time...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A further development which encouraged 
    the tendency to theism was the growth of interest in the 'bodhisatva.' This 
    term, literally meaning 'Being of Wisdom,' was first used in the sense of 
    previous incarnations of the Buddha. For many lives before his final birth 
    as Siddhartha Gautama the Bodhisatva did mighty deeds of compassion and self-sacrifice, 
    so he gradually perfected himself in wisdom and virtue. Stories of the Bodhisatva, 
    known as Birth Stories, and often adapted from popular legends and fables, 
    were very popular with lay Buddhists, </font>(as they are with Christians 
    still in our time)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, and numerous 
    illustrations of them still occur in early Buddhist art...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next stage in the evolution 
    of the theology of the new Buddhism was the doctrine of the 'Three Bodies'. 
    If the true ideal was that of the bodhisatva why did not Gautama remain one, 
    instead of becoming a Buddha and selfishly passing to Nirvana? This paradox 
    was answered by a theory of docetic type, which again probably had its origin 
    in popular ideas prevalent among lay Buddhists at a very early period. Gautama 
    was not in fact an ordinary man, but the manifestation of a great spritual 
    being. </font>(These, we will immediately notice, are the very same ideas 
    that Christianity wrestled with in the many years of debate leading up to 
    the Council of Nicea in the Fourth century)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The Buddha had three bodies--The Body of Essence, the Body of Bliss, and the 
    Transformation Body. It was the latter only which lived on earth as Siddhartha 
    Gautama, an emanation of the Body of Bliss, which dwelled forever in the heavens 
    as a sort of supreme god. But the Body of Bliss was in turn the emanation 
    of the Body of Essence, the ultimate Buddha, who pervaded and underlay the 
    whole universe. Subtle philosophies and metaphysical systems were developed 
    parallel with these theological ideas, and the Body of Essence was identified 
    with Nirvana. It was in fact the World Soul, the Brahmin of the Upanishads, 
    in a new form. In the fully developed Mahayanist cosmology there were many 
    Bodies of Bliss, all of them emanations of the single Body of Essence, but 
    the heavenly Buddha chiefly concerned with our world was 'Amitabha' ('Immeasurable 
    Radiance'), who dwelt in 'Sukhavati,' 'the Happy Land,' the heaven of the 
    West. With him was associated the earthly Gautama Buddha, and a very potent 
    and compassionate Bodhisatva, Avalokitshvara ('the Lord Who Looks Down').&quot;

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Two 
    parallel sets of myths and legends have developed in Tibetan culture: those 
    of the pre-Buddhist religion sometimes referred to as Bon, and those of the 
    special form of Buddhism which evolved in Tibet from the 7th century AD onwards. 
    The term Bon was originally applied to a class of priest-magicians (magi), 
    not to the religion itself, which was known as </font><i>lha-chos</i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    'sacred matters,' as distinct from </font><i>mi-chos</i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    'human matters.' From the point of view of mythology its principle features 
    appear to have been a cult of gods of the sky, the earth, and the lower regions, 
    and a cult of Mountains and divine Kings. The later Bon-po monks (followers 
    of Bon), as known through their literature and living tradition, preserved 
    very little of these earlier beliefs. In the course of their history they 
    absorbed and reproduced all kinds of beliefs with which they met, indigenous 
    and foreign, and between the 7th and 13th centuries--the period of the propagation 
    of Buddhism in Tibet--Bon evolved into a somewhat incongruous form of Tibetan 
    Buddhism...</font></p>

    immortality. In the 2nd century B.C. the Chinese emperor Wu Ti sent envoys 
    looking for the mythical palace of Hsi Wang Mu--the dwelling place of the 
    immortals, hidden in the mysterious Kunlun Mountains of Central Asia. During 
    the Middle Ages Irish monks set out on the Atlantic, seeking legendary isles

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;'There is only one Way,' 
    the 'Lotus Sutra' says again and again,'not two or three.' All human beings 
    are to achieve Buddhahood through the same Great Vehicle, Mahayana. No class 
    or group is to be disqualified; there are to be no separate catagories, such 
    as the Hinayana and pseudo-Mahayana sects distinguish, for those of different 
    social status of individual capability. No matter what means men avail themselves 
    of, all find their ultimate fulfillment in the single, universal Way of Mahayana.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was the central truth of Buddhism 
    which reigned supreme in the Heian period </font>(in Japan)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The two leading sects, Tendai and Shingon, both acknowledged such an idealistic 
    and egalitarian view of man's potential for enlightenment...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Kukai's 'Ten Stages of Religious 
    Consciousness' </font>(exemplifieded<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    </font>at the same time in the Japanese mandated tendency to place things 
    in a hierarchical framework)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...This 
    quality perhaps on Kukai's Esoteric Buddhism, as well as its emphasis on art 
    and ritual, accounts for the high favor which his new faith won in the citadels 
    of Heian culture. For the Esoteric doctrine, which entrenched itself not only 
    at the court but at Nara, the old center of Buddhism, and at Mt. Hiei, the 
    Tendai center, put far less stress in practice on the universal hope of attaining 
    Buddhahood than it did on the special means to be employed by each individual. 
    The Buddha and all creatures were made of the same stuff, the same Six elements. 
    But in the diverse manifestations of the Mandala might be seen the different 
    aspects and functions of the Three Mysteries: Body, Speech, and Mind. Through 
    their proper functioning alone could Buddhahood be attained, and the secret 
    knowledge of these functions was possessed by the Shingon priesthood alone. 
    Inasmuch as Shingon Buddhism was esoteric, it also tended to be exclusive.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the twelfth century, with the 
    sudden collapse of the Kyoto court and the onset of the feudal era, among 
    the swift and bewildering changes that ensued was a sweeping redirection of 
    religious life in Japan...In an age often seen as dominated by hardened warriors 
    and held in the tight grip of military government, it may seem paradoxical 
    that Japanese Buddhism should for the first time have become a mass movement, 
    a democracy of faith, offering to everyone tangible hope for salvation in 
    this life. Yet this is the most evident and significant feature of medieval 
    Buddhism: that it was not preserved as a mere heirloom of the 'ancien regime,' 
    but elbowed its way out among the people and made itself at home in the households 
    of humble folk.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this popularization of Buddhism 
    no doctrine or sect was more influential than that associated with the Buddha 
    Amida (Amithabha), whose Western Paradise or 'Pure Land' offered a haven to 
    weary souls in that strife-torn age...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This faith was not by any means 
    the creation of medieval Japan. It derived from the Mahayana Buddhism of Northern 
    India and Central Asia, and for centuries the worship of Amida (The Buddha 
    of Boundless Light) had been tremendously popular in China. Nevertheless the 
    spread of Pure Land doctrines in medieval times represented a striking change 
    in outlook for the Japanese, and in the process of establishing itself, the 
    doctrine too underwent profound changes. For one thing, the earlier forms 
    of Japanese Buddhism had all stressed the attainment of Buddhahood, the achieving 
    of enlightenment, whereas this faith aimed at rebirth in a land of Bliss. 
    At the same time there was a shift in emphasis away from the individual's 
    efforts to achieve enlightenment toward an exclusive reliance on the saving 
    power of the Buddha. This meant a strong monotheistic tendency--all honor 
    and devotion to Amida alone--in contrast to the strong polytheistic tendency 
    of Esoteric Buddhism, with its multitude of icons directing worship to a vast 
    pantheon of Buddhas and Bodhisatvas.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rise of Pure Land Buddhism 
    was not merely an outgrowth of the new feudal society...Already in the late 
    Heian period we find individual monks who sensed the need for bringing Buddhist 
    faith within the reach of ordinary men...Kuya (903-972), a monk on Mt. Hiei, 
    was one of these....Dancing through the streets with a tinkling bell hanging 
    from around his neck, Kuya called out the name of Amida and sang simple ditties 
    of his own composition,such as:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">He never fails to reach the Lotus Land of Bliss, Who

    that lies at the limits of scientific conceptualization, close to the Tibetan's 
    mystical view of reality. SHAMBHALA MAY BE HIDDEN IN A FOURTH DIMENSION that 
    is as concrete and real as the Three dimensions we normally see.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modern physics has revealed that 
    space contains strange curves and warps that do not fit our usual picture 
    of reality; perhaps physicists will someday discover the existence of other 
    dimensions that lay outside the range of ordinary perception. The theory of 
    Relativity already speaks of a fourth dimension of Time. Why not one of space?

    space as a tool to analyze the properties of what they investigate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fourth dimension is relatively 
    easy to conceptualize but difficult to visualize. Our usual Euclidean model 
    of space has three dimensions, each one perpendicular to the other--one going 
    east to west, another north to south, and the third up and down. If we add 
    a forth line--call it 'here to there'--that runs at right angles to all the 
    others, it will extend into the fourth dimension.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although we may not be able to 
    do this visually, we can certainly do it mathematically...These spaces would 
    be like paintings stacked against a wall; as long as we looked only at the 
    first, or top one, we would fail to see the others behind it--or even suspect 
    that they even existed. Shambhala could conceivably be hidden right here,

    meditations, and the lowest should have at least as intense appreciation for

    in thoughts, (principles, true Gnostic archai), the results are intuitive 
    formulations of dimly felt laws or principles, which at first tend to be dramatized 
    or personified. If the fantasies are expressed in drawings, symbols appear 
    which are chiefly of the so-called mandala type. Mandala means a circle, more 
    especially a magic circle, and this symbol is not only found throughout the 
    East but also among us...The early Middle Ages are especially rich in Christian 
    Mandalas, and for the most part show Christ in the Center, with the Four evangelists, 
    or their symbols, at the cardinal points. This conception must be very ancient, 
    for the Egyptians represented Horus with his Four sons in the same way. (And 
    it is known that Horus had a close connection with Christ). Later there is 
    to be found an unmistakable and very interesting mandala in Jacob Boehme's 
    book on the soul. This later mandala, it is clear, deals with the psycho-cosmic 
    system and is strongly colored by Christian ideas. He calls it the 'philosophic 
    eye.' or 'the mirror of wisdom,' which obviously means a summa of secret knowledge. 
    For the most part the mandala is that of a flower, cross, or wheel, with distinct 
    tendencies toward quadripartite structure... Mandalas of this sort are also 
    found in the sand paintings used in ceremonies of the Pueblo and Navaho Indians...I 
    have also found mandala drawings among the mentally ill, and indeed among 
    people who did not have the least idea of them...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our text promises to 'reveal the 
    secret of the Golden Flower of the Great One,' The Golden Flower is the light, 
    and the light of heaven is the Tao. The Golden Flower is a mandala symbol 
    which I have often met with in material brought to me by my patients. It is 
    drawn either seen from above as a regular geometric ornament, or as a blossom 
    growing from a plant...a drawing of this kind also expresses the origin of 
    the Golden Flower, for according to the </font><i>Hui Ming Ching</i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    the 'germinal vesicle' is nothing other than the 'Yellow </font>(Solar)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    Castle,' the 'heavenly heart,' the 'terrace of life,' the 'square inch field 
    in the square foot house,' THE DRAGON CASTLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.' IT 
    is also called 'the border region of the Snow Mountains,' the 'primal pass,' 
    the 'realm of greatest joy,' the 'land without boundaries,' and 'the altar 
    upon which consciousness and life are made.' If a dying man does not know 
    this...he will not find the unity of consciousness and life in a thousand 
    births, nor in ten thousand aeons...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For quite in accord with the Eastern 
    conception, the mandala symbol is not only a means of expression, but works 
    an effect...The image has the obvious purpose of drawing a magical circle 
    around the centre, the sacred precinct of innermost personality in order to 
    prevent flowing out...The magical practices are nothing but the projections 
    of psychic events, which are here applied to the psyche, in reverse, like 
    a kind of spell on one's own personality. That is to say...the attention, 
    or better said, the interest, is brought back to an inner, sacred domain, 
    which is the source and goal of the soul, and which contains the unity of 
    life and consciousness. The unity once possessed has been lost, and now must 
    be found again. </font>(In other words, if one can perceive the structure 
    of the mandala as encompassing all existing things, one can internalize the 
    perception and become all they perceive)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 'enclosure' </font>(which is 
    also defined by the space of one's own individual life, and one's own thoughts)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    is expressed by the idea of a 'circulation.' The 'circulation' is not merely 
    motion in a circle, but means on the one hand, the marking off of the sacred 
    precinct, and, on the other, fixation and concentration. The Sun Wheel begins 
    to run; that is to say, the Sun is animated and begins to take its course, 
    </font>(see Malachi, chapter 4)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    or in other words, the Tao begins to work and to take over leadership...They 
    cause the poles of light and darkness to rotate, that is Day and Night alternate. 
    Thus the circular movement also has a moral significance of activating all 
    the light and dark forces of human nature, and with them, all the psychological 
    opposites of whatever kind they may be...The symbol is the primitive expression 
    of the unconscious, but at the same time it is also an idea corresponding 
    to the highest intuition produced by the consciousness.&quot; The Secret of 
    the Golden Flower, pp.97-107.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When the light is made to 
    move in a circle, all the energies of heaven and earth, of the light and the 
    dark, are crystallized. This is what is termed seed-like thinking, or purification 
    of the energy, or purification of the idea...Then suddenly there develops 
    a seed pearl. (One of great value). It is if a man and woman embraced and 
    conception took place. Then one must be quite still and wait. The circulation 
    of light is the epic of Fire</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If, when there is quiet, the spirit 
    has continuously a sense of great joy as if intoxicated or freshly bathed, 
    it is a sign that the Light-principle is harmonious in the whole body; then 
    the Golden Flower begins to bud... And when one has the feeling that this 
    great Earth is a world of light and brightness, that is a sign that the body 
    of the heart opens itself to clarity. It is a sign that the Golden Flower 
    is opening...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This fine passage, from the 
    latter part of the Questions of King Menander, is probably the work of a hand 
    different from that which composed the dialogues which we have already quoted. 
    In it the Buddha almost takes on the character of a savior god, who, like 
    Amitabha in the developed Mahayana mythology, built a heaven for his followers. 
    Nirvana is not described in negative terms, but in very positive ones, and 
    the meataphor of the busy, populous, and prosperous city hardly suggests the 
    rarefied Nirvana of the previous passage, but a heaven in which personality 
    is by no means lost. It suggests in fact to the Western reader THE NEW JERUSALEM

    and perfect, he goes away to another land. And in time the city becomes rich 
    and prosperous, peaceful and happy, free from plague and calamity, and filled 
    with people of all classes and professions and of all the lands...All these

    the glorious reputation it had for holiness; yet might such a one comfort

    is inevitable, both as to living creatures and as to works and places also...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A false prophet was the occasion 
    of these people's destruction, who had made a public proclamation in the city 
    that very day, that God commanded them to get up upon the temple, and that

    was a great number of these false prophets suborned by the tyrants to impose 
    upon the people, who denounced this to them, that they should wait for deliverance 
    from God; AND THIS WAS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM FROM DESERTING, and that they 
    might be buoyed up above fear and care by such hopes. Now a man that is in

<p align="center">THE WAY TO SHAMBHALA</p>
<p align="center">A Search for the Mythical Kingdom Beyond the Himalyas</p>
<p align="center">by Edwin Bernbaum, Ph.D.</p>
<p align="left">EXCERPTED FROM CHAPTER ONE: BEHIND THE RANGES:</p>
<p align="left">Behind the ice walls of the Himalyas lie the empty deserts and 
  remote mountains of Central Asia...(There) explorers have come across the ruins 
  of great civilizations that have flickered in and out of existence like mirages 
  in time. SOME HAVE LEFT RECORDS TO IDENTIFY THEM; others have simply faded out 
  of of history...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/IuDeA.gif" width="600" height="446"></p>
<p align="left">Many have sensed the presence of some mysterious influence hidden 
  in Central Asia. Hindu mythology looks north of the Himalyas for MERU, THE MYSTICAL 
  MOUNTAIN AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD, where Indra, King of the Gods, is supposed 
  to have his jeweled palace. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Psalm 
  48:1,2)</font>. The ancient Chinese believed that their Immortals--such as Lao 
  Tzu, the founder of Taoism--had gone to live forever on a jade mountain SOMEWHERE 
  WEST OF CHINA ON THE HEIGHT OF THE KUNLUNS. An old Buddhist legend HOLDS THAT 
  THE KING OF THE WORLD WILL BE BORN CLUTCHING A CLOT OF BLOOD IN HIS HAND; Genghis 
  Khan was supposedly born in this fashion, and swept out of the heart of Central 
  Asia nearly to conquer the world, CREATING AN EMPIRE THAT REACHED FROM THE DANUBE 
  TO THE SEAS OF CHINA. The Muslims of Persia, whom he devastated, came to believe 
  he was the Scourge of God, sent out of the Gobi to punish them for their sins. 
  Modern scholars, looking for the origins of religion, have turned to the spirit 
  journeys of the Central Asian shaman, a sort of medicine man who goes in trance 
  to other worlds to rescue the kidnaped souls of the sick and dying.</p>
<p align="left">During the nineteenth the British , who had taken over India, 
  took an interest in Tibet, a mysterious country to the north that was ruled 
  by lamas, or Buddhist priests, and isolated from the world outside. The Theosophists, 
  members of an occult religious movement that became popular in England and America...spread 
  their belief that spiritual supermen with knowledge and powers far exceeding 
  those known to science lived somewhere beyond the Himalayas, where they secretly 
  guided the destiny of the world. This, and the accounts of various explorer, 
  whom the lamas tried to keep out, helped to establish Tibet's image as THE ULTIMATE 
  MYSTICAL SANCTUARY, PROTECTED BY THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS ON EARTH.</p>
<p align="left">All of this probably inspired James Hilton to write <i>Lost Horizon</i>, 
  his novel about Shangri-la, a Tibetan monastery hidden behind snow peaks in 
  an idyllic valley where people live for hundreds of years without growing old. 
  Only those who get lost can find the way to this sanctuary, concealed not in 
  the Himalayas, as might be expected, but in the <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(mystical)</font> 
  Kunluns on the northern rim of Tibet. There they lead peaceful lives devoted 
  to the study and enjoyment of art, literature, music, and science collected 
  from all over the world.</p>
<p align="left">As the High Lama explains to the hero of the novel, THE PURPOSE 
  OF SHANGRI-LA IS TO PRESERVE THE BEST OF EASTERN AND WESTERN CULTURE FOR AFTER 
  &quot;A TIME WHEN ALL MEN, EXULTANT IN THE TECHNIQUE OF HOMICIDE WILL RAGE SO 
  HOTLY OVER THE WORLD THAT EVERY PRECIOUS THING WILL BE IN DANGER, EVERY BOOK 
  AND PICTURE AND HARMONY, EVERY TREASURE GARNERED THROUGH TWO MILLENNIUMS.&quot; 
  THEN, WHEN THE WARS ARE FINALLY OVER AND &quot;THE STRONG HAVE DEVOURED EACH 
  OTHER,&quot; THE TREASURES SAVED IN THE HIDDEN SANCTUARY OF SHANGRI-LA WILL 
  ENABLE MANKIND TO EMERGE FROM THE RUINS OF THE PAST AND BUILD A NEW AND BETTER 
  WORLD.</p>
<p align="left">Something about the novel resonated so strongly in so many people's 
  minds that &quot;Shangri-La&quot; became a common word for any kind of hidden 
  sanctuary or earthly paradise. During his presidency, Franklin Roosevelt built 
  a hideaway in the hills of Maryland and named it after Hilton's idyllic monastery; 
  later on, after his death, IT WAS GIVEN ITS PRESENT NAME, CAMP DAVID...Was <i>Lost 
  Horizon </i>simply a romantic fantasy, or was it based on something deeper of 
  which Hilton may or may not have been aware?...</p>
<p align="left">While many Westerners have regarded Tibet as <i>the</i> mysterious 
  hidden sanctuary, Tibetans themselves have looked elsewhere for such a place. 
  Their sacred texts point to Shambhala, a mystical kingdom hidden behind SNOW 
  peaks somewhere north of Tibet. THERE A LINE OF ENLIGHTENED KINGS IS SUPPOSED 
  TO BE GUARDING THE MOST SECRET TEACHINGS OF BUDDHISM FOR A TIME WHEN ALL TRUTH 
  IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE IS LOST IN WAR AND THE LUST OF POWER AND WEALTH. THEN, 
  ACCORDING TO PROPHECY, A FUTURE KING OF SHAMBHALA WILL COME OUT WITH A GREAT 
  ARMY TO DESTROY THE FORCES OF EVIL AND BRING IN A GOLDEN AGE. UNDER HIS ENLIGHTENED 
  RULE, THE WORLD WILL BECOME, AT LAST, A PLACE OF PEACE AND PLENTY, FILLED WITH 
  THE RICHES OF WISDOM AND COMPASSION.</p>
<p align="left">THE TEXTS ADD THAT A LONG AND MYSTICAL JOURNEY ACROSS A WILDERNESS 
  OF DESERTS AND MOUNTAINS LEAD TO SHAMBHALA. WHOEVER MANAGES TO REACH THIS DISTANT 
  SANCTUARY, HAVING OVERCOME NUMEROUS HARDSHIPS AND OBSTACLES ALONG THE WAY, WILL 
  FIND THERE A SECRET TEACHING THAT WILL ENABLE HIM TO MASTER TIME AND LIBERATE 
  HIMSELF FROM ITS BONDAGE. The texts warn, however, that ONLY THOSE WHO ARE CALLED 
  AND HAVE THE NECESSARY SPIRITUAL PREPARATION WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO SHAMBHALA; 
  others will find only blinding storms and empty mountains--or even death.</p>
<p align="left">The earliest references to Shambhala are found in the most sacred 
  books of Tibetan Buddhism, a set of more than three hundred volumes called the 
  <i>Kangyur</i> and Tengyur<i>. </i>These works, known as the Tibetan Canon, 
  are for Tibetans what the Bible is for many Westerners; they include the sayings 
  of the Buddha and commentaries on his teachings by later saints and scholars....The 
  oldest volumes concerning Shambhala were first written down in Tibetan around 
  the eleventh century A.D. as translations from older works in Sanskrit, the 
  sacred language of India. THE CONTENTS OF THE ORIGINAL BOOKS WERE SUPPOSED TO 
  HAVE BEEN KEPT HIDDEN IN SHAMBHALA FOR OVER A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE COMING TO 
  INDIA IN THE TENTH CENTURY <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(in other 
  words, since the time of Christ)</font>. </p>
<p align="left">Since that time a number of poets, yogis, and scholars of Tibet 
  and Mongolia have composed additional works on the hidden kingdom, many of which 
  have been lost and forgotten. But the most secret aspects of Shambhala have 
  never touched paper: They have been transmitted from teacher to initiated disciple 
  by spoken word only. Lamas say that without these oral teachings many of the 
  texts, which are written in obscure symbolic language, cannot be properly understood. 
  In addition, lay people have passed on numerous folk stories about Shambhala--some 
  about the war and golden age to come, and others about the mystics who have 
  gone there and the treasures they have brought back. A few artists have also 
  painted rare paintings that show the Kings and their mystical kingdom surrounded 
  by Snow mountains. </p>
<p align="left">According to the earliest texts, Shambhala lies north of Bodhgaya, 
  a Buddhist shrine in northern India, but since the kingdom is hidden, they fail 
  to specify exactly where or how far. Guide books written later describe the 
  routs to Shambhala, but in terms so vague and archaic that their directions 
  are extremely difficult to follow. As a result, most lamas are unsure of the 
  kingdom's location and hold differing opinions as to where it might be, ranging 
  from northern Tibet to the North Pole...</p>
<p align="left">The texts are much more specific about the kingdom itself and 
  give a remarkably clear and detailed picture of it. According to their descriptions, 
  a great ring of SNOW MOUNTAINS glistening with ice completely surrounds Shambhala 
  and keeps out all those not fit to enter. Some lamas believe the peaks are perpetually 
  hidden in mist; others say that they are visible but so remote that few can 
  ever get close enough to see them. THE TEXTS IMPLY THAT ONE CAN CROSS THE SNOW 
  MOUNTAINS ONLY BY FLYING OVER THEM, BUT LAMAS POINT OUT THAT THIS MUST BE DONE 
  THROUGH SPIRITUAL POWERS--WHOEVER TRIES TO GO BY AIRPLANE OR ANY OTHER MATERIAL 
  MEANS WILL MEET DESTRUCTION ON THE OTHER SIDE...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p align="left">To emphasize that spiritual powers are needed to cross over the 
  mountains, one painting I saw shows A GROUP OF TRAVELERS WALKING OVER A RAINBOW 
  INTO SHAMBHALA...</p>
<p align="left">The jeweled palace of the King at the center of Shambhala shines 
  with a glow that lights up the Night like Day, reducing the Moon to a dim light 
  in the sky...In the center of the palace is the golden throne of the King supported 
  by eight carved lions and encrusted with the rarest gems. All around it, for 
  miles in every direction, spreads the scent of sandalwood incense. As long as 
  the King remains on this seat of Wisdom and Power, A MAGIC JEWEL GIVEN HIM BY 
  THE SERPENT DEITIES WHO GUARD HIDDEN TREASURES ENABLES HIM TO SATISFY ALL HIS 
  WISHES. MINISTERS, GENERALS, AND COUNTLESS OTHER ATTENDANTS, SURROUND HIM, READY 
  TO OBEY HIS EVERY COMMAND...In addition, the storerooms of his palace hold treasures 
  of gold and jewels beyond conception. FROM THE TIBETAN POINT OF VIEW, THE KING 
  OF SHAMBHALA POSSESSES ALL THE POWER AND WEALTH THAT BEFIT A UNIVERSAL EMPEROR...</p>
<p align="left">Tibetans have...taken the <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Indo-European)</font> 
  Sanskrit name Shambhala to mean &quot;the Source of Happiness.&quot; But this 
  does not mean that Shambhala is merely a paradise of liquid bliss...If a person 
  does good deeds and acquires enough merit, he will be reborn in the heaven of 
  the gods...But there is a catch: After hundreds of years of blissful life as 
  a god <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(think of the time between the 
  birth of Christianity and our own time)</font>, he will exhaust his store of 
  merit...Then he will know that death is near, and he will suffer all the anguish 
  he has temporarily avoided; he will die and be reborn again, BUT THIS TIME IN 
  HELL <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(In the West)</font>.</p>
<p align="left">According to Buddhism, good deeds, even those dome out of compassion, 
  are not enough; a person must also acquire the wisdom that will enable them 
  to WAKE UP TO THE TRUE NATURE OF REALITY AND KNOW THEMSELVES AS THEY REALLY 
  ARE. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Ephesians 5:14)</font>. When 
  this happens, they will transcend all suffering and attain Nirvana <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
  Changeless State)</font>, the ultimate goal beyond heaven and hell. Having, 
  thereby, achieved enlightenment (Christ Consciousness), they will become a Buddha, 
  &quot;Awakened Ones,&quot; no longer subject to the vicissitudes of life and 
  death.</p>
<p align="left">Although many lay Tibetans regard Shambhala as a heaven of the 
  gods, most lamas consider a A PURE LAND, A SPECIAL KIND OF PARADISE MEANT ONLY 
  FOR THOSE ON THEIR WAY TO NIRVANA. According to the texts, the kingdom provides 
  the conditions under which one can make the fastest possible progress toward 
  enlightenment. Whoever reaches Shambhala or is reborn there can never fall back 
  to a lower state of existence and will attain Nirvana in this lifetime or very 
  soon thereafter. Lamas add that Shambhala is the only Pure Land that exists 
  on earth. When I inadvertently suggested to the Dalai Lama that it might be 
  only an imaginary or immaterial paradise of the mind, he immediately replied, 
  &quot;NO, DEFINITELY NOT: SHAMBHALA HAS A MATERIAL EXISTENCE IN THIS WORLD.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Because of their focus on attaining enlightenment, the inhabitants 
  of Shambhala devote most of their time to study and practice of the highest 
  wisdom known to Tibetan Buddhism--THE KALACHAKRA, OR WHEEL OF TIME.&quot; This 
  is the most complex and secret of Tibetan teachings; lamas will reveal its inner 
  essence only to those initiated into it, and they add that even among initiates 
  only a very few outside Shambhala can understand the deep symbolism of its texts 
  and meditation. The Dalai Lama, who confers many of the initiations, regards 
  the Kalachakra as one of the most effective and speedy methods of attaining 
  enlightenment--provided one practices it correctly and with the proper motivation...</p>
<p align="left">More than any other form of Tibetan mysticism, the &quot;Wheel 
  of Time&quot; is concerned with finding eternity in the passing moment, the 
  indestructible in the midst of destruction. . As a consequence, those who practice 
  the Kalachakra seek the perfect state of Nirvana right here in the imperfections 
  of the world. Rather than renounce worldly activities and interests for asceticism...the 
  people of Shambhala use everything, even the distractions of luxury and family 
  life, as means of attaining enlightenment. They strive to free themselves from 
  illusion through the very things that bind other to it...</p>
<p align="left">EXCERPTED FROM CHAPTER SEVEN, THE JOURNEY:</p>
<p align="left">Tibetans believe that there are various ways of going to Shambhala. 
  Many of them think that the only way open today is DEATH AND REBIRTH...</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Blessed and holy are they who have part in the First Resurrection 
    </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(thus the First Death)</font><i><font size="+1">:

    of the oracle--the Tree of Life. Or, as the Buddha taught, the path to spiritual

</blockquote>
<p align="left"> They feel that it is no longer possible to develop the superhuman 
  powers needed to follow the guidebooks to Shambhala: All a person can do in 
  these degenerate times is pray and hope to be reborn there in some future reincarnation. 
  Despite the prevalence of this belief, a number of Tibetans still believe in 
  the possibility of reaching the kingdom in this very lifetime. In support of 
  their position, they cite stories of people who are supposed to have actually 
  taken the journey to Shambhala. Some of these stories tell of yogis or lamas 
  with exceptional powers who claim to have traveled to the kingdom in their physical 
  bodies. Others speak of spiritual or mental journeys taken without the body 
  in meditation...</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">(Whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of 
    the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth); such a one caught up to the Third Heaven...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Corinthians 12:2).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also find a number of accounts of people who are supposed to have visited 
  the kingdom in their dreams...We will examine stories of all three kinds of 
  journey to Shambhala: physical, mental or spiritual, and dream....We should 
  note, however, that Tibetans tend to regard Death and Rebirth as a fourth kind 
  of journey, which can also lead to Shambhala. According to Tibetan Buddhism, 
  when a person dies, his consciousness leaves the body and begins to wander through 
  a visionary landscape of the after death state. If he can realize the empty 
  nature of everything he meets, recognize the lights, deities, and demons he 
  sees as products of his own mind, he will attain enlightenment. If, on the other 
  hand, he takes these visions to be real and flees from them in terror, he will 
  eventually seek refuge in the safety of a comforting womb and wind up born in 
  (the same unenlightened) state of existence. Lamas read the <i>Bardo Thodol</i> 
  or <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> over a dead person's body to guide his consciousness 
  away from these pitfalls, toward enlightenment--or at least to a good rebirth 
  in a Pure Land such as Shambhala...</p>
<p>It suggests that whichever way one tries to go, one can only reach the kingdom 
  by undegoing some kind of death and rebirth. The ordinary self or ego that one 
  feels oneself to be simply does not have the power or purity needed to make 
  the journey; IT MUST DIE AND GIVE WAY TO SOMETHING DEEPER AND MORE POWERFUL. 
  Although the story speaks of a physical death, it also hints of another kind, 
  which can take place in this very life. For it to happen, one must relinquish 
  the cherished beliefs and attachments that maintain the ego and give it a sense 
  of of concrete existence--a painful experience that can feel like death itself...WHEN 
  ONE UNDERGOES THIS EXPERIENCE AND DIES TO ONE'S OLD SELF, THE DEEPER LEVELS 
  OF MIND COME TO LIFE: A NEW PERSON CAPABLE OF MAKING THE JOURNEY IS BORN.</p>
<p>EXCERPTED FROM CHAPTER NINE, THE INNER JOURNEY (The Divide Between the Mind 
  of Christ and the Mind of Antichrist).</p>
<p>If Shambhala symbolizes the end of the journey into the hidden depths of the 
  mind, India--or Tibet--represents its beginning in the familiar realm of the 
  surface consciousness. This in turn suggests that the vast expanse of intervening 
  countries described in the guidebooks to Shambhala symbolizes another part of 
  the mind which we have not yet considered. So far, in looking beneath the surface 
  consciousness, we have examined only the innermost mind and the deeper levels 
  around it. But the unconscious, as we shall call all of the mind outside of 
  the range of ordinary awareness, holds much more. IT INCLUDES A VAST AND MYSTERIOUS 
  REGION SIMILAR TO THE LITTLE-KNOWN LANDS BETWEEN INDIA AND SHAMBHALA WITH ALL 
  THEIR DEMONS AND DEITIES--A REGION FILLED WITH DELUDED PASIONS AND SUBLIME INSIGHTS, 
  REPRESSED DESIRES AND ALTRUISTIC IMPULSES, A CONFUSING BLEND OF THE DEMONIC 
  AND THE DIVINE.</p>
<p>The unconscious consists, in fact, of two major parts, which we shall call 
  the superconscious and the subconscious. The superconscious is the pure region 
  symbolized by Shambhala--the realm of the innermost mind together with the deeper 
  levels that surround it. We use this term because it contains a clear and purified 
  awareness that can penetrate to the true nature of things as they are. THE GREAT 
  DISTANCE SEPARATING SHAMBHALA FROM INDIA AND TIBET INDICATES THAT THE SUPERCONSCIOUS 
  IS HIDDEN DEEP IN THE MIND, FAR FROM THE ILLUSIONS OF THE SURFACE CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>
<p>The subconscious, as its name suggests, lies just beneath the surface consciousness 
  in the gap between it and the superconscious. WE FIND THE SUBCONSCIOUS SYMBOLIZED 
  BY THE VAST EXPANSE OF LANDS THAT LIE BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE 
  JOURNEY TO SHAMBHALA. As we shall see in our interpretation of the guidebooks, 
  the subconscious contains a mixture of different elements, some of which come 
  from the superconscious and some of which come from the surfce consciousness. 
  The former provide bright rays of illuminating awareness, while the latter generate 
  dark clouds of delusion. The surface consciousness unwittingly contributes its 
  share to the subconscious by repressing those parts of itself--passions, fears, 
  and so forth--that do not fit the ego, its symbol of itself. As a result they 
  become unconscious and mix with elements from the deeper levels of the mind 
  that are rising toward consciousness, trying to awakenn. Because of this, when 
  we dip beneath the surface consciousness, we find ourselves in a fluid region 
  of shifting states of mind where things have a double-edged nature that can 
  both help and hinder us in our quest for liberation.</p>
<p>Although repressed and out of sight, the alienated parts of the surface consciousness 
  continue to function, often in warped and chaotic ways. Without control or direction, 
  they can spread ;ike cancerous growths through the subconscious, appropriating 
  the energy of various elements of the deeper levels of the mind that are there. 
  In the process, they gain power over the rest of the surface consciousness, 
  producing inexplicable quirks of thought and emotion. Unseen conflicts between 
  repressed impulses struggling blindly gainst each other can break out in the 
  form of...contradictory behavior, ranging from the symptoms of mild neurosis 
  to those of severe <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(spiritual)</font> 
  psychoses <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(as is being demonstarted 
  by the spirit of Antichrist in these last times)</font>...</p>
<p>EXCERPTED FROM CHAPTER TEN, THE INNER PROPHECY:</p>
<p>Having looked into the inner meaning of Shambhala and of the journey to it, 
  we can now turn to the last major theme of the myth: the prophecy of the final 
  battle and the golden age to come. Like the preceding...themes, it speaks of 
  a liberation that occurs within as well as without. According to the prophecy, 
  the future King of Shambhala will come not only to deliver the world from the 
  external tyranny of the barbarians (Daniel 2:3,4; 7:9,10; 2 Thessalonians 1:3-10), 
  but also to liberate its inhabitants from the internal bondage of their own 
  delusions. The main purpose of the final battle and the golden age is to bring 
  about the conditions and teachings needed to attain enlightenment--to help people 
  awaken the innermost mind and know the true nature of Reality. Since the events 
  of the prophecy lead up to this end, it makes sense to examine them in some 
  detail to see what their symbolism can reveal about the path to liberation...</p>
