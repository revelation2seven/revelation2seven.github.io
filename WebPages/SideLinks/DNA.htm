  <p><b>Code breaking has recently become the most important human scientific 
    endeavor since landing on the moon.</b></p>
  <p><b>Each of us carries a marvelous coded message in our cells: in sugar-phosphate 
    molecules called DNA, we carry the equivalent of 220 Richmond telephone books 
    of information. Every cell in our body carries a copy.</b></p>
  <p><b>A wide array of laboratories and researchers are working on breaking the 
    code. This effort is the Human Genome Project, a 15-year international effort...</b></p>
  <p><b>It was not until 1953 that Francis Crick and James Watson...demonstrated 
    that DNA was a molecule that looked like a spiral staircase--the famous double 
    helix.</b></p>
  <p><b>The genetic code for humans has three billion steps, or base pairs. Long 
    strings of these base pairs form genes--the individual messages about how 
    to build and operate a human organism in all its complexity...</b></p>
  <p><b>Of course, locating and identifying the 3 billion base pairs and the 60,000 
    genes they spell out is just the first step. Well into the next century researchers 
    will be trying to decode the (entire genetic message). </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Richmond

  a fact reflected in the words: <i>Become passers by.</i> (Gospel of Thomas 42). 
  The general law of Thermodynamics, by revealing what energy is doing, reveals 
  what God is doing: <i>Entering Their rest.</i> In the process God (Nature) is 
  transforming the entire Life-force of this universe into pure spiritual energy--pure 
  Thought--and will at last draw the whole of it through the vortex of this world 
  into the eternal world that lies beyond. The material world is the field (the 
  illusion if you will) into which Life has descended, and through which Life 
  is passing. We can see it more fully when we compare the almost purely spiritual 
  dimensions of the Oracle (the Universal Tree of Life) with the Watson-Crick 
  model of the DNA molecule, out of whose very interior the Code of Life has been 
  passed from the beginning, from life-form to life-form, across the entire creation 
  process, to this present day. It began with the words: <i>Let there be Light

  arguments don't hold up.&quot; &quot;This argument from <i>design</i>,&quot; 
  he says disparagingly. And then: &quot;...Science welcomes the possibility of 
  evolution resulting from forces beyond natural selection. Yet these forces <i>must</i> 
  be natural; they cannot be attributed to actions of mysterious creative intelligences 
  whose existence, in scientific terms, is unproved.&quot; (p.82). (We can see 
  Rennie looking at those around him, arms folded, shaking his head in self assuredness 
  as if he had just solved by <i>fiat</i> the mystery of existence) &quot;They 
  lobby for creationist ideas such as <i>Intelligent Design,&quot; </i>he says 
  haughtily . (p.83). &quot;<i>Intelligent Design</i> offers few answers,&quot; 
  he continues. &quot;For instance, when and how did a Designing Intelligence 
  intervene in life's history?...By creating the first D.N.A.? the first cell? 
  the first human?&quot; (P.85). &quot;In short, creationists are not giving the 
  scientific world good reason to take them seriously.&quot; </font></p>

  The World has seen with its own eyes, and experienced with its own senses, the 
  things that have transpired in history, and what things have emerged from the 
  Mind of Nature over the last six-thousand years (and more particularly over 
  the last one hundred years), as a result of that single archetypal &quot;transgression,&quot; 
  when it is said that Adam and Eve took from the dark, or the forbidden side 
  of the Tree of Life. (Please see chapter 3 of this work). By showing us the 
  past (and we can plainly see the present), God has shown us the (possible) future. 
  Our minds are now capable of not only imagining it, but of creating and expressing 
  in every artistic and graphic way, what it could be like if we continue in the 
  path of these present transgressions. What transgressions? Those coming to spiritual 
  maturity know exactly what we mean. In fact almost everyone should be able to 
  tell the difference now between &quot;good&quot; (or that which is in harmony 
  with Life as God created it...and as God is creating it), and &quot;evil&quot; 
  (which is not). In fact the soul that cannot see or comprehend the difference 
  cannot proceed. (They shall be selected <i>out, </i>just as the dinosaurs were 
  selected out, and as the ancient Atlanteans and all the other preceding empires 
  of Western man were selected out). For we have not only returned to the Garden, 
  to the place of the original transgression, where both disbelief and disobedience 
  first found a place in the human heart, but we have returned once again to the 
  words:</font></p>

  <p><b>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - South Korean and U.S. researchers said on Wednesday 
    they had cloned a human embryo and extracted from it sought-after cells called 
    embryonic stem cells. The experiment, the first published report of cloned 
    human stem cells, means so-called therapeutic cloning is no longer a theory 
    but a reality. </b><b>Supporters of medical cloning say it can transform medicine,

  <p><b>But critics say it involves destroying a human embryo, however tiny, and

    created the clone using eggs and cumulus cells donated by Korean women. </b><b>Cumulus

  </blockquote>
  <p><b>In the space of three short decades the computer chip industry has come 
    to resemble the Sorcerer's Apprentice.</b></p>
  <p><b>The exponential growth in computing power has produced stunning advances 
    in a range of sciences and engineering fields ranging from decoding the human 
    genome to the design of machines that can outplay the best human chess player.</b></p>
  <p><b>And that in turn has led to exuberant predictions of a dawning of vast 
    new information age utopias. Sentient intelligent machines are as close as 
    three decades away, many industry leaders believe; smart materials that can 
    repair themselves and genetically coded immortality may also be just around 
    the corner.</b></p>
  <p><b>Given the hype and relentless optimism, perhaps it is not surprising that 
    serious scientists and researchers have begun to explore darker, less inviting 
    visions of the future. (As in the movie Jurassic Park). This month an unlikely 
    new doomsday prophet has emerged. In an essay in <i>Wired</i> magazine, a 
    popular forum for high-technology boosterism, Bill Joy, the chief scientist 
    at Sun-Microsystems, warns that the human species may be on the verge of collective 
    suicide. &quot;The 21st-century technologies--genetics, nanotechnology and 
    robotics--are so powerful that they can spawn whole new classes of accidents 
    and abuses,&quot; he writes.</b></p>
  <p><b>Mr. Joy is hardly a Luddite, but his gloomy pronouncements fit squarely 
    into a long tradition of apocalyptic warnings about technology run amok, dating 
    back to ancient Greeks, and voiced more recently in a millennial laundry list 
    of threats, including nuclear winters, global warming, and ozone depletion...</b></p>
  <p><b>As harrowing as those threats may have appeared, for Mr. Joy and others 
    the worst is yet to come. The new danger, they argue, is self-replication, 
    the technique at the heart of both modern biotechnology and the relatively 
    new field of &quot;material sciences&quot; (the creation of advanced materials 
    such as new ceramics or liquid crystal displays), which has the capacity for 
    tremendous good as well as destruction. The fears fall in three broad areas.</b></p>
  <p><b>ROBOTICS</b></p>
  <p><b>Consider a future world in which robots operate with microprocessors a 
    million times more powerful than today's. Hans Moravec, a robotics scientist 
    at Carnegie Mellon University, conjures images in his writings of totally 
    automated factories and networks that will emerge as soon as 2020. These robotic 
    systems will be able to program themselves and compete vigorously with humans 
    for resources, perhaps creating self-sufficient artificially intelligent economies 
    that could squeeze humans out of existence. (Think about a factory that decides 
    to create an army of Robocops).</b></p>
  <p><b>Another computer scientist, Vernor Vinge, SAYS MACHINE INTELLIGENCE WILL 
    AWAKEN SOMETIME BETWEEN 2005 AND 2030, a date he calls &quot;THE SINGULARITY.&quot; 
    Dr. Vinge argues that this evolutionary watershed might accelerate progress 
    beyond human control.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>The Internet</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Others suggest that the Internet may someday reach a critical mass of 
    interconnections that at the least might exhibit some kind of chaotic behavior, 
    perhaps even some kind of sentience. The problem, of course, is that such 
    a system might be intelligent but not rational, thrashing around like a newborn 
    baby--turning off power systems or launching missiles at random.</b></p>
  <p><b>NANOTECHNOLOGY</b></p>
  <p><b>Nanotechnology refers to mechanical engineering on a molecular scale. 
    The holy grail for nanotechnologists are sub-microscopic chemical or mechanical 
    machines called assemblers that can reproduce and repair themselves...</b></p>
  <p><b>Mr. Joy believes that within several decades similar advances will lead 
    to incredibly low-cost solar power, vastly more powerful computers and cures 
    for everything from the common cold to cancer.</b></p>
  <p><b>But here's the catch: in the wrong hands, or perhaps accidentally, nanotechnology 
    could open up a Pandora's Box. This nightmare has long been the stuff of science 
    fiction...</b></p>
  <p><b>In real life it might be possible to create tough omnivorous bacteria 
    that could out-compete real bacteria. Spread by the wind, like blowing pollen, 
    they could be designed to replicate swiftly and reduce life on earth to dust 
    in a matter of days...</b></p>
  <p><b>GENETIC ENGINEERING</b></p>
  <p><b>While both robots and nanotechnological weapons are at least a generation 
    away, genetic weapons are not...</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Much </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(notice the Freudian 
    slip here)</font><b> of the talk about information-based weapons is baloney,&quot; 
    said Edward Feigenbaum, the former chief scientist of the United States Air 
    Force. &quot;But biological terrorism is real and the government is beginning 
    to take steps to defend against it.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The 
    government is mostly the cause of it. All judgments proceed from God)</font><b>.</b></p>
  <p><b>Some scientists are worried both about the specter of genetic experiments 
    accidentally escaping into the population </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(as 
    the AIDS virus did)</font><b> and also what Mr. Joy calls a &quot;white plague&quot; 
    (a reference to another science fiction novel, by Frank Herbert)--genetically 
    engineered bioweapons that could be targeted on a specific region of race.</b></p>
  <p><b>It doesn't end there--there are even more exotic technological threats. 
    Last year a brief media frenzy broke out over the speculation that the Brookhaven 
    National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider could create an artificial 
    black hole that would devour the earth in a matter of minutes. Scientists 
    insisted that such fears were unfounded, yet as Armageddon scenarios go, it 
    was a doozy. Earlier this month several physicists filed suit in federal court 
    to stop the experiment. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

  <p><b>Take a stroll down one of your own DNA molecules away from this unbelievably 
    ancient message, and you will come to a spot bearing actual scars of a war 
    that took place almost yesterday between your mother's genes and your father's 
    genes. A truce was called, and you were born. But different battle scars on 
    your maternal and paternal DNA are still there for you to see...</b></p>
  <p><b>The hereditary information in each gene--the genome--can be views as a 
    &quot;Book&quot; containing about three billion characters of text written 
    into molecules of DNA. This is no metaphor. The text of my genome is as real 
    and discrete as the text of this review (which as I write, exists only as 
    a string of bits on a computer disk). Over the last two decades scientists 
    have created machines that automatically &quot;read&quot; text from DNA and 
    &quot;write&quot; it into computer memory. The Human Genome Project is a scientific 
    effort to read the whole book of three billion characters and place them all 
    in their right order. It will soon be completed...</b></p>
  <p><b>In addition to genetic messages (in our own gene sequences) that once 
    helped an ancestor but typically serve no purpose today, there are huge tracts 
    of the human genome that never helped anyone. These regions teem with genetic 
    parasites that hitchhike onto your chromosomes and pass themselves into your 
    children. At least 95 percent of your genome is occupied &quot;BY THIS USELESS 
    BAGGAGE.&quot; Just as amazing, the 5 percent actually required to bring you 
    into existence is itself a battlefield of conflicts &quot;between parental 
    genes and childhood genes, or between male genes and female genes.&quot; As 
    Ridley says, these ideas have shaken the philosophical foundations of biology, 
    but they are little known outside of a small group of evolutionary biologists...</b></p>
  <p><b>Ridley also explores the most contentious area of genetics--human behavior. 
    He has nothing but contempt for those who deny the role played by genes in 
    personality, sex and intellectual differences...Behavioral genetics is so 
    contentious because, more than any other area of science, it has direct impact 
    on political theory and practice. If we accept a significant influence of 
    genes on behavior and ability, we are forced to concede that genes would be 
    of the utmost importance in determining who wins or loses in an idealized 
    meritocracy where environments and opportunities are all equalized. And in 
    a court a defendant's genes would have to be considered the same way that 
    &quot;mental status&quot; is today in determining whether someone is fully 
    responsible for their actions...Ridley believes that a quest for social justice

    <p align="center"><b>By Seth Borenstein</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>WASHINGTON__The human genome, the 3.15 billion-letter instruction book 
    for our cells, seems pretty elegent. But it turns out to be chock-full of 
    typos, gibberish, repetitions and redundancies, and scientists don't know 
    why.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Junk DNA,&quot; some call the residue, and it takes up an amazing 
    97 percent of our genome. So last week's announcement that the human genome 
    was fully mapped is tempered by a monumental mystery: What is this junk doing 
    in our DNA?</b></p>
  <p><b>It's suddenly a hot topic in genomics, splitting the field into scientists 
    who think the mystery material is useless and those who say it has some not-understood-but-vital-purpose. 
    <font size="2">(Let's see now. What side of this controversy do we fall down 
    on)?</font></b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;This is something we tend to think a lot about after we've had a 
    lot of beers,&quot; said Rick Wilson, professor of genetics and co-director 
    of the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University in St. Louis. &quot;You 
    want to believe that the system is designed to be as efficient as possible. 
    So way does it have all this other stuff?&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>The DNA needed to produce the proteins that do all the cell's work amounts 
    to only 3 to 5 percent of the human genome, biologists say.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;There's a lot more going on than that,&quot; concludes Ken Dewar, 
    a research scientist at the Massachusettes Institute of Technology...The rest 
    of the genome is technically called noncoding, or, because it gets in the 
    way of decoding, &quot;nonsense.&quot; Cells themselves delete it when they 
    reproduce DNA. </b></p>
  <p><b>Scientists say there are two major types of junk DNA. One is expressed 
    as a repetitive sequence that keeps popping up in the DNA strand. </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;For the life of me, I can't figure out why it's anything like a 
    benefit&quot; to have all these repetitions, said Steven Scherer, director 
    of mapping at Baylor College...</b></p>
  <p><b>The other type of junk is introns, seemingly random repetitions in the 
    middle of real protein instructions. It's as if in this sentacgtcaaagtcaaaence, 
    the letters &quot;acgtcaaagtcaaa&quot; were stuck in the middle of the word 
    &quot;sentence.&quot; When the DNA replicates, the cell edits out the &quot;acgtcaaagtcaaa&quot; 
    and just copies the word &quot;sentence.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The cell has to go to a lot of trouble because the introns are there,&quot; 
    said Rex Chisholm, professor at Northwestern University in Chicago. Introns 
    seem tied to evolution, he said. The more highly evolved species, such as 
    humans, tend to have more and longer introns than less-evolved life-forms, 
    such as yeast...</b></p>
  <p><b>Scientists who think of noncoding DNA as garbage simply say that cells 
    are inefficient. Junk DNA, especially introns, may have been relevant in earlier 
    evolutionary stages or it could have been a harmless mistake. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Say! 
    Well maybe they're waiting there for future use. Or perhaps that &quot;which 
    is not&quot; is needed to define &quot;that which is.&quot; If they are not 
    carried over from the parent cell to the new cell, how do they get there?)</font><b><font size="2">...</font></b></p>
  <p><b>Rudolph Raff of the Indiana Molecular Biology Institute compares the junk 
    DNA to someone adding empty file folders with blank paper to a filing cabinet. 
    &quot;It doesn't matter, and that's the way I think our human genome is to 
    a large part,&quot; he said. Others think it has a purpos that hasn't been 
    discovered.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;I don't think there's anything that is junk DNA,&quot; said top 
    government genomics researcher Ari Patrinos...&quot;We just don't know (the 
    use for it). For us to be arrogant about making presumptions about what is 
    and what isn't necessary is pretty human.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Early research is finding that when the seemingly nonsense parts of DNA 
    are removed, cells multiply a bit, but don't function as well as they do with 
    full-length genomes.</b></p>
  <p><b>This is why biologists who've mapped the genome are only on &quot;the 
    beginning of a wonderful voyage,&quot; Patrinos said. &quot;The clicks and

<p align="center"><b>Milk - Something Very Bad Has Happened<br>
  And We May Never Learn The Truth From The FDA<br>
  By Robert Cohen <br>
  notmilk@earthlink.net<br>
  1-23-04</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Something Very Bad Has Happened and we may never learn the truth from 
    FDA. I often see the clues, hear the rumors, and examine the facts long before 
    newspapers get the first inkling of a story. My advice for you today is sell 
    Monsanto stock short. Good news for consumers is bad news for Monsanto. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Very shortly, perhaps in just a few weeks, cows sent to slaughter will 
    have to be separated into two lines--those treated with the genetically engineered 
    bovine growth hormone and those not receiving injections of Posilac. USDA 
    will mandate this because of some very serious news. The first rumors came 
    out of the state of Kentucky on Monday. Representatives of dairy co-ops have 
    been telling dairy farmers that cows treated with Posilac have been developing 
    bone cancers. I have received this news from a very good authority, although 
    I am not at liberty to reveal my source. Let's call him Mr. W.M. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>What could be worse? I have a copy of a letter that Monsanto mailed to 
    its dairy farmer customers on December 19, 2003. On that date, Monsanto shocked 
    farmers by alerting them to the fact that Posilac would be in limited supply 
    until: &quot;Conditions and improvements in manufacturing are made...&quot; 
    Monsanto is accepting no new customers, and anticipated their &quot;shortfall&quot; 
    to last for &quot;several months.&quot; <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>I have just learned (another rumor) that Florida farmers are being warned 
    that Monsanto will cut back Posilac distribution to 50% or less on or about 
    March 1, 2004. All of genetic engineering and biotechnology was based upon 
    the safety of Posilac. We naive Americans have been part of an experiment, 
    and are learning that Posilac may have compromised the safety of rbST-treated 
    cows and humans who consume hormone-rich body fluids from these cows. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Ex-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was hired by Monsanto to tell Americans 
    on February 6, 1994: &quot;Milk from cows given supplemental bovine somatotropin 
    is the same as any other milk...Unfortunately, a few fringe groups are using 
    misleading statements and blatant falsehoods as part of a long-running campaign 
    to scare consumers about a perfectly safe food.&quot; The following day, Monsanto 
    scientist Bernard Violand submitted a paper to the Journal of Protein Science 
    admitting that Posilac contained many different &quot;freak amino acids.&quot; 
    That paper was stamped &quot;received&quot; by the journal on Thursday, February 
    10, 1994, and published on July 6, 1994. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Monsanto fixed the errors. FDA now knows of those mistakes because my 
    whistle broke windows. During the process of developing a new technology to 
    filter out those freak amino acids, Monsanto never alerted FDA as to the nature 
    of their error. Had they done so, such honesty would have cost Monsanto over 
    $500 million. Monsanto should have repeated the research because every scientific 
    paper submitted to FDA was performed on animals with a different formula than 
    the one currently on the market. Monsanto's actions are criminal. So are FDA's. 
    We know the perps. Look at your kids. Look at your friends and relatives. 
    They are the victims. <br>
