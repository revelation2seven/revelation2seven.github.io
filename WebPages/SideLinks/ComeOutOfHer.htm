      <p align="left"><b>The wind began to blow at exactly 8:46 a.m., when the 
        city was hushed for a frozen minute of silence. The wind was fierce and 
        sudden, driving from the west across harbor and river, pushing violently 
        through the spaces between buildings...</b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>Down in the foundation of the destroyed World Trade Center, 
        relatives of those who died a year ago were coming forward to drop roses

        in the earth beneath their feet...</b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>And then the wind seemed to become an essential part 
        of this day of remembrance. It was as if it were lifting all the anguish 
        out of the pit, out of the earth, out of the hearts of all mourners and 
        dispersing it into the sparkling air.</b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>A cleansing wind. A liberating wind. Once more at this

        friend Henry Meir about the components of the great Jewish traditions 
        of mourning: sitting <i>shivah</i>, WHERE YOU SURRENDER TO THE INVINCIBILITY 
        OF DEATH FOR SEVEN DAYS; <i>sheloshim</i>, for another 30 days, remembering 
        the dead as they were in life, and then a mourning period of 11 months 
        until the one-year anniversary called <i>Yahrzeit</i>. The prayer of mourning 
        is called <i>Kaddish</i>.</b></p>
      <p><b>Meir was saying that the understanding of <i>Yahrzeit</i> is that 
        &quot;now we must get on with our lives.&quot; And still we must pray...The 
        words of the old Jewish poet were apt for a New York that has reached 
        <i>Yahrzeit </i>and is getting on with life. The words, of course, acknowledge 
        the mercies of the Lord:</b></p>

    come, and now passed. We have been inundated with the images, and the sounds 
    of America mourning, they are fresh in our minds. And though a billion tears 
    have been shed, and a billion words have been written since the fiery, and 
    totally surreal collapse of those towers a year ago, America has not come 
    one step closer to comprehending the meaning of it all. In fact, as America 
    moves closer to the next stage of its war of retribution (its<i> insistance 
    on justice) </i>it is moving further and further away from understanding the 
    meaning of it all, and closer and closer to the judgment (the <i>justice) 
    </i>that God has prepared and layed out for it. <i>Thou shalt kindle no Fire 
    throughout your habitations on the sabbath day</i>. (Exodus 35:3). America 
    is intent now (<i>hell-bent</i> is the word) on kindling the further flames 
    of God's Divine Wrath, flames that will eventually descend upon America again 
    in the most horrendous way, as it is also written: <i>For our God is a consuming 
    Fire</i>. (Deuteronomy 4:24; 32; 22-25; Hebrews 12:29). This will come as 
    the American people place further reliance and faith in the American political 
    process and in those evil ones who have risen to the pinnacle of power as 
    a result...</font></p>

    facts: (1), There are, indeed, no powers on earth but those that are ordained 
    of God (Romans 13:1-8, KJV). (Please consider the spiritual implications of 
    those words, and ask: why do George Bush and the other political and religious 
    leaders of the American order--those who call themselves Christians--not believe 
    that they are subject to them? As &quot;christians&quot; the word is explicitly 
    enjoined upon them; they too must fear the Power, but they don't); and (2), 
    that while the United States of America is the only place on earth, and the 
    American experience the only conditions out of which the Child of Revelation 
    can be born, the paradox is that the American nation itself was founded in 
    the clear violation of the precepts of Christ's teachings to begin with. It

    wealth. It was founded in oppression, in continual disservice to indigenous 
    peoples and minorities, children, the poor, and literally on the backs of 
    its own working people. (Any changes in the American regime, any reforms to 
    the system on behalf of the oppressed, had always to be forced upon it. Such 
    changes never sprang, as it were, from the wellsprings of the mercantile and 
    capitalist heart). America is founded in the crafty misuse and distortion

    no law is, there is no transgression </i> (Romans 4:15). Until God's revelation 
    to Adam Six thousand, or 120 Jubilees of years ago (120 X 49 = 5,880 years), 
    humankind could not conjure up the winds of war, or incur God's creative wrath 
    as it has been since that time, and particularly since the beginning of the 
    20th century, because there was no commandment in the earth against participating 
    in the act of war. Until the time of Adam humankind was following its own 
    natural, <i>primal-angelic </i>instincts. It had no fully-conscious idea of 
    the God of the Universe--of the Single Force that governed heaven and earth. 
    Its sense of good from evil was limited to those aspects of reality that enhanced 
    individual and tribal well-being from those that did not. Everything that 
    enhanced and preserved the life of the individual, the family, the clan and 
    the tribe was good. Everything that threatened life was evil. The world was 
    filled with good forces and good spirits, but it was also filled with malevolent 
    forces and evil spirits. Humans invoked and propitiated the good and protected 
    themselves as best as they could, and by what ever means they could, from 
    the evil. It is the <i>natural</i> state of mind.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="+1">And then something happened in the earth that 
    altered the course of human history, an event that set the world on its course 
    to the 20th century of this common era and toward all the events that are 
    unfolding in the earth at this present time. God began a process that is only 
    now coming to its conclusions. They began to create a new order of humankind, 
    the order of <i>Man</i>, an order created in <i>Their</i> own image. (Genesis 
    1:26). <i>They </i>are <i>ONE</i>: </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">God (the Heavenly Father and the Divine Mother, 
    Heaven and Earth, Above and Below, and All that Exists, both visible and invisible) 
    revealed Themselves to one single, archetypal couple, a male and a female 
    whom the sacred writings call <i>Adam. </i>(Genesis 5:1,2). Adam is not the 
    first human beings, but rather the first of the human order to perceive in 
    their own relationship to each other, and in their mutual relationship to 
    the world around them, the Singular Nature of God's Presence in all things, 
    not only in the universe above but in the earth below, and in every living 
    creature that dwells on the earth. <i>God is Light (LIFE), </i>they realized,<i> 
    and in Him there is no Darkness (DEATH) at all. </i>They (Adam) were the world's 
    first monotheists, their children were the first cosmologists. They were the 
    first to realize that everything flows from the same source--day and night, 
    light and darkness, good and evil, the appearance of life and the appearance 
    of death. They were the first to perceive Reality in higher, theological (and 
    <i>quantum</i>) terms, the first to ask pertinent questions of the Universe 
    and, in turn, to receive the pertinent answers. They were the first to perceive 
    the order (the Beauty) in what seemed to everyone else to be natural chaos. 
    They were the first to conceptualize the idea of symmetry, the first to speak 
    in terms of the hidden principles that permeated creation, holding it together, 
    giving it form. It was a startling revelation, for it implied that if there 
    is, indeed, only one Primary Force in the universe, and that if that Force 
    is both Intelligent and Benevolent (as well as fierce), and that if there 
    is a pattern and a meaning to it all, and another dimension to reality that 
    is not revealed to the natural eye, then there was nothing to fear from the 
    Universe at all, as long as one brought themselves into harmony with its higher 
    precepts. All things must, despite every appearance to the contrary, be working 
    out to the good. &quot;For, after all,&quot; Adam deduced, &quot;why would 
    God reveal these things to us if it was not so? We who only seek the good 
    in life, and those things that are good for all others?&quot; Adam--a male 
    and female in love and in harmony with each other, and with Creation itself--were 
    the first Christs in the earth. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">We do not know what race these first seers belonged 
    to, other than the <i>human race</i>. Anyone who cares to make the claim to 
    them may do so. It makes no matter, for they are archetypal, and their spiritual 
    seed in the earth were born, <i>not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, 
    nor of the will of man, but of God</i>, (John 1:13), and these are known by 
    their fruits. What we do know, however, is that the biblical story of Eden, 
    and the precepts and laws that attended this evolution in human consciousness, 
    were carried across the Atlantic, out of an Atlantean civilization that was 
    being inundated and destroyed by the judgment wars that God was igniting in 
    the earth in those ancient times....</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="+1"> These recollections, transmitted orally at 
    first, were carried Eastward by those adepts in the newly emerging spiritual 
    sciences. They came out of those terrible events through what they perceived 
    to be nothing other than God's Mighty Arm, and His (Indra's) Divine Presence 
    risen up everywhere against their own spiritual enemies--the children of Cain. 
    For centuries they had tried to reason out of the teachings of Adam, and as 
    they spoke of the imperatives of peace, their adversaries (their own brothers, 
    the children of Cain) continually spoke of war. Atlantean civilization came 
    to its conclusion about sixteen hundred years after the initial revelation 
    to Adam (in the time of the legendary Noah), when the struggle between the 
    children of Light and the children of Darkness was already fully underway 
    in the Western world. The teachings of Adam/Manu had already by that time 
    gone out into the world in their earliest forms. The heavens were already 
    being charted. Perhaps the <i>center</i> (Tipheret) had already been located, 
    and the meanings of it all were already being hidden from the minds of the 
    children of Darkness. Metaphor and allegory, similitude and parable, and the 
    art of <i>story</i> were very early developments in this regard. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">These spiritual adepts--attuned to spiritual 
    reality, always following the course of historical events, always taking the 
    path away from the still-continuing saga of human warfare, and always following 
    the course of the sacred rivers (the spiritual rivers that flowed out of Eden 
    into all the other regions of the earth)--emerged with their teachings and 
    their understanding of the Universe on the plains of Mesopotamia. Continuing 
    Eastward they found their way to India and gave rise to Vedic culture. (One 
    cannot interpret the historical framework of Hebrew thought if they are not 
    familiar with the structure of ideas that are present in the Vedas and the 
    other classic Hindu texts...Please see Chapter 4). </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="+1">These beliefs were also carried to Egypt, and 
    built in those earliest of times into the structures of the great pyramids, 
    and inscribed hieroglyphically onto the temple walls of ancient Egypt. What 
    were built and inscribed there was the mysteries of the West, and above that, 
    the things that were already being concealed in the higher regions of human 
    consciousness, in the North--things that would be revealed and come to pass 
    in the fulness of times. Thus the words: <i>And Moses was learned in all the 
    wisdom of the Egyptians</i>...(Acts 7:22). Egypt (a symbol of the entire Western 
    world), is the base upon which God built the structure of the post-Deluvian

  <p align="left"><font size="+1">These earliest of spiritual adepts understood 
    that this process of creation had only been set in motion at the time of their 
    spiritual parents in the garden of Eden. Through visions, insights, dreams 
    and premonitions, and through the corresponding unfolding of historical events, 
    they realized that it was a process that would not come to its conclusion 
    until a great cycle of human history had completed itself, and when all of 
    the ideas that first began to impress themselves upon the mind of Adam/Manu 
    came to fruition at the end of the age. They also perceived how thoroughly, 
    and how perfectly, the sons and daughters of Adam had already fallen away 
    from the precepts of Light, and, sadly, how they yielded instead, not only 
    to the subtle distortions of those teachings but to the fearful and violent 
    influences of Cain, and of all the other <i>Nimrods </i>who appeared in succession 
    in the earth now, one after another, to lead the mind of the people captive. 
    (Please consider the chapter entitled <i>Cain and Nimrod</i> in the Addendum 
    to this work). The struggle between the Mind of Light and the Mind of Darkness 
    was well underway, and it would lead inexorably to the time of Christ and 
    back to the garden of Eden, to the roots of the World Tree, and to <i>the 
    Great Falling Away</i> that has occurred again here in America in our time.

  <p align="left"><font size="+1">What were Adam's instructions to their congregation 
    (to their <i>Church</i> as it were, and subsequently to all of her children 
    throughout time...Ephesians 5:31.32)? Basically this: There is only One Reality, 
    and that Reality is God. Look now into the world of that Reality. What ever 
    you behold, and what ever you are capable of understanding, that is God. God 
    is all that exists. Behold the forces of Nature. That is God. Behold the elements 
    of Nature. That is God. See how these forces and elements come together, spin, 
    clash, appear and disappear, ordering the world from day to day, season to 
    season, and year to year. That is God. These forces are not in opposition 
    to themselves. You yourselves are the work of those forces, you are made of 
    these very same elements--Air above, Earth below, Water and Fire--understand 
    your relationship to them. Be in harmony with them. Inherit the age to come...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1"> Now look beyond the village, all around you, 
    over those mountains, across the sea. Consider that tribe of people over there 
    that you are afraid of, that warrior band, the ones that you are arming yourselves 
    against in case they should decide to attack you. What does it tell you about 
    God? Yes, you understand it right, God is <i>Terrible</i> (2 Corinthians 5:11; 
    Hebrews 10:31). He is a <i>God of War</i>. (Exodus 15:1-3). He is a <i>Consuming 
    Fire</i>. (Deuteronomy 4:23-35). Let that understanding sink down into your 
    soul, into your collective state of consciousness, so that when you come to 
    the end of the age you will not be found waging war against God--the very 
    One who will be risen up in all of His Glory in those times, in the sum of 
    every natural and historical event. Believe us, the prophets said, if you 
    do not follow these instructions God will destroy you from off the Face of 
    the earth. This is why God has sent us into the world, to tell you of these 
    things, and to warn you again and again, in case you forget, and in case you 
    should choose instead to follow your own natural instincts (Ezekiel 33) and, 
    worse of all, if you choose to follow the fearful and violent instincts of 
    those antichrists who will have risen up powerful in the earth in those times. 
    (Hebrews 12:18-29). If you do follow these instructions God will bequeath 
    to you, not only a fruitful life upon the earth but in the heavens above, 
    and universes beyond. This is the heritage of those who overcome, and who 
    are created at last in <i>the image of God</i>...</font></p>

    sefirot on the Tree of Life named Love and Power, Endurance and Majesty) who 
    have walked throughout time in the continuing revelations of God, and who 
    have from time to time been called upon to suffer and die for justice and 
    righteousness' sake--for the Mystery of God's sake. (Our's is such a time).

    those--the simple, the humble, and even those who did not call themselves

  <p><font size="+1">The timeline on the Right side of the oracle represents the 
    Written Law. The literal precepts and statutes of the Torah were handed down 
    to the world along that line which led from the figure of Moses to the time 
    of Christ, when Paul--a Pharisee, and rigid literalist--appears in the story 
    of Israel. Talmudic Judaism knows this rabbi by the name <i>Elisha ben Abuyah</i>, 
    and called him <i>A'her, </i>&quot;the one who goes by another, or assumed, 
    name.&quot; (Please see Chapter 8, and study the Epistles of Paul in this 
    light). The Torah experienced a crisis of interpretation in that time, one 
    that altered the course of history: <i>He seems to be a setter forth of strange 
    gods, </i>they said:<i> because he preached unto them Jesus </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Hesus-Crishna--the 
    composite figure of the Druid's Hesus and the Vedic Crishna)</font><font size="+1"><i>, 
    and the resurrection.</i> (Acts 17:17-20). Those who adhered to the teachings 
    of Paul (and John the Baptist before him), departed from the written, or purely 
    literal dimensions of the Torah, following instead the secret, hidden, pathways 
    in the Torah that led inwards, into the mysteries that were being concealed 
    from the eyes of the world all those centuries. These pathways led into the 
    center of the Oracle, to the place named Beauty on the World Tree. (Deuteronomy 
    12). And then these mysteries were sealed up, with <i>Seven Seals</i>, and 
    hidden from the eyes of the world again, so that the mind of Darkness in the 
    earth could not discover them, <i>And take hold of the Tree of Life</i>, as 
    it were, <i>and live</i>. (Revelation 5:1; 10:7-11).</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The Written Torah itself, however, still had to be safeguarded 
    and preserved so that its purpose and its relationship to its own meanings 
    were not lost, or forgotten, as the children of Israel spread themselves out 
    across the earth, as <i>the stars of heaven</i>, and <i>as the sand of the 
    sea</i> for multitude. Thus by the end of the second century the Spirit had 
    already separated a remnant of Jews from all the rest, charging them, not 
    only with putting a hedge around the Written Torah, but with getting inside 
    of that fence themselves, and staying there until they were told to come out 
    of it in the last days. These are those of whom it was written: <i>No man 
    also having drunk old wine straightaway desireth new: for he saith the old 
    is better. </i>(Luke 5:39). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Having passed the Written law down for safekeeping--(in essence, 
  the process of the Torah, which was completed and codified, it is said, in the 
  time of Ezra, and perfected, it is said, by the Talmudic sages and rabbis who 
  have risen up since...We shall see. There is much that the rabbis will have 
  to repent of also, right alongside of Christianity)--Moses then took the mind 
  of Israel aside, and said: &quot;This is the Torah, the Written Law. If you 
  obey it <i>LITERALLY</i>--in all of its <i>literal</i> dimensions (the stories 
  of Israel's wars for instance, which are purely allegorical)--you will die. 
  Thus the words: <i>For the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</i> (2 
  Corinthians 3:6). If you approach the Torah with an impure heart, uninspired, 
  and without regard for the depths and heights of its meanings, you will surely 
  die. If you reject God's sabbaths (the true meanings of God's statutes) or the 
  teachers and prophets who bring you these meanings, you will most certainly 
  die.&quot; (Paul will later say: <i>When the law came, I died..</i>Romans 7:6-12).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Woe to those who see in the 
    law only simple narratives and ordinary words: Were this really the case, 
    then we could, even today, comprise a law equally worthy of admiration. But 
    it is all quite otherwise...Every word of the Law contains an elevated sense 
    and a sublime mystery...The narratives of the Law are but the raiment in which 
    the (Higher) Law is clothed. Woe unto him who mistakes the garment for the 
    Law itself. It was to avert such a calamity that David prayed <i>Open my eyes 
    that I might behold wondrous things out of Thy law. </i>Another passage states 
    similarly: ...If the Law consisted of ordinary words and narratives like the 
    stories of Esau, Hagar,and Laban, or like the words spoken by Balaam's ass 
    or by Balaam himself, why should it have been called the Law of Truth, the 
    Perfect Law, the Faithful Testimony of God?&quot;<i> </i></font>Introduction 
    to the Zohar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Having taken the mind of Israel aside, <i>Moses</i> then expounded 
  the Oral Law--<i>Kabbalah</i>. Looking way off into the future the prophet expounded 
  the true, epic, allegorical and metaphorical meanings of the Torah, the parables 
  and the stories that would guide and inform the mind of Light in the times to 
  come, and then committed these to Aaron and the priests, the Levites. These 
  Oral traditions were passed down on a line that led along the Left, or lower 
  side of the Oracle (the Solar side), from Aaron to the time of the Essene, John 
  the Baptist, to our own time--the time of Endurance as it is written: <i>Those 
  who endure to the end shall be saved.</i> (Matthew 24:13). The people, having 
  <i>received</i> the oral transmission, then followed the story of Joshua, not 
  into a promised <i>land</i> (in the literal sense of the word), but up into 
  the hidden center of the Oracle, into a Promised State of Mind; for <i>Moses</i> 
  had instructed the people at that time, telling them clearly that the only <i>land</i> 
  they were allowed to rule over with authority and force was the land, and the 
  empire, of their own individual souls. These are among the sublime mysteries 
  that were enacted again in the time of Christ as the brother and sisterhood 
  of Essenes disappeared before the Roman onslaught of that city in the East, 
  and reappeared again in that City that was being concealed in the center of 
  the Tree of Life--in the center of Europe. (Open up the Book of Acts):</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For, behold, the days come, and it shall be when the signs 
    which I have foretold you come to pass, then shall the City which is invisible 
    appear, and the land which is concealed be seen; and whosoever is delivered 
    from the predicted evils shall see my wonders...</font></i><font size="+1">(4

    stored up in the words (in which the rational soul of the student begins to

    in the mirror of the words and names,catching sight of the extraordinary Beauties

<p><font size="+1">These are also the same doctrines that some of the Essenes 
  secretly brought back into the mainstream of Judaism with them in the form of 
  the <i> Merkabah</i> mysteries which would inform later generations of Kabbalists, 
  in which Jesus (the Druid <i>Hesus</i>), the Sacrificial Passover Lamb suspended 
  on the limbs of the Cosmic Tree, reverts to His own Higher nature as the Metatron--the 
  Angel of Divine Presence who goes before the Mind of Israel, and brings it into 
  the <i>Land</i> <i>of Promise</i>. (Exodus 23:20-33; 24:12-18). What is the 
  mystery of the Cross? Simply that one must, indeed, die to their old nature, 
  and to all of their old ways of understanding reality before they can enter 
  this State of Mind. This is the same Angel of Divine Presence who flew into 
  the World Trade Center on September 11, and the very same who is risen up everywhere 
  in the world now, in all of the Powers of the earth, to make war against the 
  rulers of the Western world. (Revelation 19:11-21). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus a</font><font size="+1">mong all these things that were 
  being both revealed and concealed--not only from Christianity itself (but from 
  Judaism and Islam as well)--was the early Church's understanding of the last 
  days, and how they would unfold, and the way (as well as the place on the Tree 
  of Life) in which the Two Anointed Ones would be revealed. (Please see Chapter 
  5 in this regard). They understood that one Remnant would come to perfection 
  on the Left side of the Oracle--the side of Levi, or the <i>Christian</i> side</font><font size="+1"> 
  as it were--and that another Remnant would come to perfection on the Right side 
  of the Oracle--the side of <i>Judah</i> as it is. And therefore the words:</font></p>
