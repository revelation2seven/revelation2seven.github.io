<p><font size="+1">The following commentary is from the <i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i>:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KITTIM...the name of a place and 
    its inhabitants. In the table of nations Kittim is mentioned among the sons 
    of Javan and the brothers of Elishah (Gen.10:4). Josephus (Ant.1:28) identified 
    Kittim with Kition, or Kitti, a Phoenician city on the island of Cyprus near 
    present-day Larnaca, an identification accepted by most scholars...</font></p>
  <p>(You will recall from the earlier chapters that we have placed the original 
    Phoenicians out beyond the Pillars of Hercules, in the Atlantic, and Josephus 
    actually says:</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;</font>Of the three sons 
    of Javan<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font>also, the son of 
    Japhet, Elisa gave name to the Eliseans, who were his subjects; they are now 
    the Aeolians. <i>Tharsus</i> to the Tharsians; for so was Cilicia <i>of old</i> 
    called; the sign of which is this, that the noblest city they have, and a 
    metropolis also, is <i>Tarsus</i>, the <i>tau</i> being by change put for 
    the <i>theta</i>. Cethimus possessed the island Cethima; it is now called 
    Cyprus: and from that it is that <i>ALL ISLANDS</i>, <i>AND THE GREATEST PART 
    OF THE SEA COASTS</i>, are named Cethim (or Cyprus) by the Hebrews: and one 
    city there is in Cyprus that has been able to preserve its denomination; it 
    is called Citius by those who use the language of the Greeks, and has not, 
    by the use of that dialect, escaped the name of Cethim.&quot; <font size="2">Josephus' 
    Antiquities, Book I.VI.1, William Whiston Edition</font>.</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many scholars identify Elishah 
    with Cyprus, or with part of it, and in Ezekiel 27:6-7, Elishah is mentioned 
    along with Kittim as a place that traded with Tyre. Kittim is used in connection 
    with Tyre and Sidon in Isaiah 23:1,12. In these verses Kittim refers not only 
    to a city but also to a land, and to islands (Ezek.26:7). Jeremiah 2:10 mentions 
    the isles of Kittim AS THE SYMBOL OF THE WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE WORLD. Apparently 
    </font>(the author of this article will say)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    the Israelites used the name Kittim to include the islands of the Aegean Sea 
    and even the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea. There is no foundation 
    for the opinion of some scholars that ancient Kittim is in Asia Minor, but 
    various passages in the Bible indicate A CONNECTION BETWEEN KITTIM AND ASSYRIA 
    </font>(the original Assyria in the West; see Chapter 2)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    There is an obscure verse in the prophecies of Balaam, which seem to say: 
    &quot;Ships come from the quarter of Kittim: they subject Ashur, subject Eber. 
    They too shall perish forever&quot;. (Num.24:24). The proximity of Kittim 
    to Assyria in this verse seems to have been the cause of an alteration in 
    the text of Ezek.27:6. The phrase &quot;bat-Ashurim&quot;<i> </i>in the masoretic 
    text of this verse probably originally read &quot;bi-t'ashurim,&quot; &quot;with 
    cypress(?) wood&quot; (cf. Isa.41:19; 60:13), and it is this wood that Ezekiel 
    describes as brought &quot;from the coastlands of Kittim.&quot; The very obscure 
    statement of Isaiah 23:12-13 seems to say that Assyria conquered Kittim...It 
    is evident that Daniel's prediction, &quot;But ships of Kittim shall come 
    against him&quot;<i>...</i>(11:30), is based upon a midrash on Balaam's words 
    which identifies the Kittim with the Romans and Assyria with the Seleucid 
    dynasty of Syria. The identification of Kittim with the Romans was accepted 
    by the Jews in later generations, and served as a basis for eschatological 
    thought in succeeding generations. In 1 Maccabees 1:1 Macedonia is called 
    Kittim...</font>(The author of this commentary is referring here to the connection 
    the author of the Book of 1 Maccabees makes between the apocryphal figure 
    of Alexander the Great and the regions of Greece and Macedonia, associating 
    them with the land of the Chettim. He will not realize, however, the true 
    extent of Alexander's domain, as the Hebrew scribes did--or the fact that 
    he is one of Seven archetypal rulers who prefigure the reign of the antichrists 
    in the last days. Thus the author of 1 Maccabees says of him: <i>And (he) 
    made many wars, and won many strong holds, and slew the kings of the earth. 
    AND HE WENT THROUGH TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH, and took spoils of many nation...</i>1 
    Maccabees 1:2,3. Thus the books of the Maccabees are only partly historical, 
    and form the backdrop for the greater narrative which is mostly apocryphal 
    and prophetic)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) THE WAR OF THE KITTIM...IN 
    A NUMBER OF QUMRAN TEXTS THE KITTIM APPEAR AS THE LAST GENTILE WORLD POWER 
    TO OPPRESS THE PEOPLE OF GOD. In the Habakkuk Commentary<i> </i>from cave 
    1 the prophet's &quot;Chaldeans&quot; are understood to be the Kittim, sent 
    by God to execute His judgment on the godless rulers of Judea but destined, 
    because of their unconscionable rapacity, to be the object of His judgment 
    in turn. In a fragmentary commentary on Isaiah from cave 4, the advance and 
    downfall of the Assyrians (Isa.10:22ff.) is interpreted as the &quot;war of 
    the Kittim:&quot;...The &quot;war of the Kittim&quot; is described in detail 
    in the War Scroll: early in this document the sons of light take the field 
    against &quot;the bands of th Kittim of Asshur and with them as helpers those 
    who deal wickedly against the covenant&quot; (1 QM 1:2) and after dealing 
    with them proceed against the [king] of the Kittim in Egypt...While the word 
    &quot;king&quot; in this last quotation is conjectural...the context suggests 
    that this is an interpretation of &quot;the king of the south&quot; of Daniel 
    11:40. Later in the scroll, in what may be an annex to the main work, the 
    fighting men &quot;encamp against the king of the Kittim and the whole host 
    of Belial.&quot; (1 QM 15:2). The &quot;Kittim of Asshur&quot; probably had 
    their base in Syria; but Kittim and Asshur seem to be used interchangeably 
    in the scroll: thus, when the sons of Belial are destroyed, &quot;Asshur shall 
    come to his end; none shall help him (a quotation from Dan.11:45) and the 
    dominion of the Kittim shall pass away, that wickedness may be brought low 
    with no survivor and that there may be no deliverance for all the sons of 
    darkness.&quot; (1 QM 1:6ff). In such a passage Asshur (Assyria), as in Isaiah, 
    IS PROBABLY A TERM TO DENOTE THE (LAST) OPPRESSOR OF ISRAEL, whereas Kittim 
    indicates more precisely where this oppressor comes from...</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) IN THE HABAKKUK COMMENTARY. 
    The same conclusion is probably indicated by the evidence of the Habakkuk 
    Commentary. THERE THE KITTIM ARE A WORLD POWER, PURSUING A CAREER OF CONQUEST 
    AND EMPIRE FROM THE WEST. In their irresistable advance they overwhelm all 
    who stand in their way and bring them under their own rule. They take possession 
    of many lands and plunder the cities of the earth; they carry on negotiations 
    with other nations in a spirit of cunning and deceit; they lay their subversive 
    plans in advance and tolerate no opposition in carrying them to execution. 
    Their lust for conquest is insatiable; they mock at kings and rulers; fortress 
    after fortress falls before them. THEIR LEADERS FOLLOW ONE ANOTHER IN QUICK 
    SUCCESSION: &quot;they come one after another to destroy the earth.&quot; 
    This rapid replacement happens &quot;by the counsel of the guilty house.&quot; 
    They exact tribute so heavy as to impoverish the lands which have to pay for 
    it; their methods of warfare do not spare men, women, and the tiniest children. 
    The prophet's description of the Chaldeans as catching men like fish and then 
    paying divine honors to their nets is said to denote the Kittim's practice 
    of offering sacrifice to their standards and worshipping their weapons. This 
    last feature of the Kittim is reminiscent of the fact that Roman military 
    standards were treated as sacred objects, PARTICULARLY THE EAGLE, the legendary 
    standard, which was kept in a special shrine in the camp and was regarded 
    as affording sanctuary... The Encyclopedia Judaica.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The following is from <i>The Dead Sea Scriptures, </i>by Theodor 
  H. Gaster:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>HABAKKUK, CHAPTER ONE</p>
  <p><font size="+1">(4) <i>Therefore the law is numbed. </i>This refers to the 
    fact that they have rejected </font><font size="+1">the <i>Torah</i>--that 
    is, the Law of God.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For the wicked besets the righteous...</font></i><font size="+1">The 
    reference (in the word 'righteous') is to the teacher who expounds the Law 
    aright.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefor justice is perverted.</font></i></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(5) <i>Look ye traitors, and see: marvel and be astonished. 
    For it is in your own days that the deed is being done. Ye do not believe 
    when it is told. </i>This refers to the traitors who have aligned themselves 
    with the Man of Lies. For they did not believe what he who expounded the Law 
    aright told them on the authority of God. It refers also to those who betrayed 
    the new covenant, for the word rendered 'believe' also means 'keep faith' 
    and therefore alludes to the fact that they have not kept faith with the Covenant 
    of God, but have profaned His Holy Name. Again, it refers to future traitors--that 
    is, to the lawless men who will betray the Covenant and not believe when they 
    hear all the things that are to come upon the final age duly related by the 
    priest whom God appoints to interpret in those days all the words of His servants 
    the prophets by whom He has told of that impending disaster.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(6) <i>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that wild and impetuous 
    nation. </i>This refers to the Kittians, who are indeed swift and mighty in 
    war, bent on destroying peoples far and wide and subduing them to their own 
    domination. They disposses...but do not believe in the ordinances of God. 
    Over lowland and plain they come to smite and pillage the cities of the land. 
    This is what the Scripture means when it speaks of them as coming <i>to possess 
    dwellings that are not their own.</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(7) <i>Dreadful and artful it is: out of itself proceed both 
    its standards of justice and its (lust) for deception. </i>This refers to 
    the Kittians, the terror and the dread of whom are upon all the nations. Moreover, 
    when they meet in their council, all their plans are directed to doing evil; 
    and they behave towards all peoples with knavery and deceit.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(8, 9) <i>Swifter than leopards are their steeds, and keener 
    than Evening wolves. Their horsemen spread out and ride abroad: they come 
    flying from afar like a vulture (an eagle) that hasteth to devour. They all 
    of them come for violence: the serried mass of their faces is a veritable 
    eastwind. </i>This refers to the Kittians who thresh the earth with their 
    horses and their beasts. Like a vulture they come from afar, FROM THE ISLES 
    OF THE SEA, to devour all the nations; and they are insatiable. In the heat 
    of fury, in searing rage, in scorching anger and with tempestuous mein they 
    speak with all the peoples; and this is what the Scripture means when it says, 
    <i>the serried mass of their faces is a veritable eastwind, and they amass 
    spoil like sand.</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(10) <i>At kings it scoffs, and lordlings are a derision 
    unto it. </i>This refers to the fact that they scorn the great and mock the 
    noble, make sport of kings and princes, and scoff at any numerous people.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">It derides every stronghold: piles up an earthmound and 
    takes it. </font></i><font size="+1">This refers to the Kittians who scorn 
    the strongholds of the peoples and tauntingly derides them, surrounding them 
    with a great host in order to capture them. Through alarm and terror the latter 
    are surrendered into their hands, and they overthrow them through the iniquity 
    of those who dwell in them.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(11) <i>Then the wind sweeps by and passes: and another, 
    whose might is his God, proceeds to wreak devastation. </i>This refers to 
    the rulers of the Kittians. In their guilt-ridden Council House <font size="3">(in 
    Washington)</font> they keep replacing those rulers one after another, and 
    each comes in turn to destroy the earth...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(13) <i>Why dost thou look (idly) upon traitors, and keep 
    silent when the wicked confounds him that is more righteous than he? </i>This 
    refers to the house of Absalom and their cronies who kept silent when charges 
    were levelled against the teacher who was expounding the Law aright, and who 
    did not come to his aid against the man of lies when the latter rejected the 
    <i>Torah</i> in the midst of the entire congregation.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(14-16) <i>Thou hast made men like fishes of the sea, like 
    crawling things, that he may have dominion over them. He takes up all of them 
    with the angle and hauls them in his net, and gathers them in his drag. Therefore 
    he sacrifices to his net: therefore he rejoices and makes merry; therefore 
    too, he burns incense to his net: because thereby his portion is rich. </i>This 
    again refers to the Kittians. What with all their plunder, they keep increasing 
    their wealth like a shoal of fish. And as for the statement, <i>therefore 
    he sacrifices unto his net and burns incense to his drag, </i>this refers 
    to the fact that they offer sacrifices unto their ensigns and their weapons 
    are are objects of veneration to them...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">CHAPTER TWO</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(1, 2) <i>I will take my stand on my watch and post myself 
    on my tower, and scan the scene to see whereof He will denounce me and what 
    answer I might give when He arraigns me. And the Lord took up up a word with 
    me and said: Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets that he may 
    run who reads it. </i>God told (the prophet) to write down the things that 
    were to come upon the latter age, but He did not inform him when that moment 
    would come to fulfilment. As to the phrase, <i>that he who reads may run</i>, 
    this refers to the teacher who expounds the Law aright, for God has made him 
    <i>au courant</i> with all the deeper implications of the words of His servants 
    the prophets.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(3) <i>For the vision is yet for the appointed time. Though 
    it lags toward the moment, it will not be belied. </i>This refers to the fact 
    that the final moment may be protracted beyond anything which the prophets 
    have foretold, for 'God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform.'</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Though it tarry, yet await it; for it will surely come, 
    it will not delay; </font></i><font size="+1">This is addressed to the men 
    of truth, the men who carry out the Law, who do not relax from serving the 
    Truth even though the final moment be long drawn out. Assuredly all the times 
    appointed by God will come in due course, even as He has determined in His 
    inscrutable wisdom.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(4) <i>Behold, his soul shall be swollen, not reduced therein. 
    </i>This refers to the fact that they will pile up for themselves a Double 
    requital for their sins, and shall not be quit of judgment for them.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But the righteous through their faithfulness shall live. 
    </font></i><font size="+1">This refers to all Jewry (all Israel) who carry 
    out the Law. On account of their labor and of their faith in him who expounded 
    the Law aright, God will deliver them from the house of judgment. </font>The 
    Dead Sea Scriptures<font size="+1">.</font></p>
