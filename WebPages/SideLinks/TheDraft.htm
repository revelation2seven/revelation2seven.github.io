<p align="center">KUCINICH: IRAQ POLICY WILL LEAD TO DRAFT</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - America's policy in Iraq will lead to a resumption 
    of the military draft, Democrat Dennis Kucinich told high school and college 
    students Saturday. </p>
  <p>&quot;The body count keeps rising,'' Kucinich said, pointing to reports of 
    more deaths in Iraq. We are not that far away from this country moving toward 
    a draft,'' he said. ``It's just inevitable because the number of troops are 
    going down and the U.S. commitments are worldwide and there is a point at 
    which that is the next step.'' After his speech, Kucinich said he was not 
    trying to stir up unreasonable fears. &quot;These kids' lives are on the line,'' 
    he said. </p>
  <p>Kucinich took rival John Kerry to task for proposing to create two more divisions 
    of troops at a time when many soldiers and reservists are not re-enlisting. 
    &quot;Where are those people going to come from,'' Kucinich asked. </p>
  <p>He acknowledged that Kerry opposes the draft, but said ``I am the only person 
    running for president who has challenged the president going in (to Iraq), 
    challenged the president on staying in and offered a plan to get our troops 
    out.'&quot; Kerry has said he would expand the Army to raise two new divisions. 
    He has not said he would send them to Iraq. </p>
  <p>Kucinich proposes the United States turn over peacekeeping, managing oil 
    assets and rebuilding contract awards in Iraq to the United Nations so American 
    troops can come home. He also wants the United States to help pay for the 
    U.N. occupation; pay to rebuild what it has destroyed in Iraq and pay the 
    families of civilians who were killed.</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Nothing was certain until after 
  Registration Day, June 5, 1917, when 10 million American boys between the ages 
  of 21 and 31 were required by a new and controversial Selective Service Act 
  to register their names with the government at local draft offices. Conscription 
  was the old term for it, AND IT MEANT FORCING MEN INTO MILITARY SERVICE. Conscription 
  ran against the American grain. It hadn't been tried since the Civil War, and 
  then it had provoked bloody riots in the streets of New York and elsewhere. 
  Senators and congressmen warned Wilson that there would be riots worse than 
  those of the Civil War if he tried to press men into service.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Wilson wanted his troops recruited 
  and trained in an efficient manner; the volunteer system was outdated by the 
  ruthlessness of modern warfare. The efficient way to raise an army, said Wilson, 
  was to issue to all young and able-bodied men a number, throw the numbers into 
  a fishbowl, draw the numbers out of the bowl and draft into uniform the men 
  whose number came up first. Over the protests of (various legislators who called 
  the law both undemocratic and unconstitutional), the Selective Service Act was 
  passed into law. Thus on June 5, 10 million young Americans were expected to 
  report to the polling places in their towns...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everywhere there were reminders of 
  the forthcoming event. Within a border of tiny American flags under the headline

    assignment to their tasks. It is for that reason destined to be remembered 
    as one of the most conspicuous moments in our history. It is nothing less 
    than the day upon which the manhood of the country shall step forward in one 
    solid rank in defense of the ideals to which this nation is consecrated. It 
    is important to those ideals no less than to the pride of this generation 
    in manifesting its devotion to them that there be no gaps in the ranks.</p>

  was the test day, the moment of truth for the government's war policy. Riots

  could seriously embarrass Wilson. The transformation of public attitudes so 
  essential for waging war efficiently would then be shown to be incomplete.</font></p>

  WILSON'S CRUSADE AND BUSH'S CRUSADE<br>
  by James Bovard, October 2003<b> </b></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>George Bush&#146;s promise to &#147;rid the world of evil&#148; &#151; which 
    he made in the opening weeks of his war on terrorism &#151; is reminiscent 
    of the 1917 promises of President Woodrow Wilson to &#147;make the world safe 
    for democracy.&#148; Wilson, like Bush, was leading the nation into war and 
    sought to push the hot buttons in Americans&#146; idealism. Unfortunately, 
    for both Bush and Wilson, the loftier their promises soared, the deeper the 
    hooey became. Wilson portrayed World War I as a moral absolute. And because 
    the United States was involved in a crusade to do absolute good, any criticism 
    or opposition to government policies quickly became perceived as evil. In 
    his superb new book, The Illusion of Victory: America in World War I, historian 
    Thomas Fleming recreates the political and moral atmosphere of the period 
    when America entered World War I. The parallels to the current war on terrorism 
    are breathtaking. Fleming concludes, </p>
  <p>Worst of all was Wilson&#146;s tendency to utopianism &#151; the truly fatal 
    flaw in his dream of flexing America&#146;s idealized muscles in the name 
    of peace...</p>

  <p>...Wilson twisted the facts to portray a U.S. war against Germany as a battle 
    of good versus evil. In the same way that Bush portrays terrorists as the 
    worst and most implacable enemies of freedom, Wilson denounced the German 
    government as &#147;the natural foe to liberty.&#148; Wilson portrayed submarine 
    warfare as a crime against humanity &#151; similar to Bush&#146;s portrayal 
    of Iraq&#146;s alleged weapons of mass destruction. Yet, the U.S. government 
    soon changed its tune on submarines, relying on them as a key weapon against 
    Japan in the Second World War. Wilson stirred anti-German sentiment by denouncing 
    Germans as &#147;imperialists.&#148; Fleming notes, </p>
  <p>One is almost boggled by the way Wilson fastened this term of opprobrium 
    on Germany, while England and France between them had several hundred million 
    people in their colonial grip. Wilson was correct that Germany had imperial 
    ambitions &#151; as did the United States. Many Americans had been harshly 
    critical of abuses committed by U.S. forces after the United States seized 
    the Phillippines. Indeed, </p>
  <p>John White, an Ohio farmer, received 21 months in the penitentiary for declaring 
    that the murder of women and children by German soldiers [in Belgium] was 
    no worse than the crimes that American soldiers committed in the Philippines 
    during the 1900&#150;1902 insurrection there. At the time the U.S. government 
    entered World War I, the Wilson administration possessed paltry information 
    on the war&#146;s realities. The British government had deluged the United 
    States with a propaganda campaign and also managed to censor almost all the 
    news coming from Europe (including Germany) to America. As a result, Americans 
    assumed that France, Britain, and Russia were likely to win the war and that 
    the Germans were struggling badly. Many Americans expected that it would not 
    even be necessary to send an American army to Europe after declaring war. 
    In reality, by April 1917 Russia was on the verge of being completely knocked 
    out of the war and the French army was mutinying, as soldiers had lost all 
    patience after years of being sacrificed by half-wit generals who still could 
    not grasp the importance of the machine gun in modern warfare. Wilson, like 
    Bush, saw nearly boundless executive power as a key to winning the war. </p>
  <p>Fleming notes that in early 1918 Wilson sent the Senate a bill that gave 
    him the power to reorganize the entire government; he wanted to be able to 
    create, merge or abolish agencies and bureaus without so much as a by-your-leave 
    from Congress, and generally operate as the autocrat to end all autocrats. 
    One senator said the bill would make Wilson a king; all he needed to do was 
    claim to rule by divine right and he and the kaiser would be twins. This is 
    similar to the response that Sen. Robert Byrd (D&#150;W. Va.) had to Bush&#146;s 
    Homeland Security Department bill. Similarly, some of the military and other 
    appropriations bills that the Bush administration sent Congress aimed to greatly 
    reduce legislative control and oversight of how the executive branch spends 
    tax dollars. Dissent, and civil liberties Fleming drives home how the war 
    hysteria and hatred of Germans that Wilson and his team whipped up quickly 
    led to the suppression of free speech: </p>
  <p>A Philadelphia socialist was sentenced to six months in jail for possession 
    of an antiwar pamphlet, &#147;Long Live the Constitution of the United States.&#148; 
    The U.S. Supreme Court eventually upheld the sentence; liberal Justice Oliver 
    Wendell Holmes affirmed the legality of the Espionage Act under the doctrine 
    that in time of war, antigovernment critics can be &#147;a clear and present 
    danger&#148; to victory. The fans of Justice Holmes &#151; who like to portray 
    him as a hero of civil liberties &#151; usually choose to ignore his role 
    in sanctifying the Wilson administration&#146;s crushing of dissent. Vice 
    President Marshall said every American &#147;&#145;not heartily of the government&#146; 
    should have his citizenship revoked and his property confiscated,&#148; Fleming 
    notes. The Bush administration has not gone so far as to urge boundless government 
    power over anyone who dissents. However, some conservatives these days are 
    openly portraying any opposition to the war on terrorism as traitorous. Wilson 
    massively exploited the war to throttle his political opponents. </p>
  <p>On May 27, 1918, in the prelude to the congressional elections later that 
    year, he announced, Politics is adjourned. The elections will go to those 
    who think least of it; to those who go to their constituents without explanations 
    or excuses, with a plain record of duty faithfully and disinterestedly performed. 
    Yet, shortly before the November elections, &#147;Wilson released a public 
    letter ... crushing the enemy with the accusation of disloyalty in wartime.&#148; 
    The Germany army largely collapsed in October 1918. Wilson&#146;s Democratic 
    Party very likely expected to receive huge rewards at the polling booths from 
    voters for this achievement. However, the year and a half of war fever &#151; 
    of demagoguery &#151; of repression &#151; of economic dislocation &#151; 
    thwarted Wilson&#146;s ambitions. The Republican Party picked up the vast 
    majority of competitive House seats and also scored major gains in the Senate. 
    Thus, just when Wilson thought military victories would make him invincible, 
    he lost control of Congress. The war to end all wars At the start of the war, 
    Wilson sought to assure Americans (including millions of German-Americans), 
    We have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards them 
    but one of sympathy and friendship. </p>
  <p>But such warm feelings quickly dissipated as the war dragged on &#151; and 
    as Wilson became terrified at the prospect of a German victory in 1918. After 
    the Armistice on November 11, 1918, the British perpetuated a naval blockade 
    on Germany that starved tens of thousands of Germans. One justification Wilson 
    offered for U.S. entry into World War I was that it would ensure that the 
    United States would have a &#147;seat at the peace table&#148; and could thereby 
    play a key role in reshaping the world. Yet the fighting had barely stopped 
    before a series of new wars broke out throughout central and eastern Europe. 
    Fleming notes, The French, still obsessed by their fear of Germany, were unilaterally 
    turning the states born of the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian 
    empires into military satellites on Germany&#146;s borders. French officers 
    and weaponry poured into Poland, Czechoslovakia and Rumania. Poland had raised 
    an army of 600,000 and the Czechs 250,000; the Rumanians were industriously 
    imitating them. All these armies began shooting at each other over disputed 
    slices of territory. Ray Stannard Baker, Wilson&#146;s press secretary, glumly 
    informed the president that there were no less than 14 small wars in progress 
    in supposedly pacified Europe. </p>
  <p>Wilson saw the League of Nations as his legacy to America and humanity. During 
    the 1920 presidential election, Wilson urged voters to judge every candidate 
    by one simple standard: &#147;Shall we or shall we not redeem the great moral 
    obligations of the United States?&#148; After all the bogus moralizing of 
    the war years, Americans rejected Wilson&#146;s scheme for world salvation. 
    The League of Nations also went down to defeat because of all the tawdry deals 
    that preceded the final signing. While Wilson constantly portrayed American 
    sacrifices as key to making the world safe for democracy, the British and 
    French exploited the war to forcibly expand their empires and place millions 
    more people under their thumbs. Henry White, one of Wilson&#146;s aides at 
    the Paris peace talks, bemoaned, We had such high hopes of this adventure; 
    we believed God called us and now we are doing hell&#146;s dirtiest work. 
  </p>
  <p>One surprise in Fleming&#146;s book is the role of Irish-Americans in the 
    political destruction of Woodrow Wilson and his League of Nations. The Irish 
    were bitter over brutal British repressions in their homeland. The Irish immigrants 
    in America strongly opposed provisions in the League of Nations that would 
    have sanctified the existing power structure around the world &#151; thereby 
    helping perpetuate British colonial rule in Ireland, India, and many other 
    places. Wilson largely scorned Irish-Americans as troublesome low-lifes. They 
    paid him back with massive rallies, superbly organized information campaigns, 
    and other efforts to whip up opposition. Many Americans feared that, if the 
    U.S. Senate ratified Wilson&#146;s League of Nations without amendments, the 
    U.S. army could be forced to fight abroad in defense of the British colonial 
    empire. World War I also resulted in the rise of an American Taliban on the 
    home front. Prohibition probably never could have been put on the statute 
    books or in the Constitution if not for the exploitation of war fever. Banning 
    alcohol was portrayed as a means to protect troops and to avoid wasting grain 
    and other ingredients for alcohol. Destroying freedom on the home front thus 
    supposedly became vital to helping create freedom abroad. One of the gravest 
    lessons of World War I is that &#147;idealism is not synonymous with sainthood 
    or virtue. It only sounds that way,&#148; as Fleming notes. We should not 
    judge politicians&#146; intentions by the breadth and dazzle of their promises. 
    Lies are lies, regardless of whether the liar promises to save humanity. </p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>About two weeks ago I was speaking with a soldier on leave, who lives with 
    his parents. Like so many, he turned twenty while in Iraq. He told me how 
    much he hated being in Iraq, the sordid details I won't go into. I guess he 
    figured he could talk to me, seeing as I have a rather large sticker on my 
    rear view window that says &quot;Support the troops - bring them home.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>As we continued to talk, I thought he was actually going to break down and 
    cry when he said, &quot;I don't want to go back to that fucking death hole! 
    I'd rather go to jail, but I don't know how to go about it or who the hell 
    to talk to.&quot; I told him the smart thing would be to get lost, and not 
    go back at all. He has no wife or children. I also let him know his commander 
    and chief went AWOL back in the day when the average Joe's son was being slaughtered 
    on an hourly basis in Nam. Those days THE BIG LIE was that we were fighting 
    &quot;the communists.&quot; Today it's &quot;the terrorists.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p>Of course, I don't think he's going to listen to me, but I still think that 
    any American soldier deployed in Iraq who gets his or her feet back on U.S. 
    soil should do everything they can to keep themselves here. The smart thing 
    to do, of course, is not to volunteer in Bush's blood for oil program in the 
    first place. But this poor kid, like so many others, got snookered. They are 
    young fresh out of school, or still in high school when the recruiters come. 
    Young kids think they're invincible. They're caught up by the moment and the 
    propaganda. They don't read any newspapers let alone get themselves on to 
    a good website to see first-hand what a war is really about, and by the time 
    they find out it's too damn late. Once they get in, it's too late to ask questions. 
  </p>
  <p>I think it is our duty as parents to educate and warn our kids now, not tomorrow 
    - before they do something stupid and end up caught in the Bush quagmire like 
    this precious young man. What a terrible situation to be in, to find out you 
    were used because you were vulnerable, and when you come to realize what has 
    happened to you, there is nothing you can do about it. It is like being stuck 
    in quicksand. A quagmire. Iraq has become the Black Flag Hotel, with one very 
    big difference, these are not roaches that are being killed - it's our children! 
    Our husbands! Our wives! <br>
  </p>
  <p>Mr. President, you said in the rose garden yesterday that we are not leaving 
    Iraq. We. You said that we are not going to be intimidated. We, Mr. President

      Report Increased Selective Service Registration Compliance</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> WASHINGTON, DC (June 2003) &#150; States that have joined the national movement 
    to require young men to register with Selective Service before they can renew 
    their driver&#146;s licenses have seen dramatic positive results from their 
    efforts, with increases in registration rates as high as 11 percent. Results 
    of the fourth annual state-by-state registration compliance report released 
    last month by the Selective Service System show that most of the 32 states, 
    two U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia, that have driver&#146;s 
    license legislation showed dramatic increases in compliance rates. The state-by-state 
    report of state registration compliance rates are based on the percentage 
    of draft eligible men who were born in 1983 and had registered by December 
    31, 2002.</p>
  <p>Nationally, registration compliance in 2002 increased to a record 89 percent 
    for men reaching age 19 during the year, up by two points from 2000&#146;s 
    high of 87 percent. Virtually all young men living in the United States are 
    required by Federal law to register with Selective Service when they turn 
    18. While failure to register is a crime punishable by a fine up to $250,000 
    and/or up to five years imprisonment, the government rarely prosecutes men 
    in peacetime who fail to register. However, many Federal opportunities &#150; 
    including eligibility for student loans, job training, Federal employment, 
    and citizenship for male immigrants &#150; are denied to young men who fail 
    to register. Young men who are required to register and do not do so by the 
    time they turn 26 are permanently barred from these opportunities. In addition, 
    cities and counties over the years have taken their own steps to ensure registration. 
    Chicago and New York City, for instance, require young men to be registered 
    if they want municipal jobs with the city, such as police officers or fire 
    fighters.</p>
  <p>Over the past few years, a movement among states to link driver&#146;s license 
    registration and Selective Service registration has been growing. Selective 
    Service has the challenge of reaching more than 5000 young men in America 
    who turn 18 every day with a message that they&#146;re not always interested 
    in hearing. &#147;It&#146;s especially gratifying to see state governments 
    take this issue so seriously,&#148; said Lew Brodsky, acting director of the 
    Selective Service System. &#147;By tying registration directly to something 
    that is a top-of-mind association for pretty much every young man in America 
    &#150; the ability to get a driver&#146;s license &#150; states are sending 
    the clear message that they support registration and expect young men to take 
    their responsibilities seriously.&#148;</p>
  <p>In most states with such legislation, Selective Service works with the Department 
    of Public Safety or Motor Vehicles to include a consent statement on all applications 
    or renewals for driver&#146;s permits, licenses, and identification cards. 
    The statement informs the applicant that by submitting the application he 
    is consenting to being registered with Selective Service if he is required 
    to do so.</p>
  <p>In 2002, states and territories that had begun transmitting registration 
    data made significant gains in their compliance rates. They include Hawaii, 
    posting 11 percent; Georgia (10 percent), Colorado and Illinois (8 percent), 
    Alabama and Arkansas (6 percent), and Ohio and Florida 4 percent). </p>

  <p><b>W A S H I N G T O N, Sept. 18 &#151; Even as the nation's armed forces 
    mobilize for what the commander in chief vows will be an all-out war against 
    international terrorism, THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE THE 
    DRASTIC STEP OF REINSTATING THE MILITARY DRAFT. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p> <b>&quot;We will win the war,&quot; President Bush said at the Pentagon 
    on Monday. &quot;An act of war was declared against America, but this will 
    be a different type of war than we're used to.&quot; Tens of thousands of 
    reservists are now reporting for duty in preparation for that as yet undefined 
    war effort, but experts agree it is highly unlikely that ordinary citizens 
    will be called to duty &#151; something that hasn't happened since the Vietnam 
    War. </b></p>
  <p><b>'ALMOST NO CHANCE,' SAY EXPERTS</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;There is almost no chance that they're going to institute the draft,&quot; 
    says ABC NEWS Military Analyst Anthony Cordesman. &quot;This is not 1940, 
    it's not Korea and it's not Vietnam.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>The United States military has been an all-volunteer force for the last 
    quarter century. And there are many reasons why the government will likely 
    not induct civilians into that force in the wake of last week's terrorist 
    attacks in New York and Washington. </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The problem with the draft is that it normally has short-term stints 
    of military service,&quot; says Kurt Campbell, a former deputy assistant secretary 
    of defense. &quot;But in a sophisticated military organization &#133; it takes 
    a couple of years just to understand your job...&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>What we need are truly well-trained professionals capable of operating 
    very high-technology equipment,&quot; agrees Cordesman. &quot;And the fact 
    is that draftees can't provide those capabilities.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>LARGE SCALE GROUND WAR UNLIKELY</b></p>
  <p><b>Department of Defense officials say the military is preparing to wage 
    a &quot;sustained and broad&quot; campaign against terrorists and those who 
    support them. </b><b>But the operations the Pentagon is planning are likely 
    not on the same scale or of the same nature as America's last armed conflict 
    &#151; the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when the United States deployed more than 
    a half-million servicemen and women to the region in the successful effort 
    to repel Iraqi forces from Kuwait. </b><b>&quot;It's very hard to imagine 
    a military operation on the scale of 'Desert Storm,'&quot; says Campbell. 
    &quot;We're not going to have the same kind of staging areas and I don't think 
    we'll have the same potential uses of ground forces.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>Campbell and other military experts say the United States will likely 
    rely heavily on air and sea power and special forces units, which rarely operate 
    in groups larger than one hundred. </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Draftees are what you need for a mass army when you are fighting 
    a mass enemy in conventional warfare,&quot; says Cordesman. </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The real challenge for us is to avoid situations where we would 
    need to use large numbers of people in a large, on-the-ground effort,&quot; 
    Campbell adds. </b></p>
  <p><b>Michael O'Hanlon, AN EXPERT on defense issues with the Brookings Institution, 
    says even if such an effort does become necessary, it is unlikely to have 
    the manpower requirements that would necessitate a draft. &quot;Even if one 
    imagines a major ground war against Iraq or Afghanistan,&quot; he says, &quot;these 
    are the sorts of things that we've been planning to do with our active duty 
    force for a long time.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>During Operation Desert Storm, some 265,000 reserve and National Guard 
    members were mobilized. Bush, who has the authority to call up as many as 
    1 million reservists, last week ordered the mobilization of some 35,000 to 
    perform &quot;homeland defense&quot; and civil service functions </b><b>&quot;THE

    A COST AND THAT WE'RE WILLING TO BEAR THAT COST,&quot; the president said

  </font>From Robert H. Ballan<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear All, <br>
    I just went to http://www.sss.gov/fslocal.htm and applied to interviewed as 
    a potential member of a local draft board. You can do this also. The application 
    can be filled out online and it is not lengthy. The fact that the Selective 
    Service System is interviewing for these positions sends an unmistakable signal 
    to us that legislation bringing back forced induction into the military which 
    has been lying dormant in the House and Senate is about to move quickly into 
    law. </p>
  <p>For those of us with draft age children, grandchildren or young family members, 
    this is serious issue - a life, disability and death issue. At present, the 
    U.S. military is now all-volunteer but that is about to change. There are 
    those that are willing to be put in harm's way, if ordered to do so by their 
    nation, regardless of the morality of the situation. There are many that are 
    conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form or in unjust wars. 
    If we leave the Draft Boards to those with right wing beliefs, we will have 
    right wing draft boards. I prefer to participate in the system, in a legitimate 
    way to ensure that our youngsters get the fairness and balanced consideration 
    that the seriousness of the situation warrants. </p>
  <p>Admittedly, as a conscientious objector, opposed to all war, I would probably 
    not be appointed by the governor nor even recommended by the Selective Service 
    System. However, I'm trying to fullfil my duty to my country. There may be 
    others who upon reading this message feel the urge to participate in the system 
    to ensure its fairness and compliance with the law. However, I intend to notify 
    my congressman and senators that reinstituting military conscription will 
    inexorably lead to the expansion of our military interventions and adventures 
    in foreign lands and ask them to oppose it. </p>
  <p>It is time to start educating your children regarding conscientious objection. 
    It is also time to start organizing volunteer community draft counseling organizations. 
    Those of you that are interested in serving either as Draft Board members 
    or volunteer counselors, it's time to step up. We can all write letters and 
    express our opposition. As much as anything this is an opportunity to test 
    our ability to network. Get the word out. Let's not allow the public to be 
    taken by surprise. <br>

<p align="center">US PREPARING FOR MILITARY DRAFT IN SPRING 2005</p>
<p align="center">by Adam Stutz &#149; Wednesday January 28, 2004 at 09:50 AM</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The current agenda of the US federal government is to reinstate the draft 
    in order to staff up for a protracted war on &quot;terrorism.&quot; Pending 
    legislation in the House and Senate (twin bills S 89 and HR 163) would time 
    the program so the draft could begin at early as Spring 2005 -- conveniently

  <p>Dear Friends and Family, </p>
  <p>I urge you to read the article below on the current agenda of the federal 
    government to reinstate the draft in order to staff up for a protracted war 
    on &quot;terrorism.&quot; </p>
  <p>Pending legislation in the House and Senate (twin bills S 89 and HR 163) 
    would time the program so the draft could begin at early as Spring 2005 -- 
    conveniently just after the 2004 presidential election! But the administration 
    is quietly trying to get these bills passed NOW, so our action is needed immediately. 
    Details and links follow. </p>
  <p>If voters who currently support U.S. aggression abroad were confronted with 
    the possibility that their own children or grandchildren might not have a 
    say about whether to fight, many of these same voters might have a change 
    of mind. (Not that it should make a difference, but this plan would among 
    other things eliminate higher education as a shelter and would not exclude 
    women -- and Canada is no longer an option.) </p>
  <p>Please send this on to all the parents and teachers you know, and all the 
    aunts and uncles, grandparents, godparents.... And let your children know 
    -- it's their future, and they can be a powerful voice for change! Please 
    also write to your representatives to ask them why they aren't telling their 
    constituents about these bills -- and write to newspapers and other media 
    outlets to ask them why they're not covering this important story. </p>
  <p>The Draft* </p>
  <p>$28 million has been added to the 2004 Selective Service System (SSS) budget 
    to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as June 15, 2005. 
    SSS must report to Bush on March 31, 2005 that the system, which has lain 
    dormant for decades, is ready for activation. Please see website: http://www.sss.gov/perfplan_fy2004.html 
    to view the SSS Annual Performance Plan - Fiscal Year 2004. </p>
  <p>The Pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to fill all 10,350 draft 
    board positions and 11,070 appeals board slots nationwide.. Though this is 
    an unpopular election year topic, military experts and influential members 
    of Congress are suggesting that if Rumsfeld's prediction of a &quot;long, 
    hard slog&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan [and a permanent state of war on &quot;terrorism&quot;] 
    proves accurate, the U.S. may have no choice but to draft. </p>
  <p>http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5146.htm </p>
  <p>Congress brought twin bills, S. 89 and H.R. 163 forward this year, entitled 
    the Universal National Service Act of 2003, &quot;To provide for the common 
    defense by requiring that all young persons [age 18--26] in the United States, 
    including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian 
    service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and 
    for other purposes.&quot; These active bills currently sit in the Committee 
    on Armed Services. </p>
  <p>Dodging the draft will be more difficult than those from the Vietnam era 
    remember. College and Canada will not be options. In December 2001, Canada 
    and the US signed a &quot;Smart Border Declaration,&quot; which could be used 
    to keep would-be draft dodgers in. Signed by Canada's Minister of Foreign 
    Affairs, John Manley, and US Homeland Security Director, Gov. Tom Ridge, the 
    declaration involves a 30-point plan which implements, among other things, 
    a &quot;pre-clearance agreement&quot; of people entering and departing each 
    country. Reforms aimed at making the draft more equitable along gender and 
    class lines also eliminates higher education as a shelter. Underclassmen would 
    only be able to postpone service until the end of their cur-rent semester. 
    Seniors would have until the end of the academic year. </p>

  <p>Yes, just go along with this 'draft', like a good little Nazi, you think 
    you can change things from the inside of a draftboard? You're nuts! You just 
    want to play 'godling' and decide who goes, who stays. Yours stay, mine and 
    'others', go. B... everybody 'stays', because we are all conscientiously opposing 
    a draft, not letting the ptb, soon to be the ptw (powers that 'were'), call 
    the next shots. Nobody is 'going' anywhere, we need every man (and womwn) 
    jack, one of us, to STAY and defend the constitutional republic and what's 
    left of it!</p>
  <p> &quot;They would have to revisit the entire process of how a call-up would 
    work,&quot; says Campbell. &quot;Very little thought has been given to how 
    you would re-institute it.&quot; According to current plans, men ages 20 to 
    25 would be eligible, with 20-year-olds the first to be drafted. A lottery 
    based on birth dates would be used to determine the order in which people 
    are called up. </p>
  <p>&quot;You wouldn't want to get to the situation we had in Vietnam where the 
    rich could 'buy' their way out and educate their way out of the draft,&quot; 
    says O'Hanlon. &quot;That was a divisive approach that I think we would want 
    to avoid.&quot; During most of the Vietnam War, any college student was eligible 
    for a deferment from the draft. Current Selective Service guidelines, however, 
    would allow a college student to postpone his induction only until the end 
    of the semester. </p>
  <p>A system is also in place to draft a &quot;very small percentage&quot; of 
    the nation's doctors and nurses into military service if the need arises. 
    All health-care workers between the ages of 20 and 45 &#151; both men and 
    women &#151; would be obligated to register. As with a general military service 
    draft, a so-called medical draft would require the approval of Congress and 
    the president. </p>
  <p>&quot;The Selective Service System remains in a standby, caretaker status,&quot; 
    the agency said in a statement today. &quot;At this time, there has been no 
    indication from the Congress or the administration that a return to the draft 
    will be necessary.&quot;</p>

  NAMES GIVEN TO MILITARY RECRUITERS<br>
</p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"> District complies with federal act by giving student information; 
      Parents concerned military ads may be misleading </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center">By Alex Katz, STAFF WRITER </p>
  <p>OAKLAND -- Saturday, November 15__The Oakland school district turned over 
    names and phone numbers of almost 4,000 students to military recruiters this 
    week, in a controversial move required to comply with federal law. A provision 
    of President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act gives recruiters special 
    access to names, phone numbers and addresses of high school juniors and seniors. 
  </p>
  <p>Schools sent &quot;opt-out&quot; forms home with students in English, Spanish, 
    Chinese and Vietnamese. About 600 students returned the forms to prevent their 
    information from going to recruiters, district officials said. The Pentagon 
    says the law helps to find young people to defend the country. But some Oakland 
    parents and school officials say recruiting and advertisements for the military 
    can be misleading to children. Military marketing often focuses on adventure 
    and money for college, without any mention of going to war, killing or dying, 
    they say. </p>
  <p>Student names and numbers are still off-limits to college recruiters and 
    other government agencies. Previously, Oakland did not give out student information 
    to anyone without parent permission. &quot;I don't think (recruiters) give 
    a realistic view of what the military is,&quot; said Venus Mesui, parent coordinator 
    at the Street Academy, a small high school that has banned military recruiters 
    from campus. Mesui also works at Fremont High, where she said recruiters' 
    pitches center on money. It's hard for poor students to resist offers of signing 
    bonuses and tens of thousands of dollars for college, she said. &quot;We're 
    talking about teenagers, 16, 17 years old,&quot; Mesui said. &quot;Some of 
    them don't have three dollars in their pocket to buy lunch.&quot; </p>
  <p>Also, she said, &quot;You know the military is now. They're not coming home 
    and when they do, they're coming home in boxes.&quot; </p>
  <p>The district sent names and contact information of juniors and seniors to 
    Jack Meng, an education specialist in a South Bay U.S. Navy recruitment office. 
    Meng could not be reached for comment Friday. Under the No Child Left Behind 
    law, the Oakland schools stood to lose more than $25 million in federal funds 
    if the district did not give out names to recruiters. The school board voted 
    last year to comply with the law, but stressed that parents would be informed 
    they could sign an &quot;opt-out&quot; form to keep their children's names 
    and numbers private. &quot;Most of us felt like it wasn't a good idea because 
    it would be difficult for parents to be informed,&quot; said board member 
    Gary Yee, a former captain in the U.S. Air Force. </p>
  <p>Fremont High journalism teacher Michael Jackson had a less critical view 
    of military recruiters. &quot;Some kids love the structure (of the military), 
    and that's really good for them,&quot; said Jackson, whose son is stationed 
    in Iraq. Also, Fremont High is no stranger to recruiters from colleges, nonprofits, 
    political organizations and even religious groups, Jackson said. &quot;I've 
    taken kids to numerous assemblies that almost turn into prayer meetings,&quot; 
    he said. In the past, recruiters have always been able to call a good number 
    of Oakland students without information from the district. </p>
  <p>Fremont High senior Anthony Petty said giving students' names to recruiters 
    helps the country. Also, &quot;I think it's good that they're getting troubled 
    teens, if nothing else, to explore the world,&quot; Petty said. Still, Petty 
    said recruiters don't always give a complete picture of military service. 
    &quot;I don't think it's like they're lying to people, but they're not necessarily 
    being up front with them.&quot; </p>

    ARMY RESERVE BATTLING AN EXODUS<br>
    By Robert Schlesinger <br>
    The Boston Globe<br>
    11-24-03</p>
  <p>WASHINGTON -- The US Army Reserve fell short of its reenlistment goals this 
    fiscal year, underscoring Pentagon fears that the protracted conflict in Iraq 
    could cause a crippling exodus from the armed services. The Army Reserve has 
    missed its retention goal by 6.7 percent, the second shortfall since fiscal 
    1997. It was largely the result of a larger than expected exodus of career 
    reservists, a loss of valuable skills because such staff members are responsible 
    for training junior officers and operating complex weapons systems. <br>
  </p>
  <p>&quot;The Army has invested an enormous amount of money in training these 
    people, and they're very hard to replace,&quot; said John Pike of globalsecurity.org, 
    an independent research group in Washington. With extended deployments and 
    increasingly deadly attacks by Iraqi guerrillas, Defense Department officials 
    are scrambling to combat a broader downturn in retention and recruitment that 
    they fear is on the horizon. The US Army, the primary service deployed in 
    Iraq, is offering reenlistment bonuses of $5,000 for soldiers serving there. 
    The Army National Guard is extending an official thank-you to members by arranging 
    services to honor returning soldiers. The Massachusetts National Guard is 
    offering rewards ranging from plaques to NASCAR tickets to members who lure 
    recruits. And throughout the branches, recruitment advertising is up and programs 
    are being launched to make the military seem more family-friendly. <br>
  </p>
  <p>The Army also is resorting to a policy called &quot;stop loss&quot; that 
    allows the Pentagon to indefinitely keep soldiers from leaving the service 
    once their time has expired. The policy, used during war, is designed to prevent 
    staffing shortfalls in key sectors. As the military ponders unpalatable measures 
    -- further Reserve or Guard call-ups, back-to-back tours of duty -- to fill 
    the global obligations, any personnel shortfalls could prove disastrous. &quot;It's 
    a slippery slope in the sense that there's kind of a snowball effect,&quot; 
    said Andrew F. Krepinevich, executive director of the Center for Strategic 
    and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington think tank that focuses on defense 
    issues. &quot;It's very difficult to work your way out of, very difficult 
    to put Humpty Dumpty back together again once you break the force.&quot; </p>
  <p>While Pentagon officials have insisted that recruiting and retention figures 
    are mostly at or above expected levels, thanks in part to a soft economy that 
    offers little competition, signs of trouble are emerging. Recruiting for the 
    Massachusetts National Guard, a backup to the professional Army and Air Force, 
    was down 30 percent this year. Nationwide, the Army National Guard has fallen 
    13 percent short of its recruiting goal, although that deficit was offset 
    by fewer than expected troops leaving the service. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Perhaps the most troubling statistic is the drop in retention for the Army 
    Reserve, first disclosed by Army Chief of Staff General Peter Schoomaker on 
    Wednesday in testimony before Congress. The drop was due to the Reserve falling 
    9.3 percent short of its retention goal among career soldiers. &quot;They've 
    got a fair amount of experience with these things and generally manage to 
    fine-tune them so that they pretty much have in place all of the various incentives 
    and bonuses ... that they'll pretty much come in on their number. So if they 
    were off by 6 percent, that's significant,&quot; Pike said. <br>
  </p>
  <p>It was the second time in the past seven years that the Reserve has fallen 
    below its intended reenlistment figure, according to Steve Stromvall, an Army 
    Reserve spokesman. In the 12 months that concluded at the end of September 
    2001, the Reserves was 1 percent short of its number. That the shortfall was 
    entirely among career soldiers is important because they are considered the 
    Army's backbone. &quot;They're critically important,&quot; said Cindy Williams, 
    a specialist on military personnel issues with MIT's Security Studies Program. 
    &quot;That's where the leadership is going to come from in the next decade.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>They are people like Staff Sergeant Scott Durst, a 15-year veteran of the 
    Army Reserve who extended his enlistment after a tour in Bosnia but will not 
    sign on for another tour after Iraq, though it will means he loses the opportunity 
    for retirement benefits. &quot;Not even a chance, no,&quot; said his wife 
    Nancy Durst, a high school art teacher. &quot;He didn't sign up to be a Reserve 
    to be doing active-duty orders every year.&quot; She added that her husband, 
    a member of the 94th Military Police Company, has spent too much time away 
    from their home in southern Maine and their two teenage daughters. </p>
  <p>&quot;I fear there will be a negative impact on retention of these Guard 
    and Reserve personnel,&quot; said Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine 
    who sits on the personnel subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
    &quot;There's an old saying in the Army that they enlist the soldier but reenlist 
    the family, and the new one-year 'boots on the ground' policy for service 
    in Iraq has really upset a lot of the families with whom I've talked.&quot; 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>According to internal Pentagon surveys conducted last spring and summer, 
    the overall percentage of troops intending to reenlist remained steady from 
    last year, at 58 percent. But among those serving in Iraq, only 54 percent 
    who were surveyed agreed, while 46 percent said they did not want to reenlist. 
    Michael O'Hanlon, a defense specialist at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, 
    called the figures &quot;at the threshold of tolerable. In and of themselves 
    they're not catastrophic, but the problem is they could get worse because 
    as people increasingly confirm the reality of returning to Iraq another time 
    these numbers can be expected to drop further. If you wait too long to address 
    the trends, then it's too late.&quot; </p>
  <p>In 2003, the Army's retention goal was 67 percent. Like the recruiting shortfall 
    in the Guard, the unexpected drop in the Reserve's 2003 retention was offset 
    by stronger than expected recruiting. The Army, which oversees the bulk of 
    troops in Iraq, is not the only branch of the armed services facing hardships 
    in recruitment and retention because of the Iraq war. Air Force Major Joe 
    Allegretti, chief of the Defense Department's Joint Recruiting Advertising 
    Program, cited a poll of youths conducted from April through June in which 
    half said the war in Iraq made them less likely to join the military, and 
    only one-third said it made them more likely to join. Sergeant Major James 
    Vales, senior Army counselor in charge of overseeing active-duty retention 
    policy, said his shop of 740 career counselors has been answering concerns 
    from members of Congress and Army leaders about trying to prevent a talent 
    drain. &quot;We have some things in the works to kind of offset any problems 
    that we may see in retention,&quot; Vales said, citing options ranging from 
    family-friendly policies like support groups and child care to his most important 
    tool: cash. &quot;Most of [the effort] is increasing our retention bonus dollars... 
    The biggest thing soldiers respond to is monetary incentives.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p>Reserve and Guard leaders are working to improve relations with stateside 
    families by setting up support networks, including &quot;marriage enhancement 
    seminars&quot; run through the Army Reserve's chaplaincy and designed to address 
    such issues as long separations during deployments. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Guard leaders also have sent teams into Iraq to work on the problem. Several 
    soldiers spread between Iraq and Kuwait try to act as trouble-shooters for 
    unhappy Guard members, checking back twice weekly with Guard headquarters 
    in the United States, said Colonel Frank Grass, the Guard's chief of operations. 
    <b>And thanks to &quot;stop loss,&quot; members of the Guard and Reserve cannot 
    leave the military until 90 days after they have been deactivated.</b> <br>

  A Post-Election 2004 Military Draft?<b> </b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The question of whether the U.S. government will reinstate the military draft 
    was one of the topics of conversation on CNN's &quot;In the Money&quot; program 
    on Nov. 8. The guest was David Lindorff, a regular contributor to CounterPunch 
    and a correspondent for Salon.com. Lindorff recently wrote a piece for Salon 
    entitled Oiling up the draft machine? in which he reports that the Pentagon 
    is quietly moving to fill draft board vacancies nationwide. Here's some of 
    what Lindorff had to say on the issue during the CNN program. I've paraphrased 
    the questions, but Lindorff's answers are verbatim. &#150; Mark Hand</p>
  <p><b>Q: How close is this draft idea to becoming a reality?</b></p>
  <p>Lindorff: I think what we&#146;re seeing here with the call-up of the reserves 
    and marines to go back into Iraq is being presented as kind of a desperate 
    move now in the Times today because they simply don&#146;t have the bodies 
    to go in there next year.</p>
  <p><b>Q: Who in Congress or Washington would ever support such an idea?</b></p>
  <p>Lindorff: I can&#146;t see them doing it in an election year. I think that 
    the work they&#146;re doing now is really because if they need it they&#146;ll 
    have to be able to move to it quickly after the election. You basically could 
    see a situation come November &#150; if they keep tamping down the numbers 
    for now as long as they can during a campaign &#150; to suddenly needing to 
    get those troops in there if things are turning worse. So they have to a have 
    the machinery ready. It takes six months to go from the actual start of a 
    call-up to getting the first guys delivered to boot camp.</p>
  <p><b>Q: What about the argument that the draft would not supply qualified people 
    to operate in today&#146;s military?</b></p>
  <p>Lindorff: I think what we&#146;re finding out is that&#146;s a myth. The 
    new McNamara is Rumsfeld who&#146;s been pushing this idea of the super high-tech 
    army with very few actual people on the ground. And we&#146;re finding out 
    that that doesn&#146;t work. Take a look at the helicopter shoot down. That 
    tragic event occurred because a basic rule of helicopter landing sites was 
    ignored. And that is that you secure the area because helicopters are so vulnerable 
    going up and down. That site was not secure because they did not have the 
    personnel on the ground to simply secure the perimeter. And the other thing 
    is that we&#146;re talking now about a low-intensity conflict, an occupation, 
    which requires bodies.<b> If you don&#146;t have the bodies to do the occupation 
    through selective use of force, you have to use overwhelming force, and then 
    you end up killing lots of civilians and angering more people, and that&#146;s 
    what we&#146;re doing now.</b></p>

<p align="center">Military Draft Could Include Women, Pacifists <br>
  Michael Betsch, CNSNews.com<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. Selective Service System is ready to reinstate the draft if ordered 
    by Congress and President Bush. <br>
    But in this unconventional war against terrorism, pacifists and women may 
    be surprised to learn of their potential to be called to the service by Uncle 
    Sam. During a recent regional Selective Service conference, one item discussed 
    was the inclusion of health care professionals in a wartime draft, noted Region 
    II Director Col. Keith Scraggs. According to Scraggs, a health-care draft 
    &quot;could be a likely scenario if we have a shortage of medical folks and 
    this thing drags on out.&quot; That scenario would occur only in the event 
    that &quot;the active forces, the reserves and guard couldn't handle it,&quot; 
    he added. </p>
  <p>A health-care draft is not a new concept to the U.S. military, said SSS Director 
    of Public and Congressional Affairs Lew Brodsky. &quot;There used to be a 
    doctors' draft in this country from 1950 to 1973, but it was limited to a 
    handful of doctors only and specific kinds of doctors before you had the kind 
    of specialties that we have today,&quot; said Brodsky. </p>
  <p>The issue of a health-care draft was also raised and discussed by members 
    of Congress in the late 1980s. Brodsky said the Senate Armed Services Committee 
    was concerned about the possibility of a military conflict that involved weapons 
    of mass destruction and incurred heavy casualties. </p>
  <p>Brodsky said Congress argued that in a modern war the &quot;military medical 
    capability might not be sufficient to handle that crisis. It might be understaffed 
    and might need more people quickly. &quot;Looking at the numbers of medical 
    personnel required, the time frames and the kinds of skills required &#150; 
    it would have to include women,&quot; said Brodsky. </p>
  <p>While noting that women historically have never participated in a U.S. military 
    draft lottery, Brodsky said that in today's war, &quot;it's frankly doubtful 
    that we could achieve the numbers required&quot; if female health workers 
    were not drafted. More than half of those graduating from medical schools 
    today are women, Brodsky remarked. &quot;If you're talking nurses, you've 
    got 90 percent-plus nurses in this country are women.&quot; &quot;We're not 
    registering any of those folks,&quot; Scraggs said. &quot;It's on the shelf, 
    ready to go in case we need it.&quot; </p>
  <p>However, Bill Galvin, a counseling coordinator at the anti-war Center on 
    Conscience and War, wants to ensure that all plans to activate a military 
    or health-care draft remain 'on the shelf.' &quot;The draft presents a problem 
    of crisis, especially for conscientious objectors,&quot; said Galvin. Part 
    of that crisis stems from the mandatory Selective Service registration requirement 
    for all American men between ages 18 and 26. Galvin believes the registration 
    requirement serves solely as a vehicle to enlist &quot;support for military 
    policies.&quot; </p>
  <p>Brodsky disagrees. &quot;Our answer to that is registration is not military 
    and there's really no basis for being a conscientious objector to Selective 
    Service registration.&quot; Galvin's opposition to Selective Service registration 
    requirement doesn't stop with the military; it extends to Department of Motor 
    Vehicles locations nationwide. &quot;There's an increasing number of states 
    now that are linking draft registration to obtaining a driver's license,&quot; 
    Galvin said. &quot;There are states where, if you haven't registered, you 
    can't get a license or you can't renew your license. </p>
  <p>&quot;And if they don't register by the time they turn 26,&quot; Galvin noted, 
    then they are &quot;permanently barred from all federal financial aid, most 
    federal jobs and job training.&quot; But, Brodsky maintains the Selective 
    Service System is not on a mission to draft conscientious objectors and place 
    them in the line of fire. &quot;We exist as much to serve the conscientious 
    objector community as we do the military community.&quot; In fact, those deemed 
    to be conscientious objectors by a draft board of their peers &quot;are subject 
    to assignment to civilian service in the community,&quot; Brodsky said. &quot;It 
    could be with a public-spirited hospital, an old age home, or working in AmeriCorps, 
    working on the farms for the public good, whatever.&quot; </p>
  <p>Although Galvin would prefer the dissolution of the Selective Service and 
    its registration requirement, he realizes that is not likely to occur, especially 
    during wartime. As such, Galvin acknowledged that his pacifist organization 
    and its volunteers &quot;encourage people to actually write up the answers 
    to [conscientious objector] questions now and try to gather something to support 
    it, and get this thing on file with the church.&quot; </p>
  <p>But it's not that simple to get a draft exemption, Brodsky said. &quot;Conscientious 
    objection is not self-determined. A man is not a conscientious objector because 
    he says he is; he's a conscientious objector because he proves he is, or at 
    least shows compelling evidence to a board of his community peers. &quot;If 
    everybody had the ability to declare themselves conscientious objectors, it 
    would be kind of like anarchy in a draft,&quot; said Brodsky. Copyright CNSNews.com

<p align="center">BRING BACK THE DRAFT</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center">Republican Senator Nebraska's Chuck Hagel Says 'All Of Our 
    Citizens' Should 'Pay Some Price'For US Iraqi Operation</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">WorldNetDaily.com<br>
  4-21-04</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    A Republican U.S. senator is calling for a return of the military draft so 
    the cost of the Iraq operation could be borne by people of all economic strata. 
    Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on post-occupation 
    Iraq, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said, &quot;There's not an American ... that 
    doesn't understand what we are engaged in today and what the prospects are 
    for the future.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p>Hagel, a member of the committee, says all Americans should be involved in 
    the effort. &quot;Why shouldn't we ask all of our citizens to bear some responsibility 
    and pay some price?&quot; Hagel said, arguing that restoring the draft would 
    force &quot;our citizens to understand the intensity and depth of challenges 
    we face.&quot; The senator also argued re-instituting the draft, which ended 
    in the early '70s, would cause the burden of military service to be spread 
    among all economic classes of people. </p>
  <p>&quot;Those who are serving today and dying today are the middle class And 
    lower middle class,&quot; he claimed. <br>
    Hagel's call comes just days after the Pentagon moved to extend the missions 
    of some 20,000 of the 135,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, noted a report from Agence 
    France-Presse. The Bush administration has been criticized for not using enough 
    troops as the coalition works to keep order in Iraqi cities. </p>
  <p>As WorldNetDaily reported, a pair of bills was introduced in Congress last 
    year that would bring back the military draft. <br>
    S. 89, the Senate version of the legislation, indicates its purpose is &quot;to 
    provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons in the 
    United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a 
    period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland 
    security, and for other purposes.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p>The bill was introduced Jan. 7, 2003, by Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C. Says 
    the text of the bill: &quot;It is the obligation of every citizen of the United 
    States, and every other person residing in the United States who is between 
    the ages of 18 and 26 to perform a period of national service as prescribed 
    in this Act unless exempted under the provisions of this Act.&quot; This service, 
    which would be for a minimum of two years, can be either in the military or 
    &quot;in a civilian capacity that, as determined by the president, promotes 
    the national defense, including national or community service and homeland 
    security.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p>Under the bill, &quot;conscientious objectors&quot; may request a deferment 
    from military training, but must still provide service &quot;that does not 
    include any combatant training component.&quot; Alternatively, the objector 
    can be transferred to a civilian service job. The House of Representatives 
    version of the bill, H.R. 163, is sponsored by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
    <br>
    The bill differs from an earlier attempt to re-institute the draft. As WorldNetDaily 
    reported, the &quot;Universal Military Training and Service Act,&quot; introduced 
    in December 2001, applied only to men and only those from 18-22 years of age. 
    Also, the earlier bill required just six months of service. Libertarian presidential 
    candidate Aaron Russo has launched a petition drive against the draft. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Last fall, media reported on the fact the Selective Service System had posted 
    a notice saying the agency was looking for people to serve on local draft 
    boards. Since then, the appeal has been changed to assure the public that 
    &quot;there is NO connection between this ongoing, routine public outreach 
    to compensate for natural board attrition and current international events. 
    Both the president and the secretary of defense have stated on several occasions 
    that a draft is not needed for the war on terrorism, including Iraq.&quot; 
    Libertarian commentators claim the government is getting things prepared so 
    if the draft is re-instated, conscription can begin as quickly as possible. 
    Recently, presidential candidate Ralph Nader also has warned about attempts 
    to bring back the draft. <br>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wars have long echoes. It is said that the greatest sin towards our fellow 
    man is not to hate but indifference, and that man's inhumanity to man makes 
    countless thousands mourn. The echoes of past wars live under bridges, in 
    abandoned cars and in city parks. The children of those born to veterans drenched 
    with Agent Orange, or the genetic damage, due to numerous vaccinations, pills, 
    and exposure to depleted uranium (it cuts through metal like butter), and 
    massive amounts of pollution, are the Littlest Echoes. You won't hear their 
    laughter or expressions of awe catching fireflies in the night, nor the sound 
    of little feet following daddy around the house, wanting just one more story, 
    or that special tossel to the head and hug, that only daddy can give as he 
    tucks his little one in bed. </p>
  <p>Indifference and man's inhumanity to man, is most exemplified in the suffering 
    of those children, no less loved, no less precious than those of foreign lands. 
    Lands thousands of miles away; under scorching desert sands, jungle villages, 
    or crowded cities. Children are the Earth's most precious resource and childhood, 
    a short span of wonderment, discovery and innocence. What depravity of man's 
    mindless-perverse genius, uses his intellect--his talents--his creativity 
    to invent diabolical weaponry that shatters, shreds, napalms, sucks the oxygen 
    from the air, or melts the flesh of other human beings and innocent children? 
    What lunatic irrationality poisons air-land-and people with radiated weaponry 
    that lays waste the land for billions of years and mutates the genes of whole 
    lands--bringing forth grotesque monsters?</p>

  <p>Yes, the people of the Earth, who reside in the real world of pain-suffering-deprivation-hunger-joblessness--decayed 
    infrastructures, Enron-Worldcom-Tyco etc., rip offs--closed clinics--rusted 
    mill towns--soup kitchens--and corporate thuggery, knew and know, the insanity 
    of a world at war. And so it was that last October saw millions upon millions, 
    upon millions, marching-singing-protesting--for sanity--for peace TO NO AVAIL. 
    INSANITY NEVER LISTENS TO THE VOICE OF REASON. Insanity bloated--gorged--and 
    satiated with the lust for power-control-dominion, are the forever lost trio 
    on the Yellow Brick road searching for a heart--a brain--and courage. Finding 
    none they invent it. </p>
  <p>They imagine themselves as wizards--gatekeepers--crusaders and warriors. 
    Proclamations are issued forth through the lap dog--salivating media stooges, 
    that the god of perpetual war is on their side. This vengeful--annihilating 
    god says, &quot;Bring 'em on....wanted dead or alive...</p>

  <p>...We are on a mission, a crusade to rid the world of terrorism through famine--torture--assassination--napalm--chemicals--mother 
    bombs--and cluster bombs. Sure some innocents will die mere collateral damage 
    that's the cost of freedom!&quot; </p>
  <p>Faceless--nameless--their echoed cries are smothered, beneath their collapsing 
    farm house walls, the market place, in desert tents. A bloodied severed hand 
    clasps a doorknob--a little dark-eyed boy--his arms severed, lies amidst the 
    shredded remains of his family, and a rag doll little girl is lifted gently 
    from the debris, by her &quot;liberated&quot; grandfather her feet gone---her 
    little hand hangs lifeless in this extravaganza of bombs bursting in air of 
    &quot;Shock and Shame&quot;. And the gatekeepers--the crusaders--wizards-- 
    our costumed warrior, with his testicles strapped in flight suited pride declared 
    a victory. One can picture them, far from the stench of charcoal burning bodies 
    and shredded flesh, climatically gleeful in their ornate war rooms slurping 
    down the best of scotch in celebratory madness. </p>
  <p>The cannon fodder sent off in a flurry of flags--patriotic fervor--and marching 
    bands? These youngsters, a few months removed from skateboarding, roaming 
    the malls, gathering at night with their friends in parking lots, ghetto tenements, 
    decaying mill towns, rural villages, and small town U.S.A., believed a man 
    in a glitzy recruiting bus promising them the education that their unemployed 
    miner or farmer dads could never afford. They joined in the hopes of a better 
    future, a way out of their dead end no jobs to be had lives. Others bought 
    the freedom--democracy--save us from the terrorists. The bus never showed 
    pictures of the dead, blind and maimed. It never showed the Littlest Echoes 
    born with flipper arms--missing legs. </p>
  <p>Reservists, some in their fifties, mostly joined the reserves to supplement 
    their incomes. The poor always fight rich men's wars, and return forgotten--misused--begging 
    for medical care and forever changed by the impossible the unspeakable. The 
    millions upon millions, young--old--teacher--veterans--housewives--students--grandmothers--musicians--poets--artists--etc., 
    who marched last October to stop a slaughter were labeled extremists and unpatriotic. 
    The perverseness of our times has the impressionable--the uneducated--the 
    stupid--the ignorant--the unthinking--the easily led, believing a lie. Most, 
    are so mind-numbed, that they believe that Saddam was responsible for the 
    Towers Disaster! </p>
  <p>Most know nothing of the history of the region, nor their people, and don't 
    care to know. Afghanistan, now back in the hands of the drug lords, is not 
    even spoken of. The horror and devastation there, has a land poisoned with 
    depleted uranium, with its infrastructure totally destroyed. There aren't 
    enough billions in the whole of the world to keep up with this annihilating 
    god on his mission to wipe terrorism from the earth. Catching the fog in one's 
    hands would be an easier feat than something as obscure and ludicrous as this. 
    <br>
    And now another October and millions more will march--sing--drum--and try 
    to reason with costumed--leering clowns gone mad, rampaging down the Earth's 
    midway. Thousands that were alive this time last year are now dead. Thousands 
    more are limbless-blind-mindless--or forever genetically mutated, by inhaled 
    particles of radiated uranium....with whispered echoes yet to be born, deformed 
    in numerous ways. They will not be marching. It is up to those of heart-conscience-and 
    sanity to carry their voice to the world. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Our Littlest Echo, sits pensive and wounded before us. He speaks loudly this 
    little boy lost, of the carnage-the barbaric savagery of war. His little face 
    needs to be taken to Washington and held before the world. He is everybody's 
    child--he is the loudest voice--the most articulate of speeches--the most 
    thoughtful of banners, of what we have become. The men in black helmeted uniforms 
    with their clubs and shields need to unmask and see what the people cry peace 
    for. This babe is the son of their loins--their future. They need to throw 
    their helmets and clubs aside and join the world in its cry for survival for 
    that's what it has come to. <br>
  </p>
  <p>And the Littlest Echo, and all whom he represents; be they a U.S. Soldier's 
    son--an Afghanistan child or an Iraqi youngster----what have they to say if 
    they could? &quot;I am the lie that you believed. My stunted arms represent 
    a world grown callous and cold, unable to lift the suffering-the helpless-the 
    lonely--the dispossessed--the sick and the stranger from a world gone mad 
    in its selfish egotistical pride that sees only to its own desires--lusts--and 
    conquests. My stunted legs represent a world unable, through deformity, to 
    run to the aid of another, to take a stand, to become involved locally-domestically 
    or globally with others in bettering their communities and nations. My eyes 
    see beyond your petty jealousies, your unforgiveness-one to another, your 
    drunkenness, your abuses, your bias, prejudice, hate, anger, greed, ego, and 
    arrogant self righteousness. You look upon me with pity--you need not. For 
    I am just like you only inside out. If for a brief moment in time the deformities 
    of your own natures--your spiritual void, your lewd lusts, your indifference 
    and murder of the innocents; through war or domination, could be made manifest, 
    it is you who would be the one to be pitied and I most whole. I am a world 
    without song--without laughter--without joyful dance. Make me whole, make 
    us whole. Go and speak where I cannot. You must persist, you are about Truth-Love-and 
    Peace. You are about the saving of the whole of the Earth, believe me you 
    are. This is the real mission, and you will win, for where there is great 
    evil--love abounds even more. Tell them, shout it, sing it, we will have Peace, 
    we will not be silenced.&quot; <br>

<p align="center">ANTI-DRAFT ADVISORY ON BALLOT<br>
  <br>
  By ANNE AURAND<br>
  Anchorage Daily News</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(Published: January 6, 2004)<br>
    <br>
    Voters in April can consider whether Anchorage men should be excused from 
    registering for the federal military draft. Scott Kohlhaas, Alaska Libertarian 
    Party chairman, and supporters collected enough petition signatures to get 
    the question on the April 6 ballot. Petitioners got about 10,000 signatures; 
    the minimum necessary was 6,352.</p>
  <p>Virtually all American males between 18 and 25 must sign up for Selective 
    Service. The ballot initiative, if approved, would create a task force &quot;to 
    study the effects of&quot; making Anchorage exempt. The study would consider 
    national security, government funding and other issues related to draft registration, 
    Kohlhaas said.</p>
  <p>The volunteer, appointed task force -- likely composed of military, government 
    and citizen representatives, Kohlhaas said -- would report on its findings 
    and conclusions and would figure out how to invoke a local exemption. Anchorage's 
    mayor would write a letter to the Selective Service saying that Anchorage 
    residents disapprove of registration requirements.</p>
  <p>Such exemptions haven't happened anywhere else, but Kohlhaas hopes a local 
    anti-draft message will start in Anchorage and spread. The Libertarians hope 
    Anchorage's election will kick off a national anti-draft movement. &quot;It's 
    going to make us stronger in terms of an anti-draft movement,&quot; he said. 
    &quot;People against it are organizing. That's important.&quot; </p>
  <p>Kohlhaas said Libertarians are planning a similar statewide ballot initiative 
    for 2006. He said registration wastes money, considering the draft hasn't 
    been used in 30 years. &quot;This is not anti-military at all. This is about 
    the draft,&quot; he said. &quot;We're encouraging the all-volunteer force.&quot;</p>
  <p>A city attorney approved the language that will appear on the ballot. But, 
    Mayor Mark Begich said, local laws allow almost anything on the ballot so 
    long as it's an advisory; approving the initiative wouldn't change any laws. 
    The mayor said Kohlhaas really should be petitioning the congressional delegation 
    since registration is a federal law. &quot;It doesn't make any sense,&quot; 
    Begich said. &quot;I'm not sure what the purpose is here.&quot;</p>
  <p>Begich said he would not support using any city funds to help pay for the 
    local study. If the initiative is approved, &quot;we'd just forward election 
    results over to the Selective Service. I'll pay for the stamp.&quot;</p>

  <p>U.S. Military<br>
    Pending Draft Legislation Targeted for Spring 2005<br>
    By Action Alert<br>
    May 27, 2004, </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Draft will Start in June 2005</p>
  <p>There is pending legislation in the House and Senate (twin bills: S 89 and 
    HR 163) which will time the program's initiation so the draft can begin at 
    early as Spring 2005 -- just after the 2004 presidential election. The administration 
    is quietly trying to get these bills passed now, while the public's attention 
    is on the elections, so our action on this is needed immediately.</p>
  <p>$28 million has been added to the 2004 Selective Service System (SSS) budget 
    to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as June 15, 2005. 
    Selective Service must report to Bush on March 31, 2005 that the system, which 
    has lain dormant for decades, is ready for activation. Please see website: 
    www.sss.gov/perfplan_fy2004.html to view the sss annual performance plan - 
    fiscal year 2004. </p>
  <p>The pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to fill all 10,350 draft 
    board positions and 11,070 appeals board slots nationwide.. Though this is 
    an unpopular election year topic, military experts and influential members 
    of congress are suggesting that if Rumsfeld's prediction of a &quot;long, 
    hard slog&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan [and a permanent state of war on &quot;terrorism&quot;] 
    proves accurate, the U.S. may have no choice but to draft. </p>
  <p>Congress brought twin bills, S. 89 and HR 163 forward this year, http://www.hslda.org/legislation/na...s89/default.asp 
    entitled the Universal National Service Act of 2003, &quot;to provide for 
    the common defense by requiring that all young persons [age 18--26] in the 
    United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a 
    period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland 
    security, and for other purposes.&quot; These active bills currently sit in 
    the committee on armed services. </p>
  <p>Dodging the draft will be more difficult than those from the Vietnam era. 
    College and Canada will not be options. In December 2001, Canada and the U.S. 
    signed a &quot;smart border declaration,&quot; which could be used to keep 
    would-be draft dodgers in. Signed by Canada's minister of foreign affairs, 
    John Manley, and U.S. Homeland Security director, Tom Ridge, the declaration 
    involves a 30-point plan which implements, among other things, a &quot;pre-clearance 
    agreement&quot; of people entering and departing each country. Reforms aimed 
    at making the draft more equitable along gender and class lines also eliminates 
    higher education as a shelter. Underclassmen would only be able to postpone 
    service until the end of their current semester. Seniors would have until 
    the end of the academic year. </p>
  <p>Even those voters who currently support US actions abroad may still object 
    to this move, knowing their own children or grandchildren will not have a 
    say about whether to fight. Not that it should make a difference, but this 
    plan, among other things, eliminates higher education as a shelter and includes 
    women in the draft. </p>

<p align="center">Americans Could Be Pressed Into Mandatory Community Service</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>News With Views | June 30 2004</p>
  <p>The Universal National Service Act of 2003 sitting in this 108th Congress 
    isn't getting much attention in the media, but has many Americans very concerned 
    about what it will mean if signed into law by President Bush. In the Senate, 
    S89 (Senate Bill), sponsored by Ernest Hollings, (D-SC) reads (search): To 
    provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons in the 
    United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a 
    period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland 
    security, and for other purposes. </p>
  <p>The House of Representatives has a 'sister' bill, HR 163 (House Resolution), 
    sponsored by Charlie Rangel, (D-NY) (search) which contains the same language. 
    Both bills will make it mandatory for women to serve in the military as well 
    as men; the age window for induction is 18-26. </p>
  <p>This legislation has angered many Americans for a number of reasons. Milly 
    Sundquist of Houston Texas is spitting mad. &quot;How dare this government 
    continue with further attempts to destroy the family unit by pressing women 
    into mandatory military service! My daughter will turn 23 next year and is 
    engaged to be married. She's extremely upset that this government could force 
    her into the military and send her to someplace like the Middle East to be 
    raped or beheaded by people who care nothing for human life or dignity.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>Jim Williams, a dairy farmer in the mid-West has two sons, one currently 
    serving in the Air Force. The youngest, now 21, is an integral part of the 
    family farm operation. While Williams maintains his youngest son would be 
    the first to sign up to protect America if attacked, such as was the case 
    with Pearl Harbor, this proposed legislation is dangerous to liberty. He resents 
    the federal government thinking they can just snatch his son off the farm 
    and press him into some sort of &quot;Nazi brown shirt&quot; community service 
    for homeland security. </p>
  <p>Lauren Beecham, a paralegal studying for her law degree in NY, majored in 
    world history and says Americans don't fully appreciate the danger behind 
    this type of legislation. &quot;This government thinks they can press free 
    citizens into involuntary servitude for 20-30 hours per week in support of 
    security for the Motherland. Americans don't understand how clever the communists 
    are in their quest for global domination because they don't study history. 
    Community service - especially forced community service- is rooted in communist 
    doctrine.&quot; Ms. Beecham went on to state that this legislation would not 
    withstand a Thirteenth Amendment challenge to the U.S. Constitution. </p>
  <p>Section 1 in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution states: Neither 
    slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof 
    the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, 
    or any place subject to their jurisdiction.</p>

  ARMY TO CALL UP RECRUITS EARLIER<br>
  By Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    WASHINGTON, July 21 - In what critics say is another sign of increasing stress 
    on the military, the Army has been forced to bring more new recruits immediately 
    into the ranks to meet recruiting goals for 2004, instead of allowing them 
    to defer entry until the next accounting year, which starts in October. As 
    a result, recruiters will enter the new year without the usual cushion of 
    incoming soldiers, making it that much harder to make their quotas for 2005. 
    Instead of knowing the names of nearly half the coming year's expected arrivals 
    in October, as the Army did last year, or even the names of around one in 
    three, as is the normal goal, this October the recruiting command will have 
    identified only about one of five of the boot camp class of 2005 in advance.</p>
  <p>Army officials say that they have been unable to defer as many enlistments 
    as in the past because 4,500 more recruits were needed at midyear to help 
    meet a temporary increase of 30,000 soldiers in the active duty force, which 
    is to grow to 512,000 by 2006. The increases are largely driven by the missions 
    in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
  <p>In an interview on Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Franklin L. Hagenbeck, the Army's 
    top personnel officer, said that the Army would use incentives like cash bonuses, 
    educational benefits and choice base assignments to help meet its overall 
    recruiting and re-enlistment goals next year, as it has in almost every year 
    when it started with so few advance recruits. But he acknowledged that factors 
    including the American casualties in Iraq and the improving job market made 
    filling the ranks a challenge. &quot;I worry about this every single day - 
    recruiting and retention,&quot; said General Hagenbeck, who commanded forces 
    in Afghanistan in his previous assignment. &quot;We are recruiting a volunteer 
    force during a time of war. We've never done that before.&quot; He also described 
    plans to bring on as many as 1,000 new recruiters before the end of the year, 
    and said the Army was looking to expand the role of private civilian contractors. 
  </p>
  <p>Still, some critics on Capitol Hill and among Army recruiters say that tapping 
    into the bank of recruits is a telling sign that the Army is having problems 
    filling its ranks to meet the deployments of more than 120,000 soldiers to 
    Iraq and Afghanistan. In recent weeks, the Army has said it will recruit thousands 
    of sailors and airmen who are otherwise scheduled to leave the Navy and Air 
    Force because of cutbacks. Starting this month, the Army may delay the retirements 
    of soldiers with at least 20 years' experience if they are in jobs that face 
    critical staffing shortages. The Army's top training forces at Fort Polk, 
    La., and Fort Irwin, Calif., are being deployed for the first time, to Iraq, 
    raising concerns among some officers that troops will not be given the most 
    strenuous preparation possible before they leave the United States. </p>
  <p>&quot;The Army is stretched dangerously thin,&quot; Representative Ike Skelton 
    of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told 
    Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, in a hearing on Wednesday. 
    &quot;We are growing the Army as fast as we can,&quot; General Schoomaker 
    said later in the hearing. </p>
  <p>In interviews with recruiting officials, as well as in internal memos and 
    e-mail messages obtained by The New York Times, this pressure to meet recruiting 
    goals is evident. &quot;Guys the mission is at risk!&quot; Col. Peter M. Vangjel, 
    a deputy commander of the Army Recruiting Command, wrote to battalion commanders 
    and top enlisted soldiers in an April 21 e-mail message. &quot;We can NOT 
    miss this mission. I need your full support.&quot; Colonel Vangjel continued, 
    &quot;The CG is the next guy to talk to you about this,&quot; referring to 
    the commanding general of the recruiting command, Maj. Gen. Michael D. Rochelle. 
    &quot;Don't let it happen.&quot; But in a June 23 memo to the same senior 
    recruiters, Colonel Vangjel expressed disappointment, saying that in the previous 
    several months, the command &quot;experienced a downward production trend.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>Army officials disclosed Wednesday that none of the Army's five recruiting 
    brigades met their missions between March and July, forcing the service to 
    tap into its bank of recruits to make up the difference. General Hagenbeck 
    said that Army recruiting was shaped by a number of intangibles, most notably 
    the economy, which attracts possible recruits into the private sector when 
    it is strong and sends them toward the military during a downturn. </p>
  <p>GENERAL HAGENBECK ALSO DESCRIBED TEH CRITICAL ROLE PLAYED BY PARENTS, TEACERS 
    AND COACHES AS TO WHETHER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES CONSIDER ARMY SERVICE - RECRUITERS 
    CALL THEM &quot;INFLUENCERS.&quot; Fears that these influencers would no longer 
    endorse Army service were raised in April, he said, when the military's public 
    standing sustained severe blows. An Army survey conducted as the nation was 
    rocked by pictures of military police abusing and humiliating Iraqi detainees 
    at Abu Ghraib prison - which coincided with a spike in combat deaths - raised 
    concerns that the &quot;influencers were drawing back,&quot; he said. A month 
    later, though, those negative perceptions had diminished, the Army found, 
    and there is no solid evidence that recruiting will be affected over time, 
    the general said. </p>
  <p>Once soldiers initially enlist, they usually wait one month to one year before 
    they formally enlist and are shipped to basic training. As of June 30, there 
    were 2,260 recruits in the delayed entry program, down from 12,236 recruits 
    a year ago. By dipping into this personnel bank, some recruiting officials 
    said, the Army is eating its seed corn. &quot;They are stealing from the future 
    to accomplish their current accession mission,&quot; said one Army recruiting 
    official, referring to the enlisted recruits sent to basic training. </p>
  <p>Some congressional officials said, though, that the Army was making a smart 
    move. &quot;But they must be prepared to put additional manpower and funding 
    against recruiting to achieve the increased recruiting objectives and to restore 
    the D.E.P. at the same time,&quot; said one senior House Republican aide, 
    using the program's acronym. General Hagenbeck said the Army was doing that. 
    Before the Sept. 11 attacks, the Army had moved hundreds of recruiters into 
    other jobs, as the service was easily filling slots. In the current environment, 
    General Hagenbeck said, 100 to 200 civilian recruiters will staff recruiting 
    stations and seek out enlistees, and 650 to 1,000 soldiers will be moved into 
    recruiter slots before the year's end. </p>
  <p>General Hagenbeck said that all 10 of the Army's active-duty divisions had 
    met their re-enlistment goals, but it is coming at a steep price. The Army 
    is offering re-enlistment bonuses up to $10,000 a soldier. The retention budget 
    has nearly doubled in five years, to a request for $204 million in the proposed 
    budget for 2005. </p>
  <p>Army officials and members of Congress say that much of the data on recruiting 
    and retention trends are anecdotal, and may remain so at least through the 
    next troop rotation to Iraq, when soldiers could leave the service as they 
    emerge from a &quot;stop loss, stop move&quot; order that held them in their 
    units for the duration of their deployments. </p>
