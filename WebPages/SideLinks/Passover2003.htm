    Jews, but also Christians, as well as many others who sense the greater, universal 
    dimensions of their own faith--will gather together to observe a three-thousand-year-old 
    ritual called the <i>Pasce</i>, <i>Pasec</i>, or Passover...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Passover is not only the basis and the starting point of the 
  entire Liturgical year, which carries us Full Circle each year back to the beginning 
  of the Year again, but it marks the beginning of an even greater Circle of Time, 
  one that has carried all of us (year by year, and century by century) from one 
  end of this age to the other...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>1 Corinthians 10:1-12; Hebrews, chapter 12</b></p>
<p><font size="+1"> It has carried us across these Seven epic days, out of the 
  East and across the pages of history, to the very time and the place wherein 
  we have been commanded to observe the High Holy Days of the Seventh Month, here 
  at the Western ends of the earth. Having arrived we also understand that we 
  have come Full Circle to where it all began almost Six-thousand (or 120 Jubilees 
  of) years ago--to where the entire historical epic, and the mystery of Creation 
  itself, began to impress itself upon the mind of Adam--and upon all of those 
  who dwelt at that time near the Roots of the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden. 
  This is not only the reason why the Hebrew children were commanded to observe 
  Ten days (the number of the Sefirot on the Tree of Life) between the New Moon 
  of the Seventh month and <i>Yom Kippur</i> or the Day of Atonement (see Leviticus 
  23:27 and the subchapter entitled The Seventh Month in the Addendum to this 
  work), but why they were also commanded to <i>count the Omer</i>, or the series 
  of 49 days (and then 49 years) that proceeded from the time of Passover to <i>Shavout</i>, 
  the Festival of Weeks, or the Day of Pentecost, (Leviticus, chapters 23 and 
  25). Having counted this many years Forty times (49 X 40) (or the number of 
  years the children of Israel spent in the wilderness of the nations), the Nation-church 
  would have arrived at last at the fullest meaning the words which say: <i>And 
  when the day of Pentecost was fully come, </i> (Acts, chapter 2, KJV). They 
  would be able to open up the pages of the book of the prophet Joel and understand 
  all that is unfolding in the world around them. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And so here we are in the very midst of these days. The Great 
  Day of the Lord has arrived. The final judgments of the nations have begun (The 
  Great Dragon has been let loose again), the books are opening, and the Holy 
  Child (the next state of human consciousness) is laboring to be born. (Revelation 
  12:1,2). And in the whole of it we come to understand that Passover, and therefore 
  the story of the Exodus, is not an historical event, it is a suprahistorical 
  event. It did not <i>happen </i>as it is recorded in the Bible, it is <i>happening</i> 
  as it is recorded in the Bible:</font></p>

  ARCHAEOLOGY TOUCHES A NERVE</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Gustav Niebuhr</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 400 years, the sermon has been 
    an American art form, a spoken message for a mass audience, with references 
    to a religious text. Some had such impact they entered literary history, as 
    witness recent books of famous sermons by preachers from Cotton Mather to 
    the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But in an era in which visual culture 
    seems dominant, can a sermon still arouse in people a deep response, prompting 
    days, even weeks, of discussion? For an affirmative response, one might look 
    to Rabbi David Wolpe of Sinai Temple, a 1,600-family synagogue belonging to 
    Judaism's Conservative movement, in the Westwood district of Los Angeles.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some weeks ago, on Passover's eve, 
    he preached a sermon discussing the fact that archaeologists had not found 
    evidence in the Sinai desert to support the biblical account of the ancient 
    Israelite's Exodus from Egypt. In raising this subject, Rabbi Wolpe was hardly 
    revealing a secret about contemporary archaeology. For a decade, a growing 
    number Israeli archaeologists have been quite public about their work, which 
    has generated controversy in Israel and which includes discoveries that have 
    led to another theory, that the Israelites gradually emerged as a people from 
    the Bronze Age population of Canaan, rather than militarily conquering the 
    land, as the Bible tells.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, having archaeology discussed 
    from the pulpit, rather than from secular academia, touched a nerve. &quot;I've 
    gotten responses essentially from all over the world,&quot; Rabbi Wolpe said...The 
    sermon made news in Los Angeles and eventually in Jerusalem, as well as in 
    points in between...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/dragon.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, Rabbi Wolpe said his sermon, 
    which he followed up with other talks to his congregation, was meant to do 
    something more than use archaeology as a counterpoint to biblical narratives. 
    He wanted, he said, to say that fundamental spiritual truth can exist quite 
    apart from historical facts, and this, for Jews, can be found in what the 
    Bible tells about the Exodus.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sermon, he said, was intended 
    to present the story of Passover, and to say it should not be understood as 
    precise historical record, but appreciated instead &quot;for its deeper and 
    more central meaning,&quot; as giving Jews a way to understand the pattern 
    of their history, with liberation following enslavement.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is the sacred story 
    of our people,&quot; Rabbi Wolpe said, referring to Exodus, &quot;and I believe 
    that it has a historical kernel. But that's not the most important part of 
    it. The most important part of it is it is true--even if it is not literal, 
    even if it is not factual--it is true, and Jews for millennia have seen the 
    truth of it,&quot; the rabbi said. &quot;The truth is the way it allows us 
    to see our history and experience our present.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SEASONS OF OUR JOY</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do we accomplish by acting 
    out the cycle, using the symbols, telling the stories?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Long ago our people believed that 
    if we celebrate the cycle, the cycle was more likely to continue. The rains 
    would come when they were due, the sun would shine more warmly in its season, 
    the crops would grow--and die, and grow again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we celebrate the cycle, we believed, 
    our deliverance from slavery would come again. The spiral of history would 
    keep on circling upward </font>(or downward)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    if we lived through the spirals of our past. Someday the spiral would free 
    us--with Messiah.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there is one more reason to 
    observe the cycle: from the beginning the Jewish people have celebrated the 
    festivals in order to honor the Unity that underlies all life. The very interweaving 
    of the themes of history and nature, the human life cycle and moments of spiritual 
    experience--remind us that in some sense all the realms of Life are dancing 
    with each other. The circles of the sun, and of the moon; of a single human 
    life between the generations, and an entire people's history of renewal; of 
    every act of newness, birth, creation--all are echoes of one Circle. </font>The

  <p><font size="+1">We must also see, that while the Sun represents Christianity 
    (an historical tradition that shall now come to its own conclusions in the 
    events of our time), it is also a symbol for the Male Principle of Life. Likewise, 
    just as the Moon represents Judaism as we have come to know it, and as it 
    has come to know itself, it also represents the entire Feminine Principle 
    of Life. The one is equal to the other (Zechariah, chapter 4, KJV)...</font></p>

    who could not understand these things--for those who could not fully understand 
    the mysteries of their own religious tradition and how they would unfold in 
    the last days, and how the principles of Balance and Harmony in the Universe 
    were being tread under foot these last two-thousand years. (The powerful ruling 
    over the meek, the wealthy over the poor, and, of course, the male principle 
    over the female principle. Such realities are being brought to their conclusion 
    as well). And it is doubly sad for all of those who have arrived at this time 
    in history, still unaware of these things--still unaware of how the Divine 
    Mother and the Heavenly Father (YHVH-Elohim) are revealing Themselves in the 
    earth at this time, and how They are reconciling all things to themselves...the 
    Light to the Light, and the Darkness to destruction. It is a Birth, and both 
    a terrible and a wonderful thing to behold. (Have no fear for the innocent. 
    They are back in the bosom of the Great World Soul, or are are safe and sound

    result of the events of September 11th and the words of Isaiah that say:</font></p>

    great nation)<i><font size="+1">, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams

  <p><i><font size="+1">Moreover the light of the Moon shall be as the light of 
    the Sun, and the light of the Sun shall be Sevenfold, as the light of Seven 
    days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of His people, and healeth 
    the stroke of their wound...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah 30:25,26).</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The recital of this song was most

    like one person. With a common purpose they said &quot;ashira&quot;--&quot;I 
    will sing,&quot; in the singular--as if sung by one person. We would have 
    expected them to say &quot;nashira,&quot; we will sing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the Israelites ascended from 
    the Red Sea, they desired to sing a song. How did they render the song? An 
    infant was lying on his mother's knees and a baby was nursing at her mother's 
    breast. When they beheld the &quot;Shechina,&quot; the infant raised his head 
    and the baby ceased nursing and they exclaimed (15:2), He is my G-d and I

    the words and perform the ritual, are reliving an epoch which is peculiar 
    to Jewish history, the drama that is Passover is no longer ours alone. Its 
    enactment is not confined to the dining rooms of our homes alone; it has been 
    embraced by the world at large, and is continually being reenacted on the 
    stage of mankind by all who seek avenues to assert their condemnation of oppression 
    and tyranny, by all who labor in the vineyard of the Lord searching for freedom 
    and peace.</font></p>
