<p align="center"><b>Freud: Oedipus Without Oracle</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>The scientific study of prophetic claims has made halting but notable 
    progress with the advancement in psychology, notably in psychoanalysis. Sigmund 
    Freud, who so greatly widened man's insight into his unconscious drives, was 
    selective in his research and ideas; nowhere is this more striking than in 
    his major concept of the Oedipus complex. Named after the legendary Greek 
    King Oedipus who killed his father and married his mother...</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make 
      my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and He that putteth 
      not into their mouths, </font></i><font size="+1"><i>THEY EVEN PREPARE WAR 
      AGAINST HIM</i>.</font></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not 
      have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; 
      and the Sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over 
      them.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: 
      yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God...</font></i><font size="+1">(Micah 
      3:5-7).</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Examination of Sophocles' play <i>Oedipus Rex</i> shows that Freud accepted 
    one key idea from this ageless tragedy but ignored the significance of another. 
    He plucked the Oedipus complex from the plot and dialogue, but shunted aside 
    Sophocles' classic acceptance of oracular prophecy. Freud could have noted 
    the universal validity of Oedipus' predestined fate, while recognizing the 
    fundamental psychological implications that relate man's longing to know the 
    future, as dramatized in the play. In his <i>Interpretation of Dreams</i>, 
    Freud wrote that the play was &quot;known as a tragedy of destiny,&quot; and 
    that &quot;its tragic effect is said to lie in the contrast between the supreme 
    will of the gods and the vain attempt of mankind to escape the evil that threatens 
    them.&quot; But to him the play's impact on a modern audience, as on an ancient 
    Greek one, &quot;does not lie in the contrast between destiny and human will,&quot; 
    but in (some other dynamic)...</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><i></i></b><i><font size="+1">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed 
      a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 
      2:3).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>According to Freud, we are moved by the fate of Oedipus &quot;only because 
    it might have been ours--because the oracle laid the same curse upon us before 
    our birth as upon him.&quot; And he adds: &quot;It is the fate of all of us, 
    perhaps, to direct our first sexual impulse toward our mother and our first 
    hatred and our first murderous wish against our father. Our dreams convince 
    us that it is so.&quot; Freud added that we outgrow these emotions, unless 
    we become psychoneurotic...</b></p>
  <p><b>In summarizing the Sophocles play, Freud plays down the element of predestination 
    but emphasizes the love-of-mother and hatred-of-father themes. He does not 
    note that the oracle warned Oedipus' father, Laius, that the still unborn 
    child would murder him...</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b><i></i></b><i><font size="+1">And the Lord hath sent unto you all his 
      servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, 
      nor inclined your ear to hear...</font></i><font size="+1">(Jeremiah 25:4).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Because of the wide attention that Freud's concept of the &quot;Oedipus 
    complex&quot; has attracted in popular psychology, the implications of Sophocles' 
    sequel to the play have been largely ignored. The...philosopher-playwright 
    had his final say in <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>, completed shortly before his 
    death and performed posthumously. In it, the aged Oedipus returns to Attica...at 
    peace with himself but in rebellion against fate. As he had never known the 
    Laius and Jocasta were his natural parents, destiny had virtually tricked 
    him into his actions, and into the partial self-destruction he committed by 
    blinding himself. Oedipus, at the end of his life's journey, turns with contempt 
    on those who took advantage of his misfortune. He acts out yet another oracular 
    prophecy by going serenely to an all-forgiving death--a man purged of whatever 
    curse he may have suffered, cleansed of a guilt that was never his. In the 
    concluding scene of the play, Oedipus is freed of his &quot;complex&quot; 
    by following a predestined fate that is no longer tragic, but that of a man 
    sure of his essential purity and worth.</b></p>
  <p><b>As translated by Robert Fitzgerald, in <i>Sophocles: the Oedipus Cycle</i>, 
    (New York, 1939), Oedipus comes to terms with his own fate in this soliloquy:</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="+1">&quot;...The bloody deaths, the incest, the calamities 
      you speak of so glibly of: I suffered them, by fate against my will! </font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">It was God's pleasure, </font><font size="+1">and perhaps 
      our race had angered Him long ago.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">In me myself you could not find such evil </font><font size="+1">as 
      would have made me sin against my own.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">And tell me this: if there were prophecies repeated by 
      the oracles of the gods,</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">That Father's death should come through his own son,</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">How could you justly blame it upon me? On me who was yet 
      unborn, yet unconceived,</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Not yet existent for my father and mother?</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">If then I came into the world--as I did come--in wretchedness, 
      and met my father in fight,</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">And knocked him down, not knowing that I killed him,</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">Nor whom I killed--again, how could you find guilt in that 
      unmeditated act?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Preparing for death, Oedipus settles in the groves of the Furies...Eagerly, 
    he awaits word from the Oracle of Apollo. He welcomes his daughter Ismene, 
    reminding her that she had once before acted as messenger, &quot;Unknown to 
    Thebes, bringing me news of all The Oracle had said concerning me...&quot; 
    He questions her to find out whether the gods are &quot;concerned with my 
    deliverance.&quot; Ismene assures him, &quot;I have, father, the latest sentences 
    of the oracle.&quot; Oedipus asks, &quot;How are they worded? What do they 
    prophesy?&quot; She replies, &quot;That you shall be much solicited by our 
    people before your death--and after--for their welfare.&quot;...For the gods 
    who threw you down sustain you now...&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Clearly, these passages indicate a concern for the continuing theme of 
    oracular power, the impact of destiny on man. Freud sought out and found the 
    Oedipal tragedy in the work of Sophocles, but ignored its dramatization of 
    the psychological dynamics underlying man's search of prophetic assurance, 
    the desire to know, conquer, and possibly control a seemingly inevitable fate. 
    The Oracle's role in the Oedipus plays need be regarded as neither malevolent 
    nor benign; they may simply stand for the yearning for knowledge of good and 
    ill, beyond man's &quot;normal&quot; sensory range. The Oracle's key roles 
    in the Oedipus legend correspond to human concern with future destiny, strong 
    in man's emotions, in his daily existence as well as in his apparent premonitory 
    dreams. At times, such dreams have a multiple impact: they not only picture 
    events that seem to come true later on in defiance of orderly chronological 
    concepts, but they may also reflect emotional states that bring about the 
    events; the very strength of the dream experience may help to pave the way 
    for these events. Freud never got around to studying closely, much less accepting, 
    a number of the psychological implications of <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>, but 
    some of those who build their own ideas on the foundation of Freudian concepts, 
    have done daring and fascinating research in precognition as well as in telepathy...</b></p>
  <p><b>The wish to know the future is alive in man today, as it has been since 
    prehistoric times. It has strong, basic emotional appeal. Certainly, an issue 
    so old and fundamental cannot be cast aside by schools of psychology that 
    seek to explore, understand, diagnose, heal, and guide modern man...</b></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="+2">C. G. Jung: Searching Healer</font></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Freud's most gifted disciple and later most relentless antagonist,Carl 
    Gustav Jung, brought emotional insight to many through his analytical psychology...He 
    was deeply concerned with the meaning of psychic phenomena. This involvement 
    hastened his break with Freud. Nearly a half century later, in 1958, Jung 
    wrote:</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>&quot;It interested me to hear Freud's views on precognition 
    and on parapsychology in general. When I visited him in Vienna in 1909, I 
    asked him what he thought of these matters. Because of his materialistic prejudice, 
    he rejected the entire complex of questions as nonsensical, and did so in 
    terms of so shallow a positivism that I had difficulty in checking the sharp 
    retort on the tip of my tongue. It was some years before he recognized the 
    seriousness of parapsychology and acknowledged the faculty of 'occult' phenomena.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>In his clinical practice, Jung encountered a number of precognitive 
    cases. As he naturally dealt with these in terms of analytical psychology, 
    definitions are in order. In her book <i>An introduction to Jung's Psychology</i>, 
    Dr. Frieda Fordham defines Jung's use of &quot;collective&quot; as the psychic 
    contents which are not common to one individual but to many.&quot; Thus, when 
    these are unconscious, they are termed the &quot;collective unconscious.&quot; 
    Jung's &quot;archetype&quot; is defined as &quot;a content of the collective 
    unconscious which is the psychological counterpart of instinct,&quot; also 
    loosely used to designate a collective image or symbol...</b></p>

<p align="center"><b></b><b><img src="../../UsedImages/pg000d-Mandala.gif" width="231" height="450"></b></p>
<blockquote> <b>In one central piece of research and writing, Jung managed to 
  put, as the English say, the cat among the pigeons. This was &quot;Synchronicity: 
  An Acausal Connecting Principle,&quot; in <i>The Interpretation of Nature and 
  the Psyche</i>, a long essay that ranges across psychology, philosophy, physics, 
  parapsychology, and adjacent sciences. Its significance to prophetic experiences 
  lies with the challenge which it offers psychology and physics in the time-space 
  concept. Although Jung never suggested that a deeply felt human need will actually 
  bring about certain events, he repeatedly emphasizes the correlation between 
  emotion and event. As he puts it: &quot;Synchronicity, therefore means the simultaneous 
  occurrence of a certain psychic state with one or more external events which 
  appear as meaningful parallels to the momentary subjective state--and in certain 
  cases, vice versa.&quot; This is relevant to precognition, because Jung does 
  not then let the word &quot;simultaneous&quot; stand in the way of en event 
  happening in the future...&quot;In all cases,&quot; he states, &quot;whether 
  it is a question of spatial or of temporal ESP, we find a simultaneity of the 
  normal or ordinary state with another state or experience which is not causally 
  derivable from it, and whose objective existence can only be verified afterwards.&quot;</b>

    within the Tree of Knowledge: in the outside, the forbidden fruit, that brought 
    concealment, death, and distance from God; but growing within, the source 
    of life, unity, and revelation. Body and Soul. Adam &quot;sinned&quot; (parenthesis 
    mine) when he tasted only from the outer Tree, but had he eaten of the two

  <p align="left"><b>It is one of the deepest teachings of Judaism, understanding

    the body. God would be revealed in the world. The story of Adam in the garden

  <i>by My Name; for I have </i>created<i> him for My Glory, I have </i>formed 
  <i>him yea I have </i>made <i>him. </i>These four levels of CALLING, CREATING, 
  FORMING and MAKING recur throughout the Scriptures and throughout Kabbalah. 
  They exist within the primordial Tree of Life, in Azilut, and correspond symbolically 
  to its root, trunk, branch and fruit, or to the Four letters of the Tetragrammaton 
  or most special Name of God, YHVH. They are also perceived, for example, in 
  the familiar four elements of the lowest sefirah, Malkhut. As such they represent 
  Four levels or stages of removal from the source of All. </b> 
  <p align="left"><b>The first level, associated with Fire, is closest to the 
    Crown (Keter) and is seen as symbolic of pure WILL (the Divine Calling)</b><font size="+1"> 
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The Mind of God at last

    AIR, is symbolic of INTELLECT (the Divine Creation). The third level, associated 
    with WATER, is seen as an expression of EMOTION, in ever changing forms (the 
    Divine 'forming'). The fourth and last, associated with EARTH, speaks (of 
    the lower world) of ACTION. Each level contains the qualities and activities 
    of the one above, so that each descending level in turn is under more laws,

    it is like the will to have a house which has been conceived but not yet defined

    the germ of all these processes. Likewise these four levels inherent in Azilut 
    unfold themselves in four great stages, each a World in itself, in the following 
    way. Conceived in Azilut (Fire), Manifestation calls forth in principle (Air) 
    the cosmic process of Creation, (Beriah in Hebrew), which can be understood 
    in terms of a second complete Tree emerging from the first. From Beriah there 
    emerges a third fluid World of Formation (Yezirah), from which a fourth, solid 
    World of Action (Asiyyah) comes into existence. Each level has its own Tree, 
    each World following in its own context the exact configuration and dynamics 
    of the Tree of Azilut, and each therefore having within its reality the same

  here right into our interpretation of these Four descending Worlds as they reveal 
  themselves in the first chapter of Genesis. (Please see the chapter on Russia, 
  Esau, and holy Angels). Here we follow the Mind of God (<i>For our God is a 
  Consuming </i>FIRE) out of the heavens of human comprehension, into the fluid 
  regions of creation--the AIR above, and the WATERS below--and finally into the 
  solid regions of the EARTH, and to the eventual creation of Man. (Genesis 1:14-26).
