<p align="center"><b>Armageddon Anxiety, Evil on the Way<br>
  by WILLIAM COOK</b></p>
<p><b>Bob Woodward's deferent, perhaps even obeisant homage to &quot;Dubya&quot; 
  in his recent book, Bush at War, contains this troubling observation: &quot;The 
  President was casting his mission and that of the country in the grand vision 
  of God's Master Plan.&quot; This frightening perception followed the President's 
  declamation, &quot;We will export death and violence to the four corners of 
  the earth in defense of this great country and rid the world of evil.&quot; 
  </b></p>
<p><b>Considering how Bush Jr. grew up beneath the Reagan/Bush baldacchino and 
  then helped guide his father's ascension to the throne, his connections with 
  the Christian Right has a long and deep history, including familiarity with 
  the pseudo-prophet, Hal Lindsey, a frequent visitor to the Reagan White House.</b></p>
<p><b>Lindsey, the New York Times &quot;Best Selling Author&quot; of the past 
  three decades, author of at least 20 books like The Late Great Planet Earth, 
  and influential Father of Christian Zionism, foresees the imminent and unavoidable 
  great battle of Armageddon, the fulfillment of John's prophecy in the Book of 
  Revelation, the cataclysmic conflict between the forces of Good against the 
  forces of Evil, climaxing in our lifetime. Jesus Christ, King of the Jews, will 
  return to rule the world from the rebuilt temple in the reclaimed nation of 
  Israel according to the prophecies, and we will witness the inevitable suffering 
  and global holocaust. Lindsey proclaims deliverance from Armageddon depends 
  on understanding God's purposes for the Jews including the restoration of Israel 
  as a nation in the land of Judea and Samaria.</b></p>
<p><b>Lindsey also proclaims that he purposefully writes these books to shock 
  people into believing in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. And like any 
  good insurance salesman, he instills fear as he threatens his customers with 
  the plagues revealed in the Acts of the Apostles and the Book of Revelation: 
  &quot;... The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood....With 
  Justice he judges and makes war ... He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood 
  and his name is the word of God ... Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with 
  which to strike down nations. .so you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, 
  and mighty men, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free 
  and slave, small and great&quot; The Messiah slays the Antichrist and &quot;creates 
  a new heaven and a new earth&quot; and He judges the dead, saves the Christians, 
  and casts the rest into eternal perdition.</b></p>
<p><b>Lindsey accepts as reality that his interpretations of the prophecies come 
  directly to him from God, &quot;I believe that the Spirit of God gave me a special 
  insight, not only into how John described what he actually experienced, but 
  also into how this whole phenomenon encoded the prophecies so that they could 
  be fully understood only when their fulfillment drew near ... I prayerfully 
  sought for a confirmation for my apocalypse code theory...&quot; This self-proclaimed, 
  God inspired interpreter of the Bible has had a profound influence on American 
  and British Christians and Jews. Since Ronald Reagan's Christian based regime 
  of the '80s which included access to the President by not only Lindsey, but 
  Jerry Falwell and the Christian Zionist televangelist Mike Evans, the interests 
  of Zionism as an integral component of prophetic lure have been central in policy 
  formation toward Israel in particular and the mid-east generally in both America 
  and the United Kingdom. The current administration, even more so than Reagan's, 
  is rife with right-wing reliance on the coming revival predicted in the Book 
  of Revelation.</b></p>
<p><b>Consider observations made by Paul Krugman of the New York Times December 
  18, 2002: &quot;Tom DeLay soon to be House majority leader, told a church group 
  that: 'Only Christianity offers a way to live in response to the realities that 
  we find in this world &shy; only Christianity.' He also said he was on a mission 
  from God to promote a 'biblical worldview' in American politics.&quot; This 
  from the most powerful man in the Congress! And he is not alone. According to 
  Krugman, many leading Congressional Republicans belong to the &quot;secretive&quot; 
  Council for National Policy, an organization founded by Tim LaHaye, co-author 
  of the apocalyptic &quot;Left Behind&quot; novels. Members include Pat Robertson, 
  Ralph Reed, Sen. Jesse Helms, Congressman Dick Armey and Tom DeLay of Texas, 
  Howard Phillips, and many, many others. This fundamentalist group listens, in 
  private, to none other than the self-proclaimed &quot;Born Again&quot; Christian, 
  George W. Bush. Consider also the appointment of John Ashcroft to the position 
  of Attorney General, a vocal Christian fundamentalist who &quot;gives every 
  appearance of placing his biblical worldview above secular concerns...&quot; 
  Add to this the neo-cons in the administration like Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz, 
  Pearle, Feith, and many others, and one understands that the ties that bind 
  the neocon Christian right, read Christian Zionists, to the Zionist orthodox 
  Jew cement mentalities that embrace myths as truth and behavior directed by 
  superstitious beliefs, regardless of those who do not share their zeal.</b></p>
<p><b>I believe that the views expressed by Hal Lindsey as they are reflective 
  of beliefs held by &quot;Dominionists,&quot; including Dr. Tony Evans, founder 
  of Promise Keepers, Dr. Martin Hawkins, Assistant to Evans, James Ryle of the 
  Vineyard Movement among others, permeate the Bush administration's major figures, 
  most especially the President, guide their approach to foreign policy, and transform 
  their perception of themselves as executers of God's will. The potential destructive 
  power inherent in this mentality, that accepts as truth interpretations of mythological 
  stories or willingly uses those interpretations to exhort others to action, 
  can be understood and can be thwarted before such devastation occurs. That conclusion 
  we can draw from history should we consider the destructive power of myth as 
  it was wielded by Urban II as he inaugurated the Crusades to liberate Jerusalem, 
  Innocent III when he exterminated the Cathar sect in the 12th and 13th centuries, 
  the Puritan divines when they slaughtered the Pequot Indians in 1636-37, and 
  the elimination of the beliefs extant in northern Europe before the onslaught 
  of Christianity in the middle ages, to offer a few examples. When the elite 
  few who gain power in a country or over a group of people accept myths as truth, 
  or when they insidiously and ruthlessly use the beliefs people hold to affect 
  their ends, devastation follows. An enlightened American public can thwart the 
  myth driven elite. </b></p>
<p><b>Michael Ortiz Hill, author of Dreaming the End of the World, characterizes 
  Bush, in his essay in CounterPunch January 4, 2003, as &quot;...delusional and 
  the shape of his delusion is specifically apocalyptical in belief and intent.&quot; 
  By apocalyptical Hill means that &quot;All systems are supposed to go down so 
  the Messiah can come and Bush, seemingly, has taken on the role of the one who 
  brings this to pass.&quot; &quot;God sovereignly controls all aspects of life&quot; 
  according to this view, and that understanding is inherent in the teachings 
  of the Promise Keepers Movement and its founder, Dr. Tony Evans, and the perspective 
  of Billy Graham, two of the prominent right-wing Christians who have influenced 
  Bush. Graham is credited with Bush's rebirth in Christ and Dr. Tony Evans is 
  pastor of a large Dallas church where Bush heard a great deal about &quot;how 
  the world should be seen from a divine viewpoint&quot; according to Dr. Martin 
  Hawkins, assistant to Evans. (Hill).</b></p>
<p><b>Both the Promise Keepers and the Vineyard Movements according to Gary Gilley 
  in &quot;The Vineyard Movement&quot; accept the doctrine of &quot;end time&quot; 
  or &quot;dominionism&quot; that believes there will be a seizure of earthly 
  power by God's people (read Christians) to restore the earth to God's control. 
  Dominion theology teaches that Christ restored dominion over life to the followers 
  of Christ, but the church now has the obligation of redeeming society in order 
  to bring about the Second Coming. They also contend that the kingdom of God 
  is now and they have the responsibility to manifest God's power before the entire 
  world. Taking control of the earth must happen before Christ will return to 
  usher in the physical kingdom on earth over which He will reign.</b></p>
<p><b>But Christian Zionists also believe that, before Christ can return, the 
  Jews must return to Israel. Many evangelical Christians cite Genesis 12 and 
  13 to demonstrate that &quot;the Jews have title deed to Israel and that the 
  land must not be given back to the Palestinians,&quot; according to Thomas Williamson 
  in his article &quot;To Whom Does the Land of Palestine Belong?&quot; Christian 
  Zionists, according to Williamson, &quot;regard God's covenant with Abraham, 
  including the land grant, as an unconditional covenant.&quot; More frighteningly, 
  &quot;Every act taken by Israel is orchestrated by God, and should be condoned, 
  supported, and even praised by the rest of us,&quot; notes Grace Halsell in 
  her article &quot;Israeli Extremists and Christian Fundamentalists: The Alliance.&quot; 
  Not all Christians accept this interpretation, but for those who do, the reestablishment 
  of Israel in 1948 ushered in the conditions necessary to bring about the rapture: 
  Jewish control of Jerusalem and rebuilding the temple. Then and only then can 
  the final, great battle called Armageddon begin. Estimates vary, but Halsell 
  claims &quot;10 to 40 million Americans believe Palestine is God's chosen land 
  for the Jews&quot;(1). Maintenance of Israel as a nation becomes an obligation 
  on the part of Christian Zionists if Biblical prophecy is to be fulfilled.</b></p>
<p><b>That places George W. Bush in a unique position as a leader of the world's 
  mightiest military power: to bring about the fulfillment of God's prophecy. 
  Hill claims that Bush has accepted this eschatology through which he sees himself 
  &quot;as an agent of God who has been called by him to 'restore the earth to 
  God's control'&quot; (2). S.R. Shearer of Antipas Ministries, notes Hill, calls 
  this delusional. Hill refers to Bob Woodward's new book, Bush at War, to give 
  substance to this Messianic view of the President. Woodward observes &quot;The 
  president was casting his mission and that of the country in the grand vision 
  of God's Master Plan&quot; (2). Add to these comments the closing sentence of 
  his 2003 State of the Union Speech, &quot;The liberty we prize is not America's 
  gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity,&quot; and we can sense his 
  Messianic fervor as he leads the world against the &quot;man-made&quot; forces 
  of evil. </b></p>
<p><b>Unfortunately, the determination of that evil resides in the beliefs of 
  those interpreting the &quot;prophecies&quot; and those who accept those interpretations 
  as truth. For Lindsey and the Vineyard ministers, God's covenant with the Jews 
  is truth and it translates, according to Stephen R. Sizer, into the need for 
  America to &quot;continue military and economic funding of Israel,&quot; for 
  Israel to &quot;resist negotiating land for peace,&quot; &quot;maintain their 
  apartheid policies,&quot; and incite fundamentalist groups to destroy the Dome 
  of the Rock so the new temple can be built. Lindsey accuses those who refuse 
  to accept this eschatology as anti-Semitic. This transition from biblical prophecy 
  to current events translates myth into international policy emphasizing the 
  potential destructive power of mythology. Who are these self-appointed servants 
  of the Almighty who give direction to Israeli and US leaders regarding the establishment 
  of nation states, the conception and determination of evil, and the righteousness 
  of actions taken on behalf of their interpretation of God's word? </b></p>
<p><b>Lindsey believes, as we have noted, that the Spirit of God has given him 
  special insight &quot;into how this whole phenomenon encoded the prophecies&quot; 
  Others like James Ryle of Promise Keepers find God giving revelation through 
  dreams and visions; in Hippo in the Garden, he notes that he was called to preach 
  through a prophetic word situation (91). In either case, their interpretations 
  come from an indeterminable source, yet a source of vast power and consequence. 
  Lindsey writes &quot;Only now, as mankind approaches the third millennium, do 
  I feel like the Holy Spirit has provided me with the proper perspective &shy; 
  the Big Picture, so to speak &shy; on the mind blowing experiences of the modern 
  world&quot; (Planet Earth 2000 A.D.). And what are those &quot;mind blowing 
  experiences&quot;? &quot;I am certain The Second Advent will occur in the next 
  few years &shy; probably in your lifetime.&quot; And, &quot;the greatest threat 
  to freedom and world peace today &shy; is Islamic fundamentalism&quot; (The 
  Final Battle). Acceptance of these modern day prophets and their beliefs by 
  the elite in power portends disaster for American policy in the mid-east in 
  particular and for American interests generally. But, as we have seen, these 
  ministers of God have the ear of those in power in the current administration. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>Two issues arise immediately: why should America determine its future course 
  based on interpretations of God's word as contained in documents 2500 years 
  old, designed and written for civilizations long dead? And, second, what is 
  the evil that these modern day prophets determine as the threat against God's 
  predictions? </b></p>
<p><b>Plainly, the Books of Genesis, Daniel, and Revelation, the primary sources 
  for &quot;end-time theology,&quot; for &quot;Dominionism,&quot; for the Apocalyptic 
  perspective, and for Armageddon, while accepted by literalists as the word of 
  God, are in fact derivatives of stories and ideas from other cultures that anti-date 
  Moses by hundreds of years and John, the purported author of Revelation, by 
  more than 1700 years. How then can they be the word of God? How can Americans 
  take seriously the interpretations of Pseudo-prophets who claim to know the 
  meaning of prophecies when they are only the latest in a series of such claimants 
  that date back to Joachim of Fiore, an Italian monk of the 12th century, Christopher 
  Columbus in the early 1500s, Martin Luther, Thomas Muentzer in the 16th century, 
  the Puritans in America, the interpretations arising out of Nazism and Marxism, 
  William Miller and John Darby to mention a few who appeared before the most 
  recent group headed by Lindsey (PBS).</b></p>
<p><b>There can be no doubt that the Book of Revelation has had a searing impact 
  on the American conscience that dates back to the establishment of God's &quot;city 
  on a hill&quot; given to the Puritan's by God Himself. The absolute acceptance 
  of the forces of good and evil as extant and operative in the world, concepts 
  that date back to influences from ancient Greece and Persia in the 5th to 3rd 
  centuries before Christ, existed without question in the Puritan mind. Hope 
  in the eventual victory of the forces of good over evil, however, existed long 
  before the 5th century BCE in the &quot;Enuma and Elish&quot; stories of the 
  struggles between chaos and order that date to 1780 BCE in Mesopotamia. These 
  myths tell of Marduk, the God of light, struggling against Tiamat, the force 
  of evil, to bring order out of chaos and peace to the world (www.gatewaystobabylon.com). 
  The influence of these myths on the Book of Genesis, purportedly written by 
  Moses who was born in 1571, is unmistakable and conveyed directly in Psalm 74:14,15,16. 
  But Marduk is not Yahweh, yet current pseudo-prophets will declare the accuracy 
  of their visions as direct from God who speaks to humankind from the pages of 
  the Old and New Testaments. They fail to account for the origins of God's word 
  that comes from non-Jewish sources. Many ancient myths influenced the Bible: 
  the burning of the world by the Hindu God, Shiva; the Akkadian prophecies from 
  Mesopotamia; the messiah-like king that takes over the world, rewards the just, 
  and rules forever from the Uruk Prophecy; and the judgment of the dead by the 
  Egyptian god Maat for the good and evil they performed in their lifetime. (Patricia 
  Eddy, &quot;The Persian Connection: the End of the World Begins&quot;)</b></p>
<p><b>Judaism also borrowed &quot;angels, the holy spirit, paradise in heaven, 
  eternal life, Judgment Day, the resurrection of the dead, a fiery hell, a messianic 
  savior, and man's personal responsibility to do God's will&quot; from Persia 
  (http://www.alsopreview.com)/. These same concepts exist in Zoroaster's faith 
  that prevailed in the 6th century BCE. He designed a monotheistic God, Ahura 
  Mazda, considered by some as a precursor of the God of the Judaic Bible. Zoroaster's 
  last battle between the forces of good and evil, the biblical Armageddon, is 
  headed by a messiah known as Saoshyant; upon victory, he would herald in a millennium 
  of peace and plenty. An apocalypse preceded that last battle to gain the attention 
  of the people. Indeed, the Book of Revelation enlarges upon Zoroaster's end 
  of the world concepts as do sections in the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947 
  at Nag Hammadi and date to the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. </b></p>
<p><b>Unfortunately, Christians reading this literature have focused on the necessary 
  and inevitable return of the Jews to Judea-Samaria as conveyed in one source 
  written by a monk in 950 CE, Adso of Montier-En-Der at the request of Queen 
  Gerbera of France as he interpreted biblical passages. He also noted that there 
  would arise &quot;the Last World Emperor&quot; who would unite Christianity 
  and defeat Muslims before the Antichrist arises (PBS). This Christian Zionist 
  focus that requires the fulfillment of the covenant between God and His chosen 
  people arises from two broad predictions in the Old Testament: predictions of 
  a return to Palestine from the Babylonian exile and promises of Palestine as 
  the land given by God to the Jews. <br>
  Scholars argue about these predictions, some claiming that God fulfilled His 
  promises when the Jews returned to Palestine, rebuilt the Temple and the Walls 
  of Jerusalem, and restored the religious life of the community under the Maccabees; 
  others disagree (http://www.users.cloud9.net/). Citations of God's promises 
  to &quot;the descendants of Abraham&quot; for land appear in Genesis 12:7, 13:15, 
  15:18, 28:13-14 among others. The dispute caused by these passages has to do 
  with the &quot;seed&quot; to which God promised the land. Zionists argue that 
  God's promise was to Jews only; others argue that the seed of Abraham includes 
  Arabs (www.mideastfacts.com). Regardless of these indeterminable disputes, &quot;prominent 
  evangelists preach to their followers that God never fulfilled &quot;His promise 
  of giving all the land of Palestine to the Jews&quot; (http://www.mideastfacts.com/) 
  and, consequently, support &quot;whatever action necessary, even nuclear war, 
  to obtain Arab lands in the Middle East and give them to Jews.&quot; [emphasis 
  mine] (mideastfacts) Obviously, such interpretations bring the world to the 
  brink of nuclear holocaust and represent to many in the Christian community 
  a backward step in theology.</b></p>
<p><b>Is it possible to believe in the 21st century that a God, designed by a 
  small tribe of nomadic Semites 3500 years ago from stories and myths that existed 
  centuries before in the literatures of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan, and 
  elsewhere, could dictate to Americans how they should conduct foreign policy? 
  Myths after all are stories that explain for a people how they perceive their 
  existence in a world filled with mystery and awe. They create reference points 
  for the people to see connections between their condition and forces greater 
  than themselves or to understand how they must relate to the society that surrounds 
  them or to grapple with the internal energies that reside within themselves. 
  Yet we have in the union of Christian Zionists and Jewish Zionists mentalities 
  that find absolute truth in these myths and willingly inflict them on the American 
  populace. These beliefs bring ancient prophecies from myths into today's political 
  arena as this comment from Lindsey's Planet makes all too clear: &quot;The dispute 
  to trigger the war of Armageddon will arise between the Arabs and Israelis over 
  the Temple Mount and Old Jerusalem (Zachariah 12:2-3), the most contested and 
  strategic piece of real estate in the world Two religions, Judaism and Islam, 
  thus are on a collision course with global and heavenly repercussions. Islam 
  will never accept Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the Jewish state, and 
  Israel will never agree to give it up&quot;(155).</b></p>
<p><b>Consider the comments of Margot Patterson in the National Catholic Reporter 
  last October 11, 2002: &quot;Thousands of Christian Zionists met in Jerusalem 
  for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot to cheer Sharon and to declare their unconditional 
  support for the state of Israel.&quot; These people embrace &quot;end-time&quot; 
  theology and are supported in turn by right-wing Israelis who like the economic 
  and political support they bring to the Israeli cause. Christian fundamentalists 
  and Jewish Messianic settlers, according to Patterson, promise formation of 
  a &quot;Greater Israel&quot; that will usher in Armageddon. They, too, see war 
  between Muslims and Jews as bringing about the Second Coming. </b></p>
<p><b>Patterson quotes a variety of sources to enforce her perception of the political 
  impact these interpreters of God's word have on America's policies toward Israel 
  and Palestine. James Zogby, President of the Arab American Institute, argues 
  &quot;despite disclaimers to the contrary the US is waging a war on Islam at 
  home and abroad even as it tacitly supports extremist settlers in the occupied 
  territories Israel controls.&quot; Lewis Roth, President of Americans for Peace 
  Now, says &quot;You have a number of very conservative Christian groups that 
  support settlements because they see this as a way of strengthening Jewish hold 
  on the land of Israel because in their mind this is important for end-of-time 
  theology and part of hastening the Second Coming and the conversion of the Jews&quot; 
  Since Jews have their own Messianic reading of the biblical sources, different 
  from the Christian Zionists except in the necessity of fulfilling God's covenant 
  to return the Jews to Judea-Samaria, they find support of the Christian Zionists 
  helpful in bringing about the creation of Greater Israel that would include 
  not only the borders of the present state but the entire land of Israel described 
  in the Hebrew Scriptures. </b></p>
<p><b>Consider as well Robert Kaiser's February 9, 2003 article &quot;Bush and 
  Sharon Nearly Identical on Mideast Policy&quot; in the Washington Post. Kaiser 
  quotes Richard Pearle, chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board, &quot;Israel 
  should insist on Arab recognition of its claim to the biblical land of Israel 
  and should focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq;&quot; this despite 
  multiple UNSC resolutions that declare Israel in defiance of international law 
  by holding on to these lands. But there's more! Douglas Feith, undersecretary 
  of defense for policy, has written extensively on Israeli-Arab issues, and argues, 
  according to Kaiser, &quot;that Israel has as legitimate a claim to the West 
  Bank territories seized after the Six-Day War as it has to the land that was 
  part of the U.N. mandated Israel created in 1948.&quot; Indeed, Donald Rumsfeld 
  has made the same claim even as he demands that the UN force nations that defy 
  UN resolutions to comply: &quot;There was a war and they (neighboring countries) 
  lost a lot of real estate to Israel because Israel prevailed in that conflict.&quot; 
  Here are America's Defense Department spokesmen directly contradicting the UN 
  resolutions demanding that Israel comply with international law and the Geneva 
  Conventions. </b></p>
<p><b>Why do these individuals speak for America in this manner? Kaiser quotes 
  a senior official of the first Bush administration as saying &quot;Sharon played 
  the president like a violin: 'I'm fighting your war, terrorism is terrorism,' 
  and so on, Sharon did a masterful job.&quot; Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, also quoted 
  by Kaiser, claims &quot;President Bush's policy stems from his core as a Christian, 
  his perceptions of right and wrong, good and evil, and of the need to stand 
  up and fight against evilI personally believe it is very personal, not a political 
  maneuver on his part.&quot; Rev. Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention 
  echoed those sentiments when he noted how important evangelical support for 
  the president is and claimed, &quot;We need to bless Israel more than America 
  needs Israel's blessing because Israel has a far greater ally than the United 
  States of America, God Almighty.&quot; That observation, you will recall, ended 
  the President's State of the Union address as quoted above. In short, America 
  has at its helm a man who understands his role in God's plan and is determined 
  to carry forward regardless of the views of world leaders or the American people. 
  As Dr. Lower points out in Counterpunch, &quot;Bush's war version of God 'has 
  two dangerous implications' One is that those who have lost their lives in service 
  to God and country (Astronauts) 'weren't actually taking risks or showing bravery 
  because their fate was in God's hands. The other implication is that tragedies 
  are God's will.' This is in the tradition of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell 
  who suggested that the September 11th tragedy happened because God had removed 
  his active protection from an immoral United States.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>Bush is furthered in his drive to Armageddon by those who surround him, 
  both secular zealots intent on ensuring Israel's expansion to the biblical lands 
  given it by the covenant or by the religious right that supports Sharon and 
  controls great Jewish influence in America. Perhaps the most recent evidence 
  of this control on America's mid-east policy comes in the person of Elliott 
  Abrams, the recently appointed director of Mideast Affairs for the National 
  Security Council. Abrams has stated categorically: &quot;The Palestinian leadership 
  does not want peace with Israel, and there will be no peace.&quot; Given his 
  current position, we know the future of American policy in Palestine. Abrams' 
  prophecy of no peace allows the Christian Zionists and the Jewish Zionists to 
  usher in the forces of their perceived good against the forces of their perceived 
  evil, the Muslims. All of which makes possible the scenario prophesied by Hal 
  Lindsey in The Final Battle, making fiction truth and truth fiction.</b></p>

  III?</font><br>
  <b>Exclusive to American Free Press<br>
  By M. Raphael Johnson<br>
  11-8-3</b></p>
<p><b>According to a recent article by veteran British military analyst Joseph 
  Vialls, Russia has sent the most advanced and feared missile in the world, owned 
  only by Russia and China, the P270 Moskit, also known as the 'Sunburn,' to Damascus 
  and Tehran. This can only be understood as a counter to the Israeli threats 
  to use nuclear weapons against their enemies. The Sunburn flies at an altitude 
  of 60 feet and is nearly impossible to defend against. A few fired at Israel 
  could make that state 'history.</b></p>
<p><b>Add to this a new Russian air force installation near the Kyrgystan/Russia 
  border, coupled with a Chinese base just over their western border with Kyrgystan, 
  and Armageddon may be on the horizon. All Russian jets at this new base just 
  outside of Bishkek are equipped with Sunburn missiles. </b></p>
<p><b>Vialls writes: The gloves are off, and with America and Israel still unable 
  to steal any oil from Iraq because someone keeps blowing the pipelines, Russian 
  and Chinese firepower buildup suddenly slammed the door firmly shut on Caspian 
  oil reserves in the old Soviet republics. For more than a decade American oil 
  multinationals have been conducting 'joint ventures' in the former Soviet republics 
  bordering the Caspian Sea, with the stated intent of pumping stolen crude oil 
  out through Turkey, then on to western markets. Now this route has been blocked 
  permanently, and America is in no position to do anything about it, because 
  a large part of the U.S. conventional army is currently bogged down in Iraq, 
  being shot at and killed on a daily basis. <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>For many who have been watching this region as a confrontation between the 
  United States and Israel versus Russia largely over the control of the biggest 
  gas and oil deposits in the world, a new front has been opened. As a response 
  to this checkmate, Sharon recently visited Putin on Nov. 3 to meet with him 
  concerning the nuclear issue in Iran. Quickly, Sharon permitted Palestinians 
  to return to their jobs and eased their travel restrictions. <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>Since the end of the Gorbachev era, the Russian oligarchs, nearly all Jewish 
  by ethnicity (with the noticeable exception of Vladimir Potanin), have controlled 
  nearly all key sectors of the Russian economy. This, of course, includes Russia's 
  major ace-in-the-hole, oil and gas. The giant YUKOS conglomerate is presently 
  one of the largest oil companies in the world, valued at about $40 billion. 
  YUKOS is the result of a 'loans for shares' deal brokered through the semi-coherent 
  Boris Yeltsin in 1995. Here, the liberal Russian government swapped loyalty 
  from the oligarchs in exchange for privatization at prices far below that of 
  the market. This $40 billion giant was bought for about $300 million, thus looting 
  the entire Russian economy for the benefit of a handful of Israeli citizens 
  living in Russia. <br>

<p><b>When YUKOS' chair, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at the end of last 
  month, the American capitalist establishment went orbital. Forgetting the 1999 
  New York Times's expose on massive money laundering and fraud from YUKOS, the 
  conservative establishment began to lionize oligarchy and, specifically, Khodorkovsky. 
  Recently, The Financial Times weighed in with a giggly piece from Chrystia Freeland, 
  which referred to the oligarch as a 'democratic activist.' About a paragraph 
  later, the writer said - without irony - that the oligarch's model for economics 
  is the robber baron factories of the early American 20th century. Fox News, 
  on Nov. 3, referred to YUKOS as the most progressive corporation in Russia. 
  <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>According to a Nov. 3 Agence France-Presse story, Khodorkovsky made a deal 
  with Jacob Rothschild this year that control of the YUKOS giant would pass to 
  Rothschild in the event of Khodorkovsky's arrest. However, the Russian government 
  has frozen all YUKOS assets for the time being. It is significant that YUKOS's 
  liberal pressure group, the Open Russia Foundation, is completely controlled 
  by Rothschild now that its founder is in jail. As their official mission statement 
  reads, &quot;The motivation for the establishment of the Open Russia Foundation 
  is the wish to foster enhanced openness, understanding and integration between 
  the people of Russia and the rest of the world.&quot; <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>Their board of trustees includes Rothschild and Henry Kissinger. The Washington, 
  D.C. launch of the organization included Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Librarian 
  of Congress James Billington, one of the leading voices against Russian traditionalism 
  in the academic establishment. Significantly, the Open Russia Foundation recently 
  provided Yale University with substantial grants to study the Russian economy 
  as well as providing the Carnegie Foundation with 3 percent of its entire operating 
  budget. <br>
  It seems that the drive to control the globe's energy is progressing. The American 
  empire's battles in Serbia, Central Asia, Iraq and Chechnya are one and the 
  same war. Other than fighting Israel's enemies, these adventures are also wars 
  to control Central Asian oil and natural gas (one of the main pipelines from 
  the Caspian Sea went straight through Serbia). The control of this wealth by 
  the United States and Israel necessitates bypassing Russian channels. This means 
  that the Jewish oligarchy in Russia would become the central actor in world 
  politics. <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>The Israeli/CIA complex was using Khodorkovsky to sell off the assets of 
  YUKOS to Exxon/Mobil (as well as a smaller piece to Texaco), hence bringing 
  Russia's pipelines into the hands of the western powers. The Nov. 5 New York 
  Times also indicated that the Bush family's Carlyle Group was involved. It was 
  not long after Putin began threatening the YUKOS conglomerate that neo-conservative 
  pundits such as William Kristol and Ariel Cohen began calling Putin a 'communist,' 
  'another Stalin' and 'tyrannical.' <br>
  The basis of these wild accusations, of course, is the fact that Putin stands 
  in the way of Zionist domination. </b></p>
<p><b>From this, the roles of several other variables and players develop clearly. 
  The State Department/Harvard University alliance was meant to 'deregulate,' 
  or 'privatize' much of the Russian economy precisely to keep the Russian state 
  out of the equation. Therefore, pro-Israel oligarchs (that is, Israeli citizens 
  living in Russia) then benefited, placing most of the economy in their hands, 
  and, by extension, Israel's. Russia's response has been to clamp down on further 
  foreign penetration into defense and other sensitive industries, and specifically, 
  to target those believed to be working for both the CIA and Mossad and attempting 
  to control Central Asian oil. </b></p>
<p><b>It needs to be reiterated that where the (CIA goes, Mossad goes as well. 
  Israeli and American interests have come together in the dominance of the Central 
  Asian region and therefore, so have liberal ideology, the Beltway set, neo-conservatism, 
  Ivy League eggheads, Christian Zionism, the Rothschilds and the American media.) 
  Afghanistan through the Caspian Sea through to Georgia, Azerbaijan and into 
  the Balkans (not to mention pipelines leading to oil-hungry China), have become 
  one single theater of war over trillions of dollars in oil and gas wealth, incorporating 
  every single power center in global politics. The battle against the New World 
  Order is being decided in Moscow. </b></p>
<p><b>Therefore, all anti-Russian alliances in the region, from Islamic fundamentalism 
  to Slavic separatism to the George Soros 'Open Society' Foundation, are in the 
  interests of the CIA/Exxon/Ivy League/NWO complex. In Azerbaijan, for example, 
  American elites have pushed for a 'democratic' state, that is, a state not under 
  the control of pro-Moscow Heydar Aliev, thus leaving the country open to U.S. 
  oil investment. Aliev, of course, is promoting Russian interests in the region, 
  and thus, has become a &atilde;tyrant&auml; in the Beltway mind. <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>The American response to this situation within this region is to create 
  the GUAAM pact, including, Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova. 
  Cohen gives us a clue as to why this entity was brokered under NATO auspices: 
  &quot;The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline will export up to 1 million barrels per 
  year of high quality Caspian crude oil by 2005.&quot; In other words, billions 
  of dollars of oil are slated to be pumped through this region very soon, and 
  the economic/military alliance of GUAAM is the means to ensure American control 
  over it. This connects the Serbian, Afghan and Iraqi wars. Russia's response 
  to Israel's terror threats against most of the Islamic world is fully understood 
  as both a political and economic question. Further, increasing cooperation between 
  Russia and India, as well as China, are clear markers that Putin, one of the 
  few actually competent leaders in world politics, is building an anti-imperialist 
  and anti-NATO alliance with the aim of countering American/Zionist moves for 
  the world's oil and gas wealth. <br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>The interests, however, go even further than Zionist control over American 
  foreign policy decision-making. Vialls writes on another topic: that the existence 
  of the American/Zionist empire is based on the victory of American forces over 
  the Russian and Islamic. Of course, both in Bosnia and Chechnya, the Mossad/CIA 
  operatives have not hesitated to assist fundamentalists in fighting Slavic nationalism, 
  largely because Slavicism is a greater threat with Putin firmly in the saddle. 
  Islam, divided and leaderless, with a history of centuries of defeat and colonialism 
  behind it, is only a potential force in world politics. <br>
