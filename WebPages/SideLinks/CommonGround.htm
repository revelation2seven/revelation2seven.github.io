<p><font size="+1">Our recent visit to the Sonoma County region of California 
  (after the events of September 11th), has been an enlightening one, in more 
  than one way. While walking through the town of Guerneville, situated along 
  the deep, lush, forested banks of the Russian River, we did not only come to 
  realize that in some metaphorical way, if the history of the present age is 
  coming to its fulness (to its own <i>End</i>), on the East Coast, in the events 
  that have now begun to come to pass in places such as New York City and Washington 
  D.C., the New Age seems to be being born out there in the West. There seems 
  to be a different concentration of energy there, of new ways of thinking, and 
  of forming relationships, to ideas, to the environment and to each other. And 
  then again, perhaps it only seems that way, maybe it's just the atmosphere, 
  or those majestic Redwoods.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> On our walk, however, we came across the Winter 2001/2002 
  edition of <i>Common Ground</i>. In it are two articles that speak clearly to 
  what could become a spiritual crisis between the two (an interruption in the 
  Force), if it is not addressed soon: the inability, or disinclination if you 
  will, of many in the New Age movement to make the necessary mental leap backwards 
  from the emerging, post-biblical state of consciousness to the very words of 
  the Hebrew prophets upon which the end of this Western epoch and the birth of 
  the New depend. Those coming to the <i>New</i> seem, in some very critical (but 
  also understandable) way, to be disdainful. or neglectful of the <i>old </i>paradigm, 
  what with its emphasis on war, its homage to the God of War, and its very complicated 
  discourse on the duality between good and evil, Light and Darkness. While we 
  know full well that the mind coming to a state of spiritual perfection must 
  be able to transcend every element of duality, we, at the same time, and in 
  this same interest, would invite everyone to please click on the television, 
  open the daily papers, enter the conversation, accept the present reality, and 
  (with that one quantum leap of the imagination) see God risen up everywhere 
  in the earth, preparing in all of these events, in these same unfolding divisions 
  between the Light and Darkness, to bring this entire age to its just and timely 
  conclusion. An understanding of these things requires recourse to the words 
  of the Hebrew prophets. They can not be neglected. It requires a realization 
  that the God of Heaven and Earth, who has hidden Themselves (They are ONE) throughout 
  all of these millennia, in all of the subjective realities of the Eastern world 
  as it is, is now appearing in all of the objective realities of the West, to 
  the mind of the West itself. They are appearing to bring the entire Divine epic, 
  the Great Circle of History, the history of this Adamic age, to its foreordained 
  and created end...or rather, to its New beginning: </font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In Virginia Lee's interview of Surya Das, <i>On Finding the 
  Inner Light</i>, we are drawn into that part of the conversation that speaks 
  in the most eloquent way--from what appears to be an almost wholly Buddhist 
  point of view--of those most excellent precepts of personal transformation and 
  self-realization that inform the soul, but which are, in fact, the underlying 
  basis, not only of Buddhist thought but of Judeo-Christian thought as well. 
  The living reality is, and it is evident once we find our way into the secret, 
  higher meaning of the Christian Solar/Lunar Mystery, that the first Christians 
  (that school of Essenes and <i>Merkabah </i>mystics who also gave us the Gospels), 
  were also Buddhists in the most Western sense of the term. They were <i>awakened</i>. 
  But it is all concealed in the structure of the Mystery itself. For those mystics, 
  the precepts of Buddhism were an unspoken pathway into the higher dimensions 
  of the Universal World Tree that span the Earth from one end to the other. These 
  precepts lent an essential spiritual dimension to the Mystery of the Cross, 
  to the ultimate meaning of life and death, which is itself central to the structure 
  of the World Tree. There was no need to expound on it: <i>The wise would understand</i>. 
  Besides, it was all being sealed up again (Revelation 5:1), so that when all 
  the books were opened in the last days and the seals unsealed, it would be the 
  sons and daughters of Light, and all who yield to them for enlightenment, who 
  would understand...while the great sons of Darkness went on to reveal themselves 
  in the earth in their most darkly-glorious and powerful ways. This is the reality 
  that is unfolding in the earth, and it is here where Surya Das and Virginia 
  Lee's conversation cannot carry the day. It falls instead, and with a terrible 
  weight, on those who can expound on these matters from a wholly developed, Western, 
  prophetic frame of mind. </font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Ms. Lee asks Surya Das: &quot;How does one live peacefully 
  in such a violent world?&quot; His response speaks to all of those who, in the 
  absence of Divine revelation, and for all practical purposes, <i>are </i>trying 
  to live peacefully in the midst of a violent world--and now more particularly, 
  in the midst of the post September 11 world. But the great psychological reality 
  is, that even the <i>sons of Darkness, </i>those against whom God is now rising 
  up everywhere in the earth, are also trying to figure out how to live in peace 
  in the midst of a violent world, one, however, which they themselves have done 
  much to create, and which they themselves are presently going to great, violent 
  extremes to preserve. And as a result of the subtle regards with which they 
  hold themselves--the <i>newspeak </i>terms in which they now define themselves, 
  the <i>light</i> in which they see themselves (as peacemakers and peacekeepers)--they 
  see no contradiction between Surya Das's sentiments and their own. Except for 
  them, the only immediate way to the peaceful world that they, and every one 
  else seems to desire, is through the institution and commission of war. And 
  in the absence of Divine revelation everyone seems to be in some full, or at 
  least halfhearted accord with them. The flags and the slogans are flying everywhere 
  on their side of the divide, and on this side there is quiet and bewildered 
  approbation. (There is, of course, a growing antiwar movement in this country, 
  but it is not seeing the picture either). In the midst of it all we continue 
  to express our spiritual ideals and our hopes for a peaceful world, while the 
  powers that be, in their own grossly darkened states of mind, continue, determined 
  as ever, to recreate it in their own social, economic and wholly militaristic 
  image. (1 Thessalonians 5. KJV). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When asked how he would spend a half hour with the President, 
  and if he would even try to persuade him to choose the non-violent path, Surya 
  Das replied: &quot;No, I don't think so...I probably wouldn't even try.&quot; 
  This, of course, is in keeping with the higher reality. These great leaders 
  are incapable of the non-violent path--the very path that will determine the 
  children of Light in these times from the children of Darkness, and which will 
  determine who can, and cannot, inherit the age to come and the world to come. 
  <i>I set before you life and death</i>, Moses wrote. <i>Choose Life! </i>These 
  great men, and all who follow them, have chosen the ways of Death. They have 
  chosen war in a time of war; but not only that, in the name of Christ they have 
  risen up in the earth in violation of all the teachings of Christ. This is the 
  spirit of <i>antichrist </i> in the world. (1 John 2:15-19). Surya Das said: 
  &quot;I think I would (instead) try to listen and learn.&quot; Well this is 
  a very ethical approach, but ethical to a fault, because, again, in the absence 
  of the full implications of the Hebrew revelation, it lapses naively against 
  those words which say: <i>And have no fellowship with the Unfruitful Works of 
  Darkness, but rather reprove them.</i> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In response to the question: &quot;Is there such a thing as 
  a holy war?&quot; Surya Das is correct when he says: &quot;It does seem like 
  a contradiction in terms.&quot; We agree, but please let us apply this contradiction 
  in terms, not to those who are self-proclaimed slaves of Allah, and who blindly 
  and obediently do Allah's will, but directly to the leaders of America--to those, 
  that is, who claim to be freemen, who claim throughout all of these affairs 
  to be true Christians, as if one could, indeed, <i>Sit at two tables, drink 
  from two cups</i> and <i>swing two swords</i>. &quot;The word <i>jihad</i>,&quot; 
  Surya Das says, &quot;actually means <i>struggle</i>. Words like <i>jihad</i> 
  and <i>crusade</i> have been misused to mean holy war. A crusade doesn't mean 
  going to kill infidels, it means making a big effort in a certain direction.&quot; 
  And he is also correct, but in a very spiritually naive way, when he goes on 
  to say: &quot;The prophet Mohammed himself said that the real <i>jihad</i> is 
  to overcome the evil in yourself, the inner enemies of hatred, intolerance and 
  ignorance.&quot; He is naive, because in his attempt to explain the meaning 
  of <i>jihad</i> he unwittingly applies to God those precepts that are only applicable 
  to men. The Hebrew prophets are explicit in their description of God. He is 
  <i>a Man of War</i>, and a <i>Consuming Fire,</i> which is why God sent the 
  Christ-spirit into the world, to teach all of us how to behave in a time of 
  war. The commandment is explicit: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Follow peace with all men, </font></i><font size="3">(at 
    all times, and in every situation)</font><i><font size="+1">, and holiness, 
    without which no man shall see the Lord...</font></i><font size="+1">(Hebrews 
    12:14).</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, 
    be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Peter 3:14). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Surya Das, sainted soul that he is, is nevertheless naive and 
  childlike in his neglect of the Hebrew scriptures (as are almost everyone else), 
  thus in his inability to realize that God (who dwells in the sum of Reality 
  Itself) has been rising to this occasion in history since the very beginning 
  of the time of Adam, about six thousand years ago, when the very first commandment 
  to non-violence appeared in the earth. It came with the revelation to Adam/Manu 
  in the garden of Eden. It might be said to be a wholly Western thing (not the 
  idea of non-violence, but the first commandment to it), one to which we--all 
  of us together--are now returned. It gave rise in its earliest forms to Vedic 
  consciousness, it predates Buddhism, and it is from this point in history alone, 
  with the world's first revelation of God's Singular Presence in the world--in 
  the sum of all unfolding realities (in all of the elements of the Day and the 
  Night, in the Good as well as the Evil)--that man first became capable of violating 
  the sublime implications of that revelation. <i>For where there is no law </i>(no 
  Veda, no Torah, no teaching)<i>, there is no transgression</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">History had to unfold as it has</font><font size="+1">, in 
  order for us to be fully created in the image of God. And it was from that point 
  of history--when it is said that Cain (a figure now of the newly-emerging, and 
  newly-collective lower consciousness in Western man), rose up to slay his brother 
  Abel, (who now represented the newly emerging, and newly informed spirit of 
  non-violence in the earth), one that is being brought to its perfection in the 
  Universal Christ Mystery in our time)--that we must begin to interpret the things 
  that are now transpiring in the world. It is this spirit of Cain (the one that 
  was <i>marked</i> in those ancient times because of his violence against his 
  brother, his continuous warring ways, thus his disdain for the revelations and 
  teachings of his spiritual parents), that has now risen up powerful in the earth. 
  And it is this same spirit of Cain that God is now rising up against in the 
  earth. How? By bringing the spirit of Cain in the earth up against itself, and 
  then up against <i>Himself</i>. Thus the extreme, fundamentalist spirit of Islam 
  has been set loose against the violent ones of Judaeo-Christianity, so that 
  both, but particularly these latter ones, can finally be brought to justice 
  in the world. Dark answers to Dark...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is Muslims against Jews, Jews against Muslims; Muslims against 
  Christians, Christians against Muslims; Muslims against Hindus, Hindus against 
  Muslims; Catholics against Protestants; Orthodox against Catholics against Muslims 
  against Jews. It is the spirit of Cain, the Dark one, risen up everywhere in 
  the earth against himself, and against God. But it is more than just this. In 
  the final battle it is angels against men. It is the spirit of Cain now risen 
  up in the earth in stout defiance of those other principalities and powers in 
  the earth that God has reserved to Himself against the great day of battle and 
  war. It all seems like geopolitics to the unaided eye, and facts on the ground, 
  but this is the great delusion, or illusion if you will, <i>Maya</i>. It is 
  nothing less than the unfolding of Divine Will. No! It is more than that. It 
  is the very Presence of the Divine itself. There is nothing in the universe 
  as Terrible as God. There is nothing in the universe but God).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the corresponding article, <i>The September 11 Crisis: Responding 
  With Our Spiritual Ideals</i>, Dr. Todd Pressman, after trying to walk a tightrope 
  between these two worlds, the Spiritual and the Mundane, rationalizing all of 
  his own uncertainties about these great unfolding realities, falls right down 
  on the side of Darkness. He empowers the spirit of <i>antichrist </i>when he 
  says: &quot;Neither is it a call to pacifism,&quot; when this is exactly what 
  it is. He gets it all twisted when he says: &quot;To set the stage in which 
  healing can take place may require the use of force.&quot; On whose part? God's 
  or man's? He says that &quot;Jesus was (also) quite forceful in his <i>attack</i> 
  on the Pharisees...&quot; His <i>attack</i>? Was this like an American attack 
  on Afghanistan or Iraq? And who were these Pharisees that the Scriptures make 
  use of in these texts? They were those who, though they knew there was a mystery, 
  did not know it. Though they knew there was a higher world, they instead rationalized 
  their place in the lower world. They lived in both worlds, and, in moments of 
  indecision, would fight and die, and kill others, in the unguided interest of 
  the one against the other. Jesus did not <i>attack</i> the pharisees, he attacked 
  their theology. Likewise, Pressman, in his capitulation to the Dark side, says: 
  &quot;Too often, pacifism disguises a fear of taking needed action...When force 
  is used to stop further violence, it can be seen as a prerequisite in the process 
  of healing and <i>forgiveness. </i>Without it, we may never feel safe enough 
  to begin the work of transforming our fear.&quot; The opposite, however, will 
  finally prove to be true. The continued use of force, and the present ongoing 
  exertion of Western self-will in the face of these Divine realities, will only 
  serve to enflame the further wrath of God, in violation of that epic precept 
  which says: <i>Ye shall kindle no Fire on the Sabbath days. </i>Pressman, of 
  course, has also disregarded the precepts of the Hebrew prophets.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Surya Das, in response to the question: &quot;Do you see an 
  endgame to what's going on now?&quot; says: &quot;No...&quot; Of course he says 
  more than that, but herein lies the crux, the difference that exists between 
  the present, New Age application of Eastern ideas and the words and long-range 
  visions of the Hebrew prophets. The Hebrew prophets were able to see into the 
  oracles of Time and Space, across the vortex separating human consciousness 
  from Divine, into the events of our times. Gutauma saw the same. He saw into 
  all times, however, into the fabric of space and time itself, but not into the 
  events of our time. The Hebrew prophets were able to see Nature (the Great Angel 
  of Divine Presence) rising up in all of its Terrible Glory to bring an end at 
  last to the age of violence and oppression, an end to injustice, ignorance, 
  and warfare in the earth. How? By bringing all of these things into the glaring 
  Light of Day. By revealing them to the mind of Light, and by bringing the whole 
  world to its present moment of decision, and to the only possible set of conditions 
  out of which the Child of Revelation (the next Age) could be born--thus to the 
  words: <i>Come out from among them and be ye separate</i>. (2 Corinthians 6:14-18; 
  Revelation, chapter 18). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> We are all experiencing the birth pains and contractions of 
  this great coming event. These, of course, are the labors of the Divine Mother 
  Herself. She is appearing out of the invisible dimensions of Her own created 
  order where She has been hiding Herself and all of the mysteries of the Divine 
  Feminine Principle all of these centuries. Just as She gave birth two thousand 
  years ago, to the age in which we now reside (a Mystery that was sealed up with 
  Seven seals), She is descending again (or revealing Herself again, She has never 
  left), in the midst of all these unfolding cosmic events to give birth to the 
  Age to come. Only the mind of Light can be born into the Light of that already-present 
  reality. There is, however, another equally-present reality--the age of Darkness 
  is not complete. The rulers of this Darkness will make their final attempts 
  now at creating and ordering the world in their own <i>godlike</i> image. How 
  is it written? <i>And the dragon, </i>(the great spirit of antichrist in the 
  earth, the collective lower consciousness of Western man), <i>stood before the 
  Woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour Her child as soon as it 
  was born</i>. Be born. </font></p>
