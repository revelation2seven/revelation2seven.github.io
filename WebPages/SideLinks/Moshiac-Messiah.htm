  <b>AWAITING MOSHIACH IN THE &quot;INSTANT AGE.&quot;</b><br>
  <b>by Yehudis Cohen</b> </div>
<p>You are waiting for something important a letter, a package, information to 
  include in a report. You are certain it should have already come. The deadline 
  is fast approaching Each time the telephone rings you hope. Every person who 
  passes through the door could be the messenger-service. The mailman and the 
  UPS truck take on a new importance. You are on edge, waiting and waiting. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Has the above ever happened to you? Or maybe you remember waiting for a new 
  refrigerator to replace the broken one in the midst of a heat-wave... the results 
  of a medical diagnosis... news about promotions or lay-offs...<b>the imminent 
  arrival of a baby</b>... your refund from the IRS.</p>

<p> <b>A Taste of Moshiach Why are Jews so Obsessed with Moshiach?</b></p>
<p><b>Jews are especially good at waiting. One of the thirteen fundamental principles 
  of the Jewish faith as formulated by Maimonides is: &quot;I believe with complete 
  faith in the coming of Moshiach, and although he may tarry, nevertheless, I 
  wait every day for him to come.&quot; That's a pretty heavy belief for our generation 
  of Jews, most of whom intellectually at least-have more faith in a global nuclear 
  war with no survivors than they have in the Messianic Age. And yet, this belief 
  in Moshiach has stayed with us throughout the millennia.</b></p>
<p><b>Every single day, we are supposed to wait for and expect the arrival of 
  Moshiach, much like the impatiently awaited arrival of an important item or 
  event. So why don't we? </b></p>
<p><b>Shh, here's a secret. Many of us, before we ever heard or read that Jews 
  believe &quot;with complete faith in the coming of Moshiach&quot; were already 
  very knowledgeable about non-Jewish culture and beliefs. So much so that when 
  we finally learned about Mochiach, the World to Come, the Resurrection of the 
  Dead--from an authentic, Jewish stand-point--they were already ingrained in 
  our minds as being very non-Jewish--treif. Thus, a new-age, non-sectarian, war 
  ultimately destroying the world seems to be so much more a reality than a time 
  of world-peace and complete disarmament, when everyone will believe in G-d, 
  when the wolf will live with the lamb (i.e. the wicked will live peacefully 
  alongside the righteous). </b></p>
<p><b>So what's the solution? How do we start believing in Moshiach, let alone 
  avidly awaiting his arrival every day? Simply by starting: by reading, discussing, 
  thinking, asking. By allowing ourselves to be open-minded enough to realize 
  that Moshiach is possible.<br>

<p>LEGENDS OF THE MESSIAH </p>
<p><b>OF the SIX things which existed before creation,</b> <b>when only 'the spirit 
  of God moved upon the face of the waters</b>,' two, the Torah and the throne 
  of God, were complete in every detail. The remaining four, however, viz., the 
  Patriarchs, Israel, the Temple, <b>and the name of Messiah</b>, existed prior 
  to the creation only in an incomplete form.--Gen. Rabba 1.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../UsedImages/pg06.gif"><img src="../../UsedImages/Pg148b.gif" width="157" height="176" border="0"></a></p>
<p>From the time of creation constant reference is made in Holy Writ to Messiah 
  and the Messianic hope of Israel. 'The Spirit of God moved upon the face of 
  the waters'; the Spirit of God means Messiah.--Gen. Rabba 2; also Levit. Rabba 
  14.</p>
<p>When Eve at the birth of Seth exclaimed, 'God hath appointed me another seed.' 
  her underlying thought was the King Messiah.--Gen. Rabba 23.</p>
<p>He who knows how long the Israelites worshipped idols can learn therefrom when 
  the Son of David--Messiah--will come. Three different prophets tell us this: 
  (1) 'Like as you have forsaken Me, and served strange gods in your land, so 
  shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours' (Jer. 5. 19); (2) 'And 
  I will visit her the days of Baalim,' etc., (Hos. 2. 13); (3) 'Yea, they made 
  their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the law, and the words 
  which the Lord hath sent in his spirit by the prophets. Therefore it is come 
  to pass that as he cried and they would not hear, so they cried and I would 
  not hear, saith the Lord' (Zech. 7. 12, 13).--Lament. Rabba 1.</p>
<p>The great mountain spoken of by the prophet...Zechariah (4. 7) is no other 
  than Messiah, Son of David, and he is called 'the Great Mountain,' because he 
  towers above the Patriarchs, is greater than Moses, and is above the ministering 
  angels. As Isaiah says (52. 10), 'Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he 
  shall be exalted and extolled and be very high.'--Midr. Tanchuma Toldos.</p>
<p>The word (Hadrach), used by the prophet Zechariah (9. 1), is one of the titles 
  of Messiah. It is connected with the word (leading), and is therefore applied 
  to him who will lead man to repentance.--Midr. Song of Songs 7.</p>
<p>The 'four carpenters' to whom the prophet also refers, are Elijah, Melchizedek, 
  the Messiah of war, called by some Messiah son of Joseph, and the true Messiah. 
  These Messiahs are referred to in the 32nd chapter of Isaiah, and their existence 
  is constantly mentioned. Seven or eight Messiahs are sometimes said to be promised 
  in the words of the Prophet Micah (5. 5), 'Then shall we raise against him seven 
  shepherds and eight principal men,' but it is held that there will be but four 
  (Zech. 1. 20), and these are they: Elijah the Tishbite, an unnamed man of the 
  tribe of Manasseh, Messiah of war--an Ephraimite, and Messiah the Great, the 
  descendant of David.--Midr. Song of Songs 2.</p>
<p>Two of King David's descendants were destined for universal dominion: King 
  Solomon and King Messiah, to whom David refers in his seventy-second Psalm.--Numb. 
  Rabba U</p>
<p>The whole of the 27th chapter of Isaiah refers to the Messiah.--Exod. Rabba 
  1.</p>
<p>Solomon's Song has also reference to Messiah. 'The voice of the turtle is heard 
  in our land' means the voice of Messiah.--Midr. Song of Songs 2.</p>
<p>When King Solomon speaks of his 'beloved,' he usually means Israel the nation. 
  In one instance he compares his beloved to a roe, and therein he refers to a 
  feature which marks alike Moses and the Messiah, the two redeemers of Israel. 
  just as a roe comes within the range of man's vision only to disappear from 
  sight and then appear again, so it is with these redeemers. Moses appeared to 
  the Israelites, then disappeared, and eventually appeared once more, and the 
  same peculiarity we have in connexion with Messiah; He will appear, disappear, 
  and appear again.--Numb. Rabba 11.</p>
<p>The fourteenth verse in the second chapter of Ruth is thus explained. 'Come 
  thou hither' is the prediction of Messiah's kingdom. 'Dip the morsel in the 
  vinegar,' foretells the agony through which Messiah will pass, as it is written 
  in Isaiah (cap. 51), 'He was wounded for our sins, He was bruised for our transgressions.' 
  'And she set herself beside the reapers' predicts the temporary departure of 
  Messiah's kingdom. 'And he reached her a parched corn' means the restoration 
  of His kingdom.--Midr. Ruth 5.</p>
<p>To three individuals God said, 'Ask, and it shall be given to thee.' These 
  are Solomon, Ahaz, and Messiah, to the last of whom it was promised, 'Ask of 
  Me, and I shall give Thee the heathens for Thine inheritance.'--Gen. Rabba 44.</p>
<p>In a similar strain we read, Israel is to overcome ten of the heathen nations 
  of the world; seven of them have already been conquered; the remaining three 
  will fall at the advent of Messiah.--Gen. Rabba 44. But, despite all this, Messiah 
  will not come till all those who are to be created have made their appearance 
  in the world.--Gen. Rabba 24.</p>
<p>In tracing the descent and history of the Israelites, the Bible enumerates 
  the generations of the heads of the families of the earth whose history touched 
  that of the chosen people. 'These are the generations of the heavens and the 
  earth' is the first instance of the use of the word in such a connexion. If 
  regard be had to the Hebrew text of the verse, it will be found that here the 
  word referred to is written in full, i.e. spelt (....) with the additional ( 
  ), whilst in all other places where the word occurs the word is always spelt 
  with one ?, thus (....). This, it will be found, is the invariable usage until 
  we come to, 'Now these are the generations of Perez' (Ruth 4. 18). Here we once 
  again find the word (....) spelt in full. These are the only two instances in 
  the whole of the Bible. The first refers to the time before the sin and fall 
  of Adam, which brought death into the world, and, inconsequence, all succeedinG 
  (....), 'generations,' were deprived of some of the possibilities of life, and 
  this is indicated by the omission of the ?. But the enumeration of the descendants 
  of Perez, bringing appreciably nearer the promised abolition of death through 
  the agency of his descendant, the Messiah, is hailed as the occasion to celebrate 
  the restoration to perfect man of what he had lost through the imperfection 
  of the first of his kind, and hence the word (....) is here spelt in full.--Exod. 
  Rabba 30.</p>
<p>A similar deduction is made with reference to the spelling of the word ?????? 
  'he-goats.' Each of the princes of Israel brought as a sacrifice at the dedication 
  of the tabernacle five he-goats. This word is spelt without the ?, thus, ????? 
  in all the numerous repetitions of the details of the offerings, which are identically 
  the same in all instances. There is but one exception, and that is (Numb. 7. 
  17) in the account of the offerings brought by Nachshon, son of Aminadab, because 
  from him were to spring six (the numerical value of ?) of the great men of Israel, 
  who were each to be distinguished by six special attributes. The Messiah and 
  his ancestor David are among the six, and Isaiah thus enumerates the six distinguishing 
  traits in the character of the descendant of Jesse, whose coming he foretells. 
  'And there shall rest upon him (1) the</p>
<p>p. 46</p>
<p>Spirit of the Lord, (2) the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, (3) the Spirit 
  of counsel, (4) and might, (5) the Spirit of knowledge, and (6) the Spirit of 
  the Lord.'--Numb. Rabba 13.</p>
<p>Abraham, Job, Hezekiah, and Messiah found God out for themselves without being 
  previously instructed.--Numb. Rabba 14.</p>
<p>The great gifts of God, of which Adam was deprived by reason of his sin and 
  fall--light being one of them--will all be restored through Messiah, who will 
  appear from the North and rebuild the Temple in the South.--Numb. Rabba 13.</p>
<p>The prophecy of Isaiah concerning Jerusalem, 'Behold, thy sons shall come from 
  afar and thy daughters shall be nursed by thy side,' could not be hailed with 
  the same satisfaction as the words of Zechariah, 'Behold, thy King cometh unto 
  thee; he is just and having salvation, lonely and riding upon an ass.' This 
  latter prophecy will bring it about that the daughter of Zion shall greatly 
  rejoice in the Lord, her soul shall be joyful in her God.--Midr. Song of Songs 
  1.</p>
<p>So greatly shall Zion rejoice and so glorious will be the restoration of the 
  Temple service in the days of Messiah, that three additional strings will be 
  required besides the seven that were formerly upon the harps used by the Levites. 
  In this way only will it be possible for the whole people to give expression 
  to the depths of reverence for their God that shall then stir their hearts.--Numb. 
  Rabba 15. and Tanchuma Behaloscho.</p>
<p>It was indeed pre-ordained that Jerusalem should be lost to the Israelites, 
  but only until the coming of him concerning whom it was said, 'Rejoice greatly, 
  O daughter of Zion.'--Gen. Rabba 56.</p>
<p>And so the destruction of Jerusalem is to be locked upon as an event bringing 
  joy in its train rather than as an irreparable loss or sorrow, for through it 
  the coming of the Messiah and consequent expiation of</p>
<p>p. 47</p>
<p>Israel's sin were rendered possible. For, just as all sacrifices were formerly 
  brought to Jerusalem, so in future shall messengers come with offerings to Messiah, 
  and all kings shall prostrate themselves before him.--Midr. Esther 1.</p>
<p>As you brought Me the perpetual light in the Temple, says God unto Israel, 
  so will I bring unto you Him, Messiah, who is the personification of light, 
  'the sun of righteousness' promised through Malachi.--Midr. Tanchuma Tetzava.</p>
<p>Our father Abraham, by his meritorious life, won for himself the blessing. 
  'Tell the stars, if thou art able to number them,' He said unto him; 'so shall 
  be thy children.' Isaac's ready compliance with God's demand to sacrifice his 
  life evoked the promise, 'I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven.' 
  Jacob was heartened with the prospect, 'And thy seed shall be as the dust of 
  the earth.' That which God promised to Abraham He has already fulfilled in that 
  Moses was able to address to his people the words, 'The Lord your God hath multiplied 
  you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.'</p>
<p>Balaam was constrained to acknowledge the impossibility of 'counting the dust 
  of Jacob,' and it might seem as if the prophet Hosea looked forward to the speedy 
  realization of the promise made to Isaac when he gave utterance to the sentiment, 
  'Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which 
  cannot be measured or numbered.' The fulfilment, however, will not come about 
  until the time of the Messiah, when the heathen shall be altogether absorbed 
  and God will pour out His Spirit upon all flesh.--Numb. Rabba 2.</p>
<p>The honour and majesty with which David tells us (Ps. 104.) that God is clothed, 
  He will bestow on Messiah. As it is said, 'His glory is great in Thy salvation, 
  honour and majesty hast Thou laid upon Him.'--Numb. Rabba 14.</p>
<p>p. 48</p>
<p>Seeing in his spirit of prophecy that the time would come when the ????, 'Mishkan' 
  (the Sanctuary) would cease to exist and the Shechinah dwell no more in Israel's 
  midst, Moses was anxious to know by what means the sins of his people would 
  then be expiated. The Almighty vouchsafed the information that He would choose 
  a righteous man from their midst, and make him a ???? (pledge) for them, and 
  through him their sins would be forgiven.--Exod. Rabba 35.</p>
<p>The prophets formerly recorded the good deeds performed by man, but now Elijah 
  and Messiah record them and God puts His seal on the record.--Levit. Rabba 34.</p>
<p>'Fear not, Abraham; I am thy shield and thine exceeding great reward,' refers 
  to the glorious epoch of Messiah. The Patriarch was apprehensive lest the covenant 
  made with him might not prove lasting because of the sins of his descendants. 
  God here gave him the assurance that, though his descendants fall into sin, 
  there shall be one great and noble amongst them, who will be qualified to say 
  to the avenging angel, 'Stay thy hand.' 'Him will I accept and he shall be a 
  pledge for my people.'--Midr. Song of Songs 1.</p>
<p>'The sceptre shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet 
  until &quot;Shiloh&quot; come,' refers also to Messiah, who is to enlighten 
  Israel on the words of the Torah, and point out the errors of the people. Rabbi 
  Chanan, on the other hand, holds that the teaching of Messiah will not be addressed 
  to Israel, whose knowledge of the law of God will be all-sufficient. Rather 
  will his task be to instruct the Gentiles: in the words of the prophet Isaiah 
  (11. 10), 'To him shall the Gentiles seek, and he shall assemble the outcast 
  of Israel.'--Gen. Rabba 98.</p>
<p>The faithful of Israel are desirous of sepulture in the land of Palestine because, 
  at the advent of Messiah, the resurrection will take place there before any 
  other part</p>
<p>p. 49</p>
<p>of the world, but that will be the resurrection of the righteous only.--Gen. 
  Rabba 96.</p>
<p>The general resurrection of the dead is appointed for the day of judgment, 
  and when it takes place the revived souls will sing angelic songs.--Midr. Eccles. 
  1.</p>
<p>The death of the righteous is even like the Day of Atonement, in that each 
  secures forgiveness for the sins of Israel.--Levit. Rabba 20.</p>
<p>A time has been appointed by God for the coming of Messiah. Yet if Israel but 
  repent his sins, the glorious redemption will be hastened, and Messiah will 
  make His appearance before the appointed time.--Exod. Rabba 25.</p>
<p>Great indeed will be the time of the approaching advent of Messiah. The wicked 
  will be trodden down as ashes under the feet of the righteous, the trees will 
  send forth their fragrance, and concerning the righteous it will be said, 'He 
  that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem shall be called holy.'</p>
<p>The seven years preceding the coming of the Son of David will be distinguished 
  by the following signs: The first year rain will be scarce and partial; in the 
  second year pangs of hunger will be felt; during the third year a severe famine 
  will be experienced, and many human beings will die; men of renown and piety 
  will perish, so that the Torah will be forgotten in Israel. This famine will 
  be the last of the ten predestined for the world; the other nine occurred during 
  the lives of Adam, Lemech, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Elijah, Elisha, the Judges, 
  and King David. The fourth year will be marked neither by famine nor by plenty, 
  but the fifth year will be one of prosperity, when the earth will bring forth 
  abundance. There will then be joy in all parts of the earth, and a revival of 
  study and knowledge of the Torah will be noticeable in the ranks of Israel. 
  The sixth year will be full of rumours of war, and the seventh year will see 
  the actual dread visitation of war. After all these signs have come to pass, 
  at the end of</p>
<p>p. 50</p>
<p>the seventh year, the Son of David will make His appearance. According to other 
  opinions, prior to the coming of Messiah the world will be terribly corrupt; 
  there will be no compassion amongst men, great derision and contempt for the 
  Torah and for piety will be universal, and truth will be almost unknown. Men 
  will be as shameless of their evil doings as the very animals, and the few righteous 
  who still exist will be in exceeding great distress. Persecution will be rife 
  everywhere, the youth will have no respect for the aged, so that the aged will 
  even rise before the presence of the young. The daughter will rebel against 
  her mother, and a man's worst enemies will be those of his own household. The 
  reigning powers will become infidel, and none will be found to raise his voice 
  in protest, so that mankind will seem to merit nought but extermination. If, 
  therefore, we behold the generations becoming ever more corrupt, there is therein 
  good reason to anticipate the advent of Messiah.--Midr. Song of Songs 2.</p>
<p>The ??? ('Zemach'), mentioned by Jeremiah (23. 5) and by Zechariah (6. 12) 
  is the Messiah.--Numb. Rabba 18.</p>
<p>Unlike the kings of this earth, God bestows some of His possessions and dignities 
  upon beings of flesh and blood. He set Solomon upon His own throne (1 Chron. 
  29. 23). He caused Elijah to ride upon His own horse; that is to say, upon the 
  storm and whirlwind. To Moses, He gave God's rod, and upon the head of Messiah 
  He placed His own crown.--Exod. Rabba 8. and Tanchuma Voera.</p>
<p>Many and varied are the things that in the Bible are designated 'the first.' 
  The month of the Egyptian exodus God named the first month of the year (Exod. 
  12. 2). He revealed Himself as 'the first' to the prophet Isaiah (44. 6). Zion, 
  too, is styled 'the first' (Jer. 117). Of Esau also the epithet is used (Gen. 
  25.) And, lastly, Messiah is mentioned as 'the first' (Isa. 41. 27).</p>
<p>p. 51</p>
<p>There is this intimate connexion between them, that God, who is the first, 
  will rebuild Zion the first, and bring retribution on Esau (= Rome), known as 
  the first, at the time of the advent of Messiah the first, in the month (= Nissan) 
  which was appointed as the first.--Exod. Rabba 15.</p>
<p>Five things brought about the redemption of the Israelites from Egypt: (1) 
  The sufferings of the people (2) their repentance; (3) the merits of their ancestors 
  (4) the expiration of the time fixed for their captivity (5) the mercy of their 
  God. These same causes will operate towards the realization of Israel's Messianic 
  hopes and lead to the last redemption through Messiah.--Deut. Rabba 2.</p>
<p>There will be a great difference between the Egyptian and the last redemption. 
  'When you were delivered from Egypt,' says God to Israel, 'you had to depart 
  in haste; at the last deliverance you shall not go in haste nor by Right, (Isa. 
  52. 12). At the Egyptian deliverance I, in my manifestation, went before you 
  (Exod. 13. 21). At the last deliverance 'the Lord will go before you and the 
  God of Israel will be your reward.' (Isa. 52. 12).--Exod. Rabba 19.</p>
<p>'All your former redemptions,' God says to Israel, have been accomplished through 
  the instrumentality of men, and were, consequently, not lasting in their effect. 
  You were delivered from Egypt through Moses and Aaron; you were rescued out 
  of the hands of Sisera by Deborah and Barak; from the power of Midian you were 
  saved by Shamgar. I myself will be your last and your everlasting Redeemer.'--Tanchuma 
  Achray.</p>
<p>Great chariots, precious stones and other valuable gifts will the nations bring 
  to Messiah. This means that the nations will bring Israel as a present to Messiah.--Midr. 
  Song of Songs 4.</p>
<p>Just as Judah, though not the eldest, had always</p>
<p>p. 52</p>
<p>precedence of Reuben and the other tribes (as is to be seen in various parts 
  of the Bible--Numbers 2. 3, 2. 9, 7. 12; Judges 1. 2, 20. 18), so he will have 
  precedence in announcing the coming of Messiah, as foretold by the prophet Nahum 
  (1. 15).--Numb. Rabba 2.</p>
<p>To Judah were revealed all the great men and what will happen to them from 
  the time of Jacob till the coming of Messiah.--Numb. Rabba 13.</p>
<p>The perpetual light in the Mishkan was typical of the light of King Messiah.--Levit. 
  Rabba 31.</p>
<p>All the gifts which Jacob felt himself constrained--out of fear--to present 
  to Esau, will be restored to Israel at the advent of Messiah.--Gen. Rabba 75.</p>
<p>Moses, the first redeemer, rode on an ass, gave the Israelites manna for food, 
  and brought up the water. So also shall Messiah be seen riding on an ass (Zech. 
  9), shall bring down manna from on high (Ps. 70. 16), and cause the rivers of 
  Judah to flow with water (Joel 4. 18).--Midr. Eccles. 1.</p>
<p>'The envy of Ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut 
  off' (Isa. 11. 13). That means that amongst the Jews themselves, at the time 
  of Messiah, there will be perfect peace and harmony.--Tanchuma Vayeegash.</p>
<p>There is no redemption without faith.--Tanchuma Beshallach.</p>
<p>Three things Israel despised, viz., the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of the 
  house of David, and the Temple, and God withholds His blessings from them till 
  they mend their ways in these things. That they will do so the prophet Hosea 
  (3. 5) tells us. 'Afterwards shall the children of Israel return and seek their 
  God' means that they will again accept the kingdom of heaven, 'and David their 
  king' obviously means the formerly rejected House of David, 'and shall fear 
  the Eternal and his goodness' refers to the Temple.--Midr. Samuel 13.</p>
<p>p. 53</p>
<p>Messiah will be asked which place He selects as His residence. His reply will 
  be, 'Need you ask Me? Surely Zion, my holy mountain.'--Midr. Samuel 19.</p>
<p>Amongst the various names of Messiah, who was born on the day on which the 
  Temple was destroyed, is that of ???? ?? ????? (Menachem ben Amiel) -Numb. Rabba 
  13.</p>
<p>The proper name of Messiah is ?? ????? (the Lord our righteousness).--Midr. 
  Lament. 1.</p>
<p>p. 54</p>
<p>IT is neither desirable nor consistent with the teachings of Judaism, or with 
  present day sentiment, to make attacks or adverse reflections on any religious 
  creed. But, while disclaiming any desire to provoke theological controversy, 
  or to accentuate religious differences, I should like to append a few observations 
  to this collection of excerpts from the Midrash on the subject of Messiah.</p>
<p>What impels me to do this is the existence of organizations for the conversion 
  of the Jews to Christianity, and the possibility of attempts being made to make 
  capital out of some of the Rabbinic passages which I have cited.</p>
<p>It has been my privilege to come into contact with many Christian clergymen, 
  both in England and in the Cape Colony, during more than forty years, and I 
  have reason to know, and am glad to acknowledge, that there could not be a body 
  of men more learned and pious, and more free from religious rancour and intolerance. 
  My own experience has abundantly proved that it is possible for sincere Jews 
  and Christians to associate on terms of friendship and mutual respect, and that 
  no friction need arise from their differences of opinion on certain matters, 
  But, at the same time, these differences do exist; and if a Jew refuses to adopt 
  Christianity on the strength of arguments drawn from Jewish writings, he must 
  be prepared to justify his attitude. I will therefore touch very briefly on 
  one or two of the</p>
<p>p. 55</p>
<p>arguments brought forward in support of the belief in Jesus as the Messiah.</p>
<p>The prophetic utterances which Christians quote as foreshadowing the coming 
  of Messiah are quoted repeatedly by the Rabbis, and, in my opinion, have been 
  largely borrowed by Christians from that source. These prophecies cannot be 
  assumed without further proof to refer to the founder of Christianity.</p>
<p>I do not wish to go into the question whether the term 'Messiah' means an epoch 
  of time or a personal Messiah--a matter on which Jews are by no means unanimous.</p>
<p>But it must be apparent to every thinking and unbiassed mind that not one of 
  the prophetic utterances and predictions or of the Midrashic sayings can apply 
  to the founder of Christianity any more than to the other numerous claimants 
  to the Messianic dignity who have appeared from time to time. Jesus of Nazareth, 
  no less than the other claimants, utterly failed to answer to the description 
  of the Messiah in the prophets, and to accomplish the work which the prophets 
  predicted.</p>
<p>One has but to glance at the present condition of the world--not the heathen, 
  but the Christian world--after more than nineteen hundred years from the supposed 
  advent of the Messiah; one has but to observe how anxious, for instance, nations 
  are to convert their Krupp guns into ploughshares and their machine guns into 
  pruning hooks. One has but, amongst very many other things, to consider the 
  peace on earth which now exists throughout the world! I would also remind those 
  who see in the name ?? ????? as applied to Messiah, a convincing proof of the 
  divinity of Jesus, that Jerusalem is also called ?? ????? (Jer. 33. 16). In 
  a similar way, the altar which Moses erected--in commemoration of his victory 
  over Amalek--he dignified by naming it ?? ??? (Exod. 17. 15).</p>
<p>And there is, in my humble opinion, amongst other</p>
<p>p. 56</p>
<p>arguments, one argument against the belief in Jesus as the Messiah, which is 
  unanswerable.</p>
<p>The Messiah, according to all who believe in a personal Messiah, Jews and Christians 
  alike, is to be a descendant of David. Now, according to Christianity, Jesus, 
  the son--though not the only son--of Mary, was the offspring of immaculate conception, 
  and had no earthly father from whom to take his pedigree. Even assuming that 
  (as some of my Christian friends assert, but without proof) Mary was a descendant 
  of David, that would not make Jesus a descendant, because pedigrees are reckoned 
  from the father's, and not the mother's, side. God being the Father of Jesus, 
  and God not being a descendant of King David, it follows that Jesus, His alleged 
  son, cannot be King David's descendant.</p>
<p>In support of my argument I may state that in the first four chapters of Numbers, 
  the words ???? ???? ???????? 'After their families by the house of their fathers,' 
  occur more than twenty times. There is not in the whole range of Holy Writ an 
  instance where we find a phrase repeated so many times in so short a space.</p>
<p>And this tends to show Moses' anxiety to impress us with the fact that descent 
  is to be reckoned on the father's side. On his father's side Jesus is not a 
  scion of David, and consequently he cannot be the Messiah.</p>
