    NEW WORLD ORDER &amp; ELITE THINK TANKS</b></p>

<p><b>Part one </b></p>
<p><b> The &#147;New World Order was announced in a keynote speech by President 
  George Bush on the eve of the Gulf War. Meant to signify US success in combining 
  the military forces of numerous nations to &#147;police&#148; future global 
  flare-ups &#150; beginning with Iraq &#150; a far darker purpose remained unstated. 
  SITTING AT THE CORE OF THE NWO IS ANOTHER, MORE SINISTER GOAL: THE POLITICAL 
  AND ECONOMIC DOMINANCE OF THE GLOBE BY AN IMMENSELY POWERFUL BUSINESS ELITE. 
  </b></p>
<p><b> Lurking behind and controlling the emerging world government is a small 
  handful of influential men and women who &#150; like the Gods on Mount Olympus 
  &#150; consider it their birthright to dominate mankind. Those who form this 
  cabal operate in a network of shadowy organisations that proselytise the demise 
  of western democracy. IN ITS PLACE THEY PLAN TO SUBSTITUTE AN AUTHORITARIAN 
  REGIME THAT BEFITS THE FEW TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE MANY. </b></p>
<p><b> Central to their plans is the creeping disempowerment of elected national 
  governments. Key domestic political policies including foreign, defence and 
  economic portfolio&#146;s will be subtly transferred to the hands of unelected 
  &#147;supra-national&#148; bodies already under their sway. What remains of 
  a nations governing structure will be used for routine administrative matters 
  at a local level. </b></p>
<p><b> These moves are designed to commandeer the planet&#146;s resources, wealth 
  and output. A world army will suppress any nation that resists. Organisations 
  like the United Nations and the European Union are just two of the platforms 
  used to bring these plans to fruition. At least this is the view of numerous 
  independent observers who say they - and you - are being robbed of any meaningful 
  say in the future shape of things to come. </b></p>
<p><b> To support their scenario, critic&#146;s point to a small number of influential, 
  and inter-locking groups, that develop and implement global policy behind the 
  scenes. Often formed in secrecy they operate as closed clubs where membership 
  is by invitation only. The mainstream media, who are heavily represented in 
  each of them, refuse to publish stories inimical to their long-term goals &#150; 
  aimed A GLOBAL COUP D'ETAT. </b></p>
<p><b> Of many such forums, the Bilderberg group is considered the pre-eminent 
  &#147;parallel government&#148; that secretly sets the political and economic 
  agenda of the European Union. Composed of 120 of the world&#146;s most powerful 
  and influential men and women &#150; including heads of state, cabinet ranked 
  politicians, royalty, leading industrialists, financiers, academics and media-people 
  , they meet in secret each year. Here they manipulate events and clandestinely 
  plan the election of the next President or Prime Minister. Nominees for these 
  positions must give de facto loyalty to their hidden masters. </b></p>
<p><b> Named after the Hotel in Osterbeek, Holland, where the first meeting took 
  place in May 1954, &#147;Bilderbergers&#148; &#150; as they are known - are 
  forbidden to speak openly of their discussions and the decisions they reach. 
  Delegates are drawn from the US, Canada and Europe &#150; with Europe sharing 
  approximately two-thirds representation. Meetings are held for three days every 
  year &#150; in late May and early June - where &#147;informal&#148; discussions 
  of &#147;current concern&#148; are tabled. </b></p>
<p><b> The names of those attending Bilderberg meetings reads like a compact version 
  of &#147;Who&#146;s Who:&#148; Lord Peter Carrington, former Foreign Secretary 
  and Secretary General of NATO; Conrad Black, Chairman of Telegraph Newspapers 
  Plc; Henry Kissinger, former US Secretary of State and Chairman, Kissinger Associates 
  Inc; David Rockerfeller, Chairman, Chase Manhattan Bank; James Wolfensohn, President, 
  the World Bank; Lloyd Bentsen, former US Treasury Secretary; John Brown, Group 
  CEO, British Petroleum; William McDonough, President, Federal Reserve Bank of 
  New York; Colin Powell, former Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff; Simon Robertson, 
  former Chairman Kleinwort Benson group Plc; Peter Sutherland, former Director 
  general of GATT and WTO. These are just some of the &#147;mover&#146;s and shaker&#146;s&#148; 
  who attended the 1997 meeting. </b></p>
<p><b> Their meetings are subject to massive security and utmost secrecy. The 
  1995 convention occurred in a mountain top retreat at Burgenstock, Switzerland. 
  Attendees arrived and departed by helicopter. The 100 plus delegates exclusively 
  occupied three luxury hotels and were ferociously protected by the Swiss Army, 
  police and intelligence personnel. In addition, the Bilderberg group has its 
  own private security force that boasts a number of snarling attack dogs. Members 
  of the public who are resident in the hotels are brusquely moved out a day prior 
  to the arrival of the great and the good. </b></p>
<p><b> The locations chosen for these elite shindigs change each year. Last year&#146;s 
  forum was held at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce leadership Centre, 
  King City, on the outskirts of Toronto. The &#147;CICB Centre&#148; is known 
  as Canada&#146;s &#147;Bohemian Grove&#148; - named after the exclusive retreat 
  in California, which hosts a luxurious meeting each year for the rich, famous 
  and influential to relax and socialise with their peers. What few reports are 
  available of the annual Bohemian Grove get-together, tell of strange, nocturnal 
  Masonic rituals being performed in front of roaring campfires. Over the years 
  numerous former US Presidents has attended &#147;Grove&#148; gatherings. </b></p>
<p><b> This year&#146;s Bilderberg meeting &#150; the 45th annual event - took 
  place at the lush Renaissance Pine Isle Resort, Lake Lanier island, Georgia, 
  USA. A flying visit by Hilary Clinton, America&#146;s &#147;first lady&#148; 
  set the tone for subsequent discussions. Topics included modifying the public 
  mind to accept &#147;a world without borders&#148; &#150; and expanding NATO 
  to include former Warsaw Pact nations. Dr. Henry Kissinger, former US Secretary 
  of State, said that NATO had become &#147;The United Nations world army&#148; 
  &#150; according to a report published by The Spotlight, a populist American 
  newspaper that single-handedly covers these events. Kissinger, The Spotlight 
  reported, went on to add this achievement occurred &#147;when American troops 
  wore blue helmets in Bosnia, serving under a European commander who reported 
  directly to the U.N. Security Council, with the President and Congress having 
  no voice.&#148; </b></p>
<p><b> Other subjects discussed included ways of improving the group&#146;s secrecy, 
  possibly by a change of name and &#147;fast-tracking austerity measures and 
  the EMU.&#148; Also on the agenda were methods of &#147;extending the influence 
  of Transnational Corporations and banks over Western politicians,&#148; according 
  to Tony Gosling a Bilderberger watcher. &#147;Austerity&#148; is packaged under 
  various PR rubrics designed to sanitise the impending upheaval on ordinary mortals. 
  The end result, however, is that money flows from the public&#146;s pocket to 
  theirs. With it also goes the ability for the man in the street to define their 
  own destiny. </b></p>
<p><b> Apart from a permanent &#147;Steering Committee&#148; of top-notch kingmakers, 
  delegates are selected according to merit. There is no formal membership list. 
  Britain&#146;s Prime Minister, Tony Blair, attended the 1993 meeting. The 1997 
  meeting saw former Pentagon Chief of Staff Colin Powell, as a keynote speaker. 
  His presence is said to signal his &#147;anointment&#148; as the future US president. 
  Prior to his election, President Bill Clinton attended the 1991 meeting at Baden-Baden 
  in Germany. Until then Clinton remained an obscure state governor unknown by 
  the vast majority of Americans. </b></p>
<p><b> Yet as influential as it is, Bilderberg is just one of several inter-connected 
  special interest groups that reign as de facto secret governments. Between them 
  they wield massive, but clandestine clout. In the United States the Trilateral 
  Commission sits at the forefront. The &#147;Commission&#148; is a &#147;sister&#148; 
  organisation of Bilderberg - and has an interlocking leadership as well as sharing 
  a common agenda. </b></p>
<p><b> Formed in 1972 at the estate of multi-billionaire, David Rockerfeller, 
  a seventeen man &#147;planning group&#148; was formed to launch the Commission 
  on to an unsuspecting world. Backed with Rockerfeller money, Zbigniew Brzezinski 
  - then a professor at Columbia University - was chosen as Chairman. Some years 
  earlier, Brzezinski called for &#147;a community of the developed nations&#148; 
  to be formed. Drawn from America, Western Europe and Japan &#150; this community, 
  which he typified as the most &#147;advanced in planetary consciousness&#148; 
  as a result of their &#147;scientific and technological innovation,&#148; was 
  destined to rule the planet. Brzezinski&#146;s stated in his book &#147;Between 
  Two Ages,&#148; that &#147;National sovereignty is no longer a viable concept&#148; 
  - a trumpet signal of elite plans aimed at removing national borders and identities. 
  </b></p>
<p><b> By 1973, Jimmy Carter, till then a unknown hayseed from Georgia, had aligned 
  himself with the Trilateral Commission, becoming a founding member. Three years 
  later, in 1976, he was elected President and immediately commenced policies 
  sanctioned by the Commission. Numerous members of his administration were also 
  fellow members. None more so, than Brzezinski, who was placed in the enormously 
  powerful National Security Adviser slot. </b></p>
<p><b> Critics, among them Senator Barry Goldwater, referred to the Commission 
  as &#147;David Rockerfeller&#146;s newest international cabal.&#148; Goldwater 
  then added &#147;it is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation 
  of the commercial and banking interests&#133;&#148; Goldwater&#146;s comments 
  revealed the true-working of how President&#146;s are made and elections won. 
  </b></p>
<p><b> In his book &#147;With No Apologies,&#148; Goldwater states &#147;David 
  Rockerfeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski found Jimmy Carter to be their ideal candidate. 
  They helped him win the nomination and the presidency. To accomplish this purpose, 
  they mobilised the money power of the Wall Street bankers, the intellectual 
  influence of the academic community &#150; which is subservient to the wealth 
  of the great tax-exempt foundations &#150; and the media controllers represented 
  in the membership of the CFR and the Trilateral.&#148; </b></p>
<p><b> Disparaging democracy as unworkable, the Trilateralists proceeded to plan 
  the carve up the globe into three principal and inter-related powers. These 
  would be the United States of the America&#146;s, the United States of Europe 
  and a Pacific Union. Big business, and especially trans national corporations 
  would become the effective masters of the world. </b></p>
<p><b> Embedded even deeper inside US domestic politics is the Council for Foreign 
  Relations, known as the &#147;CFR.&#148; With a membership roster running into 
  the thousands &#150; and selected from all disciplines - it is the real creator 
  of US foreign policy. In fact, since 1940, every US Secretary of State bar one, 
  has been a member of the CFR or it&#146;s younger brother the Trilateral Commission. 
  Likewise every single Secretary of Defense (and before that Secretaries of War) 
  have been members. Key Directors of Central Intelligence and almost every major 
  US National Security Advisors have been drawn from the Council. Over the years 
  it has grown to dominate White House appointments. </b></p>
<p><b> Today, President Clinton, in addition to having attended a Bilderberg meeting, 
  also has membership in the CFR and the TC. His administration is staffed by 
  almost one hundred CFR members. Before him President George Bush appointed no 
  less than 95 CFRer&#146;s to positions of political power. Such is the dominance 
  of these &#147;elite managers&#148; that listing the names and titles of members 
  who have served in the last four US administrations runs to a staggering 10 
  close-typed pages. </b></p>
<p><b> Whereas these and other organisations are likened to the visible arm of 
  the global elite, the &#147;inner sanctuary&#148; is the sinister &#147;Order 
  of the Skull and Bones.&#148; Immensely secretive, even to this day, the Skull 
  and Bones lay at the pinnacle of absolute hidden power from which they direct 
  World Inc. Formed over a century and a half ago, its origin dates back to the 
  German Illuminati - a secret occult society whose agenda has always been global 
  dominance. </b></p>
<p><b> The membership roster is a well-guarded secret although names do occasionally 
  surface &#150; including that of former President, George Bush. &#147;Bonesmen&#148; 
  are forbidden from speaking of the bizarre Satanic rituals they practise. However, 
  they are believed to worship death &#150; and use as their symbol the &#147;death&#146;s 
  head&#148; emblem also worn by SS storm-troopers during WW11. </b></p>
<p><b> As we probe deeper into the &#147;Order&#148; and unravel the connections 
  of their British associates, we discover that there is nothing &#147;new&#148; 
  about the New World Order. In fact it dates back hundreds and possibly thousands 
  of years. Along the way, history has deftly manipulated to eclipse the presence 
  of those who create wars to further their occult aims. </b></p>
<p><b>An insider&#146;s account of the NWO elite </b></p>
<p> <b>&#147;The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, 
  nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands 
  able to dominate the political system and the economy of the world as a whole.&#148; 
  These revealing words were written by Dr. Carrol Quigley. An eminently respectable 
  academic, he was granted access to secret records and archives that revealed 
  the workings of the group in his book &#147;Tragedy &amp; Hope.&#148; In his 
  expose he explains how the one world system &#147;was to be controlled in a 
  feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret 
  agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b> Bilderberg and press censorship </b></p>
<p><b> In his 6 May 1975, &#147;Lombard&#148; column of the Financial Times, journalist 
  C. Gordon Tether published a critical account of the Bilderberg group. Saying 
  &#147;if the Bilderberg Group is not a conspiracy of some sort, it is conducted 
  in such a way as to give a remarkably good imitation of one,&#148; Tether was 
  never again permitted to mention the secretive group. After a protracted censorship 
  battle with the editorial management, he was sacked a year later. Other journalists 
  were not slow to comprehend the significance of Tether&#146;s critical &#147;mistake.&#148; 
  Amongst many British media icons who have attended Bilderberg are Sir William 
  Rees-Mogg; Andrew Knight and Frank Giles. </b></p>
<p><b> MI6 pushes Britain to join the European Union </b></p>
<p><b> The Sunday Telegraph in its issue dated 27 April 1997, published a telling 
  story about how Britain&#146;s politicians had been pushed into joining the 
  fledgling EEC &#150; forerunner of the EU - by the Secret Intelligence Service. 
  A secretly funded unit of the Foreign Office linked to MI6 used public funds 
  to initiate a covert propaganda drive aimed at convincing Britain to join the 
  EEC. The campaign is said to have been backed by the CIA. As Prime Minister, 
  pro European Ted Heath &#150; an early Bilderberg attendee - was experiencing 
  an up-hill struggle to convince the public and rebel politicians to support 
  the move. Following a massive media campaign voters decided in favour. </b></p>
