  WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING US DIE</font></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">APRIL 12:..The World Stands Together 
    Against War</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the face of Iraqi resistance 
    to the invasion, the U.S. military strategy has abruptly shifted in the last 
    few days. Instead of posing as liberators, the U.S. high command has called 
    for open warfare against the Iraqi civilian population. In the last 48 hours, 
    hundreds of civilians have been shot down on the roadways, in their homes, 
    on their farms. The aerial bombings are becoming more indiscriminate as missiles 
    land in markets and residential neighborhoods.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Iraq war has suddenly taken 
    on the worst features of the U.S. war in Vietnam. Facing a defiant and resisting 
    population, U.S. troops, under the direction of their officers, treat all 
    members of the population as suspect and decide to shoot first and ask questions 
    later. The U.S. soldiers have been lied to about their mission. They have 
    been sent to kill and be killed in a war for empire and conquest, not liberation. 
    U.S. casualties are mounting in this war that need not have happened.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On March 31, there was a massacre 
    of civilians, mainly women and their children, whose crime was that they were 
    driving on a roadway in their own country. As their van approached a checkpoint, 
    U.S. soldiers destroyed their vehicle with a barrage of 25mm cannon fire from 
    one or more of their M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The Washington Post quoted 
    Capt. Ronny Johnson of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division in his series of orders 
    to the troops present:<br>
    - &quot;Fire a warning shot&quot;<br>
    - &quot;Stop [messing] around!&quot;<br>
    - &quot;Stop him, Red 1, stop him!&quot;<br>
    - &quot;Cease fire!&quot;<br>
    - &quot;You just [expletive] killed a family because you didn't <br>
    fire a warning shot soon enough!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;shoot first &shy; ask 
    questions later&quot; strategy is not the result of spontaneous actions by 
    scared and edgy troops. These are orders given the troops from the Pentagon 
    high command.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Everyone is now seen as a 
    combatant until proven otherwise,&quot; a Pentagon official is quoted in the 
    Washington Post of April 1, 2003. The Pentagon recognizes that the shift in 
    tactics will be understood as a brutal escalation of force against the civilian 
    population and that their earlier posture as &quot;liberators&quot; will be 
    exposed. &quot;You'll see acts of kindness, medical care and the like, but 
    the large scale aid effort will have to wait,&quot; a Pentagon official told 
    the Washington Post. In fact the new US strategy now is deliberately preventing 
    Iraqi civilians in Nassiriya and other towns from receiving food and water 
    unless they cooperate with the occupation forces.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">US Marine Operations Commander 
    Lt. Colonel Paul Roche told reporters on March 31 that the US strategy towards 
    the people of the city of Nassiriya included the use of food and water as 
    a weapon to terrorize and break the will of the civilian population.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the April 1 front page of the 
    Washington Post, the Pentagon's new strategy is euphemistically referred to 
    in the headline &quot;US troops instructed to use tougher tactics.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The assault against civilians is 
    being reported in greater detail and honesty by the world media outside the 
    United States. This change in US tactics is, as the following report shows, 
    encouraging the most racist and homicidal tendencies among US soldiers at 
    the front. It is important to read the following passage from the UK Times 
    of Sunday, March 30. It reports of a gruesome scene outside of Nassiriya. 
    Some fifteen vehicles, including a minivan and a couple of trucks, were found 
    destroyed and riddled with bullets by the Times UK reporter Mark Franchetti:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Amid the wreckage I counted 
    12 dead civilians, lying in the road or in nearby ditches. All had been trying 
    to leave this southern town overnight, probably for fear of being killed by 
    US helicopter attacks and heavy artillery. &quot;Their mistake had been to 
    flee over a bridge that is crucial to the coalition's supply lines and to 
    run into a group of shell-shocked young American marines with orders to shoot 
    anything that moved.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;One man's body was still 
    in flames. It gave out a hissing sound. Tucked away in his breast pocket, 
    thick wads of banknotes were turning to ashes. His savings, perhaps. &quot;Down 
    the road, a little girl, no older than five and dressed in a pretty orange 
    and gold dress, lay dead in a ditch next to the body of a man who may have 
    been her father. Half his head was missing. &quot;Nearby, in a battered old 
    Volga, peppered with ammunition holes, an Iraqi woman - perhaps the girl's 
    mother - was dead, slumped in the back seat. A US Abrams tank nicknamed Ghetto 
    Fabulous drove past the bodies. &quot;This was not the only family who had 
    taken what they thought was a last chance for safety. A father, baby girl 
    and boy lay in a shallow grave. On the bridge itself a dead Iraqi civilian 
    lay next to the carcass of a donkey.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The UK Times article also documents 
    that in Iraq, just as in Vietnam, the US soldiers are being trained to wage 
    war against a civilian population by dehumanizing those whom they are killing. 
    &quot;I'll Just Kill Him&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As I walked away, Lieutenant 
    Matt Martin, whose third child, Isabella, was born while he was on board ship 
    en route to the Gulf, appeared beside me. &quot; 'Did you see all that?' he 
    asked, his eyes filled with tears. 'Did you see that little baby girl? I carried 
    her body and buried it as best I could but I had no time. It really gets to 
    me to see children being killed like this, but we had no choice.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Martin's distress was in 
    contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some of his fellow marines as they 
    surveyed the scene. 'The Iraqis are sick people and we are the chemotherapy,' 
    said Corporal Ryan Dupre. 'I am starting to hate this country. Wait till I 
    get hold of a friggin' Iraqi. No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill 
    him.' &quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Crimes Against Humanity</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George Bush and the high command 
    are guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes. What we are witnessing 
    is a full-scale massacre carried out from the land, the air and the sea assault. 
    The US media presents the war as carefully packaged propaganda and trivializes 
    the actual human costs of the war by turning it into something of a spectator 
    sport. But the Iraqi people cannot escape this war and they cannot turn off 
    their television to make it go away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, it is the non-U.S. press 
    that reveals the extent of the criminality of the war. A March 29 Reuters 
    article entitled &quot;Iraqis Delirious with Grief After Missile Attack&quot; 
    described the Friday night attack by US bombs in a poor section of Baghdad. 
    Arouba Khodeir, 39, while &quot;wailing hysterically and hitting herself in 
    the face and chest, as women around her were trying to calm her down,&quot; 
    spoke of her 11-year-old son Karar who died outside the house with his friends: 
    &quot; 'My son had his head blown off,' screamed Khodeir. 'Why are they hitting 
    the people? Why are they killing the children? Why are they doing his to us? 
    Why are they attacking civilians? Didn't Bush say on TV that he won't attack 
    civilians. But these people who died are all civilians? Is this a target?' 
    she wailed, pointing at the dried blood of her son still splashed on the walls.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Whole World is Watching 
    Us Die&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report also described the killing 
    of Shaza Shallum, 20, who was &quot;holding her baby and walking with two 
    relatives when the explosion sent a shard of shrapnel through her neck. Six-month-old 
    Fatma was found alive in her dead mother's arms and brought by neighbors to 
    her grandmother. The wails of the mourners drowned the cries of the hungry 
    infant.&quot; One of the people living in this neighborhood told Reuters: 
    &quot;We are helpless people. It is all out of our hands. WHY CANNOT THE WORLD 
    FIND A SOLUTION? The whole world is watching us die and is doing nothing to 
    help us.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On April 12, people of conscience 
    all over the world are marching, rallying, and carrying out massive protests 
    in solidarity with the suffering people of Iraq. The people who are being 
    killed are not our enemies, they are our sisters and brothers. They must not 
    be allowed to think that the world is &quot;doing nothing&quot; as the violence 
    is inflicted upon them. Thousands of young men and women in the US armed forces 
    either oppose the war or are going through a process of questioning about 
    the mission. It is crucial that the people of the United States come together 
    to demand: Stop the War Against Iraq / Bring the Troops Home Now.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The National March to Stop the 
    War on Iraq comes in the <br>
    midst of the long-planned Latin America Solidarity <br>
    Coalition (LASC) Mobilization Against Military and <br>
    Economic Intervention in Latin America and the Caribbean. <br>
    A.N.S.W.E.R. encourages participation in the LASC public <br>
    plenaries including major Latin American speakers on <br>
    Friday and Saturday at 7:00pm and the LASC rally and <br>

<p><font size="+1">There are those in the world who have no thoughts about God 
  one way or the other. There are those who believe and are perplexed. There are 
  those who might say that this is not one of God's finest hours. There are those 
  in the world who have nothing but disdain for the very idea of God itself, and 
  believe that they themselves (as thirsty for peace, and as hungry for justice 
  in the earth as they may be), are wholly capable of altering the course of human 
  history (as if history was not at this moment coming to its own foreordained 
  conclusions--as if the kingdom of the Great Beast--the Great Colossus of Daniel, 
  chapter 2--was not now standing astride the earth just as it was seen in visions 
  over two thousand years ago...But I rather suspect that it is <i>religion</i>, 
  and all of its failings, that is being rejected and not God). Thousands are 
  raising their fists, shouting slogans and beating the air. They rise up (as 
  well the world should, given all that is happening in the earth at this moment. 
  And God bless A.N.S.W.E.R. and others for standing in the breech and reporting 
  these things)...but then what? (I wish that I did not find myself at odds with 
  the intellectuals and others on the political Left--I stand in awe when I see 
  Amy Goodman courageously reporting the <i>real</i> news, or Howard Zinn and 
  others of his righteous character presenting their alternative viewpoints on 
  freespeech television--maybe it is just). Many behave as if their disdain, or 
  even indifference to God (their purely political reasonings), can catch the 
  Wind and carry the people from one side of this present world-crisis to the 
  other. They do not understand the nature of the crisis, how it is fed, how all 
  things are interconnected, or what is unfolding, and continue to propose purely 
  political solutions to purely spiritual matters. The world has had enough of 
  politics, of business as usual. (Isaiah 59). It is yearning for a spiritual 
  solution--the final synthesis. Listen instead to the silence. The world is poised. 
  It is waiting for something to happen, something truly momentous...something 
  that cannot happen anywhere else on earth than America. (Isaiah 66:6-17).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And there are those who believe that God is only <i>good</i>, 
  and has nothing whatsoever to do with <i>evil</i> and destruction in the world--with 
  the things that are unfolding before our very eyes. Such childish notions fail 
  to account for all that the scriptures actually say about God, and about the 
  great historical vortex through which the whole world is now passing. Others 
  have labored heavily about these things; they have striven both with God and 
  with those of their own generation. They have also seen the innocent of the 
  earth suffering for the guilty, but they realize the presence of God itself 
  in all these things, and understand exactly why the Christ-spirit has, and must 
  come into the world. The indictment against the sons of Darkness, the capitalists 
  and warriors of the Western world, is clear. They have violated the Law. The 
  time of cleansing has come. It is God's time to cast in the sickle (Joel, chapters 
  2 and 3. KJV). Oppression and injustice in all of its forms, authoritarianism 
  in all of its forms, the commission of war, indeed, the very Darkness itself 
  is about to be swept away in the ensuing flood of human events:</font></p>

    hidden meanings of things, but divert themselves instead with all kinds of 
    iniquitous arcane lore&#133;They do not know the hidden meaning of what is 
    actually taking place, nor have they ever understood the lessons of the past. 
    Consequently, they have no knowledge of what is coming upon them, and have 
    done nothing to save their souls from the deeper implications of present events. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This, however, will symbolize things 
    for you. What is going to happen is, as it were, that all iniquity is going

    to depart before Right, as darkness departs before light. As smoke disappears 
    and is no more, so will Wrong disappear forever. But Right will be revealed 
    like the Sun. The world will rest on the sound Foundation. All who cling to 
    rarified arcane lore will cease to exist. The world will be filled with knowledge, 
    and ignorance exist no more. </font></p>

    not the praises of truth sung by all nations? Yet is there a single race or 
    tribe that really adheres to it? What nation like to be oppressed by a stronger 
    power? Or who wants his property plundered unjustly? Yet, is there a single 
    nation that has not oppressed its neighbor? Or where in the world will you 
    find a people that has not plundered the property of another?&quot; </font>The

  Grows Out Of &quot;The Vision Thing&quot;</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON__It wasn't &quot;the 
    economy, stupid.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Democrats who hoped the 2002 election 
    would tilt in their favor because of the sputtering economy were dreaming. 
    It's not 1992. George W. Bush is not his father, and Democrats lack a national 
    figure with the persuasive qualities of the early President Clinton...THIS 
    ELECTION WAS ABOUT GEORGE W. BUSH AND FEELING GOOD ABOUT AMERICA. IT WAS ABOUT 
    SOMETHING AS BASIC AND CORNY AS HOPE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush beat the midterm curse and 
    gained seats in the House and control of the Senate because he and his political 
    guru, Karl Rove, brilliantly realized something the first President Bush dismissed 
    as &quot;THE VISION THING.&quot; This year vision was more important than 
    ever.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">America's optimistic spirit has 
    been tested the past two years. We have been through a lot since the 36-day 
    Florida recount after the 2000 election--terrorism, war, plummeting 401(k) 
    plan balances, killer mosquitos, snipers. </font>(Understand 1 Thessalonians 
    5)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Starting Labor Day, Bush put on 
    a rolling pep rally--for America. As he appeared on stage with dozens of Republican 
    candidates, Bush championed such traditional American ideals as fairness, 
    faith and freedom. </font>(Each a biblical concept, which is why he has the 
    support to carry on his global wars of aggression )<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The candidates themselves became almost interchangeable as Bush praised each 
    for his devotion to family and country and his support of Bush's agenda.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Nov.5, Bush won the big game. 
    Nobody saw the Republican sweep coming, because analysts didn't reckon on 
    the impact Bush's patriotic rhetoric </font>(his religious and biblical rhetoric)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    would have in close races around the country. Campaigns are supposed to be 
    about which party will better handle war with Iraq, not what it meant to be 
    an American.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even if Democrats had come up with 
    a snappy five-point plan to fix the economy, they probably couldn't have prevailed 
    against Bush's sunny patriotic message about America's future. Like President 
    Reagan, Bush communicated personal values. He touched the policy bases in 
    his stump speech, but he also never missed an opportunity to say how badly 
    the terrorists misread America or how much good has come from the evil of 
    Sept.11. </font>(Isaiah 5:11-25; 30:25; Romans 13; John 16:7-15, KJV)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unabashedly upbeat, he vowed the 
    future will be better than the past for everyone. He said he understands America. 
    &quot;We're the finest, full of the greatest people on the face of the Earth,&quot; 
    he said, without a trace of embarrassment. Let others worry about jingoism 
    or how the world reacts. He evoked THE POWER OF LOVE and urged the people 
    to put their arms around a neighbor (Of course he stole these sentiments directly 
    out of the values of the 60s, which he in every other way detested). SERVE 
    A HIGHER PURPOSE THAN SELF-INTEREST HE SAID. </font></p>

    but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest 
    solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of king that shall reign over 
    them.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people 
    that asked of him a king.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he said, This will be the manner of the king that 
    shall reign over you. He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, 
    for his chariots, and to be his horsemen </font></i>(one can use their imagination)<i><font size="+1">, 
    and some shall run before his chariots.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he will appoint him captains over thousands </font></i>(mayors 
    of town and cities)<i><font size="+1">, and captains over fifties </font></i>(governors 
    of states)<i><font size="+1">; and will set them to ear his ground, and to 
    reap his harvest </font></i>(think not only of American Agribusiness but of 
    the entire American educational system. See the chapter entitled Education 
    and the Second Wave)<i><font size="+1">, and to make his instruments of war, 
    and instruments of his chariots.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, 
    and to be cooks, and to be bakers. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and 
    your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he will take the tenth of your seed </font></i>(the 
    tithe that belongs to God)<i><font size="+1">, and of your vineyards, and 
    give to his officers, and to his servants.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, 
    and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">He will take the tenth of your sheep, and ye shall be 
    his servants.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king 
    which ye have chosen you: and the Lord will not hear you in that day. </font></i>(God 
    is nevertheless risen up, not on behalf of those who would not have Him rule 
    over them, but against them on behalf of the poor and the oppressed of the 
    earth...1 Samuel 2:1-10)<i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel: 
    and they said, Nay, we will have a king over us;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">That we also may be like all the nations; and that our 
    king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Samuel 8:7-20).</font></p>
