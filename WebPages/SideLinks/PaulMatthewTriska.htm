  <p align="left"><font size="+1">The cry of Rachel weeping for her children pierced 
    our souls this day. Our beloved Paul (our own Paul), left his apartment about 
    3 this morning, drove the long winding, lonely road out to the firing range 
    near Beech Fork in Wayne County and beneath the dark, star-filled sky, killed 
    himself. He shot himself in the head with a breech loading rifle. &quot;What? 
    Dead? Who? Paul? What? NO! Not Paul, Not Paul!&quot; she cried as she fled 
    from the news that Paul was dead. &quot;Officer are you certain that it's 
    Paul?&quot; &quot;Yes, I am sorry.&quot; &quot;Suicide! are you certain that 
    it was suicide?&quot; &quot;Yes, the investigating officers are almost completely 
    certain that it was...&quot; The lamentation, the weeping, the sobbing, heart 
    wracking pain, began. And then the soul searching...the questioning. &quot;How 
    could this have happened?&quot; &quot;Why didn't we see it coming?' &quot;Why 
    didn't we do something...When? What could we have done that we didn't? Why?&quot; 
    This can not be happening. It is too surreal...Where? where is the Light in 
    all of this? where was Love? It was everywhere, yet... yet still...</font></p>

    <pre>I have never felt so final   
torment and blistering pain in my subconscious 
killing everything that is in me
tearing my flesh, inhale to (blemish) the mind
Still no coercion of my torture
My sickness only festers, I am rendered lifeless
Incapable of emotions and impassive to all
no words portray my own fallacy
I am forsaken here in this world of bliss.
Where I am left tasteless
I would give anything for some peace of mind
one minute ray of light is all I ask of my supposed savior
my destitution of this allows no way to heal
desperately trying to hold on to anything.
In this I have never felt so final. 


                                       PERPLEXITY


A perplexity of pain runs deeply through me.
Just another relapse in my mind's torture.
Nothing to me I keep, no touch tasted.
(Torn) consciousness, for reality is too hard.
A perplexity of pain runs deeply through me.
My duplicity is plainly displayed, yet it lies unseen.
Mind's disease is the callous(ness), My way of not feeling
I don't feed from lust's nourishment
I can't take, for I only ingest the blood and return more to 'its' ( ? )
In life, needed only someone. This is a flower,
dark and lost in shadows of me.
Still no light on my discontent. A glimpse reminds me of my hurt.
Feel so hollow while nothing I touch
A perplexity of pain runs deeply through me.

With no one I share
Clouded
Insides
Tear
End of all

  <p><font size="+1">These words and others like them (it is so heartbreaking 
    to read them now), were among Paul's possessions. Who knew? Who <i>really</i> 
    knew? Who really understood the depths of Paul's depression? He kept it mostly 
    hidden, covered up in so many ways, under his laughter (Paul kept everyone 
    in stitches at times), in his witty cynicism and his intellectual musings. 
    He had us disarmed in so many ways. He was bright and I guess we just took 
    for granted his abilities to carry on with the rest of us, with his sisters 
    and his cousins who he loved, and who dearly loved Paul in return. We knew 
    he was sad about many things (for reasons that all come home to us now), and 
    had conflicts with the world (his world--the world of his youthful imagination), 
    but we were on a common journey through this great wilderness--through the 
    oppressions and despair of these times--and our thoughts for God and each 
    other were going to carry all of us through....(The <i>Accuser</i> could find 
    a place among us here, if we allowed ourselves to believe that God has abandoned 
    us...No, nothing has changed, only the way we imagined it would turn out. 
    In searching our own souls now, as well as that part of Paul's that laid so 
    hidden, as we see it in the spiritual context of both our times and our own 
    personal lives, as a community and a family, it comes clearer. We will not 
    spare ourselves the meanings and the lessons to be learned here but we will 
    not abandon the faith we started out with. We will search our hearts and scour 
    our souls, not only for ourselves but for families everywhere who are suffering 
    the same effects of these times upon their lives--the same which have suddenly 
    overtaken us. God never promised to spare us these afflictions [others perhaps, 
    but not us, not in this age], but did provide the way of transforming our 
    Darkness into Light. As we have always looked for the Light in the darkness 
    and despair of our times we will look for the Light in all of this)...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">&quot;What would you like us to do with Paul's body?' the 
    officer asked. &quot;We will need a little time, can He be brought to the 
    morgue at St. Mary's?&quot; &quot;Yes, I think we can arrange that,&quot; 
    he said. (It was nice to meet a police officer with a humble concern and respect 
    for the lives he was touching). In the midst of all the sorrow and pain there 
    were things to be done, other arrangements to be made, and a grave to be dug. 
    (We are reminded at these times how disconnected we have become from the sacred 
    rhythms of Life--from the meaning of Life itself--and from the great mysterious 
    cycle of birth and death that governs the universe. Others, <i>professionals</i> 
    you know, take care of those things for us. They deliver our children, teach 
    our young, grow our food, direct our lives and finally speak the words and 
    bury our dead. But when did this happen? Was it when the doctors, the priests 
    and professionals first forsook us? when they moved to the other side of town? 
    I think so; and when we ourselves tried to follow them, forsaking <i>each 
    other</i> as a community, and abandoning Nature for the grosser material illusions--the 
    things, and the creeping pleasures--of the modern world. Perhaps we are only 
    now, in the whole history of man, becoming truly conscious of it all, of our 
    relationship to the Divine in each other, and to the Divine in Nature now 
    that we have lost it. We take refuge in Her now as we repair once again to 
    the beautiful old woods where Bob and Betty and their family live, where Paul's 
    grandmother is already buried beneath the family Tree. Our friends have so 
    graciously allowed us to bury our dead next to theirs. It is the Queen cemetery, 
    and Betty's parents and grandparents are buried there, beneath a giant oak. 
    We went out in the morning with shovels and mattocks to begin the healing 
    process, to open the earth with our own hands, to stare into the gaping wound 
    that has opened in all of our hearts...</font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Paul%27sUncle.jpg" width="306" height="225"></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Paul's (Dad).</b></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">...and then to close it back up again on the 
    morrow as Paul's remains are laid to rest, when everyone, young and old alike, 
    can experience in their own most intimate way the drama of death, and imagine 
    for themselves the mystery of resurrection again on some other plane of existence. 
    (It is so essential for people, and children in particular, to have their 
    own rituals back in their own hands). As we were opening the grave Paul's 
    friend James said, &quot;You know, when Paul and I came out here fishing last 
    year he stood right here next to this tree and said 'This is where I am going 
    to be buried.'&quot; We looked at each other and shook our heads.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Paul's uncle Matij had already sawed the wood off of his 
    land, and a friend had already built the casket (a beautiful casket). Paul's 
    body was taken by pickup truck the forty-five miles, seven miles off the blacktop 
    road, through the woods to where his remains would be laid right next to that 
    tree. It was a somber gathering, not festive in the same way as when Paul's 
    grandmother was laid to rest some years before. The circumstances were different, 
    darker, harder to understand. &quot;What words could convey the truth here?&quot; 
    Healing is an important matter, and words help to accomplish that, but truth 
    is more important. It sets people free. &quot;What is the truth here?&quot; 
    There were some, no doubt, who felt that Paul's suicide was a weak and selfish 
    act, and that he was thinking only of himself. (There is some truth in this, 
    but it does not explain the whole of it. Besides, holding on to such thoughts 
    leaves us thinking only about ourselves). ). And there were some here who 
    believe suicide is an unforgivable sin, but who do not at the same time consider 
    the cosmic consequences of such belief. These, of course, also believe in 
    a literal hell and were no doubt trying hard to come to grips with the idea 
    that Paul is probably there right now, joined for eternity to the results 
    of his own sinful act. We are not literalists, we would not leave him there.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Words from the heart (I will try to recall them here):</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">&quot;We are here to honor Paul, to honor the brief time 
    we spent with Paul, the very blessing of his existence in our lives. (I could 
    not even imagine my own life without Paul's singular presence in it--without 
    any of the people, especially the young people--who were gathered there in 
    the clearing that day. It was a beautiful day). But how do we understand it, 
    how do we make sense of the way Paul passed from us? It seems so terribly 
    tragic...The times we are living in seem so essential to our understanding 
    of things, to the way we make sense of things in our own minds. Our times 
    are full of meaning. Many of us have just seen <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>. 
    This has meaning here. This film sent a shock wave through our culture, as 
    Paul's passing sent a shock wave through all of us. How is it that one person 
    could feel such a burden? How could one person feel so responsible for <i>the 
    sins</i> of so many, to carry the effects of it all upon themselves alone? 
    How is a Christ person created? The words kept appearing: 'In great joy and 
    great sorrow.' (And obviously in the isolations of one's own mind). </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">&quot;Thirty years ago our family came up into these hills 
    and hollows. We were on a spiritual journey. We came to experience in our 
    own lives these great joys, but also the great sorrows that come with blessed 
    poverty (intentional simplicity is perhaps the better way to put it). And 
    God has, indeed, given them to us in abundant measure.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">&quot;It is here where we met all of you. It is here in these 
    ancient, blessed hills that all of us came into each other's lives, where 
    we began to share each other's journey (as well as each other's sorrows). 
    It is into these circumstances--the circumstances of all of our individual 
    lives--that Paul Matthew Triska was born. Growing up among us he took from 
    each of us what he was supposed to (what he was able to), something essential 
    about each of us (everything happens as it is supposed to, there are no mistakes 
    in the universe, no force stronger than God's will. It is seamless). Then 
    adding what was uniquely essential about himself, Paul is now giving back 
    to us (in the only way he obviously could) exactly what each of us need...the 
    lessons that each of us are capable of carrying away with us. (It seems so 
    terrible, but look all around, the Universe works this way. Sometimes it is 
    hard to understand, but Love is ultimately in operation here, and we must 
    not quit thinking about it until we understand it). </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">&quot;Paul, however, was also born into the another set of 
    circumstances: the circumstances of our times and those of his own generation. 
    (Generation X some have quite fittingly called it). These are the most trying 
    times in history, and more so for those who are presently trying to find their 
    way from adolescence to adulthood. (The pressures are enormous and yet so 
    perfecting. And for good reason, this is the generation that is about to inherit 
    the world to come). We are passing through a vortex in human consciousness, 
    a time in which the cosmic forces of Light and Darkness are struggling against 
    each other as never before. (Both, of course, emanate from the same source, 
    from God, which is why we must keep faith in all of these matters, even though 
    it is extremely difficult at times to keep it all in a higher spiritual perspective). 
    They are struggling, not only for the soul of the planet but for the souls 
    of every individual. But not simply <i>for</i> the soul of every individual 
    but <i>in </i>the soul of every individual. The greater conflicts being waged 
    in the world today are first and foremost internal ones, and are being waged 
    on the tiny battlefield of our own individual minds.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Paul%27sDemon.jpg" width="555" height="415"></p>
  <p align="center"><b>A sign of Paul's own private mental journey. </b></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Most of us tend toward the Light, toward Love. Some of us 
    tend toward these things but do not find them (not in the ways that refresh 
    and satisfy the soul, but we keep searching. Paul did not find them, and it 
    seems that he gave up the search. This young man carried a bi-polar gene in 
    him, and a predisposition for clinical depression, both of which he <i>seemed</i> 
    to have under wraps. No doubt this lay at the root, and were at the crux of 
    Paul's conflict. He had it all internalized). Paul's tendency (as a result) 
    was to the Dark side. He felt inwardly alone. Where others of his generation 
    coped with the &quot;normal&quot; problems of adolescence, he became, as we 
    see now, obsessed by them. (He had convinced himself that he would never find 
    true love, not in this lifetime, and that he should not even look for it--in 
    a world governed by so much <i>hypocrisy</i> and <i>insincerity</i> as this 
    world is. Youthful narcissism? taken to the extreme? Perhaps. He also had 
    some reason to think this way, Paul had been hurt by love. Where his friends 
    and close cousins at least had families to call their own, he was a child 
    of divorce. Where others seemed attractive he seemed unattractive, at least 
    in his own eyes. He was also reaching for the distinction between &quot;sex,&quot; 
    in his writings, which almost anyone can have, and the idea of true love which 
    he was sure he could not have. He was convinced that no one could love him. 
    The last thing he said to one of his cousins was: &quot;Joel, why do you like 
    me? Joel answered, &quot;Because I love you, you're my friend.&quot; How deeply 
    important are the words we use, and the way we use them. Paul may have latched 
    onto those words as he went across. But where had he learned this other language, 
    the words that lent form to his feelings of despair, even outrage and hatred? 
    When did he adopt the philosophy of annihilation? Perhaps if when he bought 
    his first guitar, he had found the music and the lyrics of someone like Peter 
    Gabriel first...</font></p>

      that many of their love songs are left ambiguous so that they could refer 
      to the love between man and woman or the love between man and God. That 
      interested me, because in our society it's a little like the sacred versus 
      the profane--you know, church music, for instance, expresses a religious 
      type of love, and romantic love belongs to the Devil, if you like. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;So

      on the critical list, Gabriel lost all interest in rock and roll stardom. 
      His band was faced with a leader who now detested the lavish acclaim they 
      resented him for. Gabriel pulled the plug on the star-making machine and 
      moved his family to the rural anonymity of the lush Bath valley. The change 
      in Gabriel was so extreme that some feared for his sanity. &quot;Peter spent 
      the first six months making a vegetable garden and appeared to be going

      The social engagement of rock musicians is positive, although I don't think 
      we can change the world as directly as many people thought was once possible. 
      What we <i>can</i> do is provide information and then let people make up

      unemployment...The catalyst for &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; was a photograph

      as a trigger for the animal nature to surface.' Onstage, Gabriel imbues 
      the song with a vivid dash of affirmation, testifying that humanity has 
      the will to resist its baser urges, just as the jailer, torturer, and executioner 
      can be dissuaded from their odious duties.&quot;...(p.722)...</font></p>

      in life. The song refers to experiments conducted...in the early 1960s...that 
      tested obedience to authority versus allegiance to one's moral code...'I 
      was comforted that some had the strength to rebel...(also scary), particularly 
      with the rise of the so-called Moral Majority, that there's such a readiness

<p><font size="+1">Most of Paul's writings, and the lyrics of his songs, are deeply 
  personal, and express in the dark genre of this generation the hurt, the isolation 
  and the estrangement he felt from the most essential ingredients of life. We 
  leave them to those for whom they are intended. Was Paul possessed? Yes, by 
  the twin demons of despair and hopelessness. (Perception is reality). Yes, by 
  the failings of his parents. (Blaming our parents, however, is an escape from 
  maturity, and is ultimately to blame God. For the parent can blame their parents, 
  and so on all the way back to Creation. Somewhere along the way someone has 
  to stop blaming others and take responsibility for their own life, and for the 
  effects their life has had, and is having, on the lives of others. (This, of 
  course, is the role of every spiritually responsible person), and then make 
  an atonement. As hard as it may be the one who realizes and breaks the cycle 
  must also change. And that is the ultimate meaning in all of this. An atonement 
  has been made. Changes are required. Of course, God does assume responsibility 
  for it all, which is why we must not be quick to judge Paul or anyone else in 
  this matter. We must put it all in higher context. God has, indeed, created 
  all the conditions in which we find ourselves today. God sees each strand, knows 
  each soul, and knows exactly what it takes to transform--both individually and 
  collectively--the human heart and mind. <i>I kill and I make alive...I form 
  the light, and create darkness, I the Lord do all these things...</i>(Deuteronomy 
  32:39; Isaiah 45:7) We are, in fact, still be created, being <i>fired</i> to 
  perfection as it is, and these (as well as everything that is happening in the 
  earth at this time), are the final trials of our faith. We pray that the lesson 
  here is sufficient for all of us. Was Paul possessed? Yes, beyond his own individual 
  circumstances, by the intense apocalyptic spirit that pervades the American 
  state of mind. And yes, by the dark side of Rock and Roll, by the rage (mostly 
  adolescent and subliminal), that emanates directly out of this society's inability 
  to recognize and come to grips with the pervasive evil, with the alienation 
  from the truth and from <i>true</i> Love, that overshadows the social, political, 
  economic and religious landscape of this country. </font></p>

  when he came home to his apartment at night he would get high (the incoherence

<p><font size="+1">Paul and his uncle Peter recently spent some time together 
  at Ritter Park. Peter recalls Paul sort of mystically stepping back and forth 
  inside this life-size, oval sculpture that is erected there. It is supposed 
  to represent the Egg of the Universe and the portal through time and space. 
  The journey was already in his mind. John recalled a day or two before Paul 
  passed over, during a conversation with a couple of girls at the same park, 
  that Paul stood back, looking down, shuffling his feet. Paul had given up hope 
  of a meaningful relationship. He was convinced that there was not much about 
  him that a girl could be attracted to. It seems that it was actually some girl 
  trouble that might have pushed him over that night. I don't know the full story 
  about it yet, so I will not try to fill in the pieces here. But I do remember 
  some time ago that I heard Paul say, &quot;I really would like to make love 
  to a girl.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">&quot;Among the last words that Paul wrote were those that 
  said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font size="3">I would give anything for some peace of mind
one minute ray of light is all I ask of my supposed savior</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">&quot;A</font><font size="3"> <font size="+1">picture of Lt. 
  Dan sitting on top of that mast, challenging God in the hurricane, came to my 
  mind. Paul, sitting alone in the front seat of his car, in the dark, challenging 
  God to provide him that <i>one ray of light</i>. &quot;If you are real, if you 
  are there, then save me.&quot; Because God did not stop him from pulling the 
  trigger, I can only imagine the voice inside of Paul's mind saying: &quot;Prove 
  me, come over, and see if I do not provide the Light.&quot; BANG!</font></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><font size="+1">&quot;We can not presume to judge what Paul 
  did. We must open up new fields of understanding. Whether out of purpose or 
  absolute despair Paul made a sacrifice of himself that night. He made a leap 
  of faith. And besides (pointing to the gravesite of his grandmother, the one 
  who cradled him in her own arms when he was born), she was already there to 
  receive him. 'This is one of mine,' we can hear her saying, as she reached out 
  to draw that <i>light ray</i> back up to herself. It says in the written word 
  (and God keeps Their word), that whatsoever we bind (in the light) on earth, 
  shall be bound in heaven, and so all of us today have the authority, and power, 
  to join with heaven and bind Paul's spirit to other side (the other side of 
  Life that is).&quot; </font></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Paul's sister Olivia read a heart-touching letter, forgiving 
  him and releasing his spirit, as did his sister Zelenka's daughter, Kindra. 
  And then Trish Clark's voice elevated all of us to the strains of <i>In the 
  Arms of an Angel</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Paul was buried under the shadow of the family Tree. The Stewarts, 
  Paul's other family, brought roses for everyone to lay in Paul's grave. Everyone, 
  children and grownups alike, gathered around to cover his body and give it back 
  to the earth. The Fintons, gracious Betty and her family, had a wonderful meal 
  prepared up at the house. On my way I looked back and noticed that two little 
  girls, Jodi and Kalila, had lingered at the gravesite. I walked back and found 
  Jodi patting the ground and planting flowers on the fresh mound of earth. Kalila 
  was sitting on top of the grave, alone in her own thoughts, singing and drawing 
  pictures in the soil. As Jodi and I walked together to the house, we looked 
  back and hollared to Kalila, &quot;Do you want us to wait for you?&quot; She 
  just waved, still by herself in her own distant thoughts, &quot;No, I'm alright.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A day or two later Bob, whose opinions I truely value, wrote 
  to say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <b>Michael,<br>
    <br>
    I understand that you so wanted to find some positive thing to say at the 
    funeral, but it is both wrong and dangerous to term suicide as sacrifice--especially 
    before so many teenagers. Suicide is the antethisis of sacrifice. Laying down 
    one's life is in no case the same as taking one's own life. b.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thinking long and hard about it all, I wrote back:</font><br>
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Yes, I know that there are injunctions and sanctions inscribed in the 
    &quot;literal&quot; Torah against taking one's own life. And I </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(sincerely)</font><b> 
    understand your concern, not only for the terminology of sacrifice but for 
    the impressionable young minds who might possibly get those definitions confused. 
    But I don't believe they can. Death (like the Mystery of Christ itself, the 
    most profound of human mysteries) is a calling, and I do not believe a person 
    can call themself (against the will of the Universe) into a relationship with 
    it. If such matters are not an already compelling part of a person's very 
    own stream of consciousness the very thought of it will pass over them like 
    ripples on a pond. It will touch them, for sure, and speak to them in certain 
    essential ways, but not in the same way as it did to Paul. Those young people 
    saw his mangled body, it was nothing to emulate and I am sure it gave them 
    shudders. If they were angry at life (or in despair of it) I am sure it gave 
    them pause to consider. The adolescent conversation that several of those 
    young boys </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Paul's friends)</font><b> 
    were already having with death (and with Paul), suddenly became reality. It 
    struck them like lightning and we are certain that it altered their entire 
    sense of things. It is in that sense that I spoke of a sacrifice. Thousands 
    upon thousands of young people are being sent (or called) away from their 
    families and communities to make what the nation and church considers to be 
    the &quot;perfect and acceptable sacrifice&quot; of themselves on the battlefields 
    of this world (committing in the offering both murder and suicide). It is 
    in this sense that Paul's death is a sacrifice, or a &quot;counter-sacrifice&quot; 
    if you will. I will tell his story to many young people who presently are 
    (and who will be very soon) in conflict themselves over whether to obey and 
    go, or to resist and pay (not the ultimate price but) the immediate penalty. 
    There were also several people in that circle who were partly, and even greatly 
    responsible for the burdens (the emotional and psychlogical afflictions) that 
    weighed on Paul so heavily (those insincerities and hypocrisies that I mentioned, 
    and which molded at least half of his approach to life). Paul's &quot;sacrifice&quot; 
    was for them, so that they might wake up to see the Darkness in themselves 
    and own up to their complicity in Paul's decision to &quot;uncreate&quot; 
    himself and start over as he wrote. </b></p>
  <p><b>The alternative to seeing the great Light in all of this was to consign 
    Paul to the Darkness. I chose instead (and it was not my intention to do so 
    arrogantly in the face of others) to come boldly before the Throne of Grace, 
    not only with the words &quot;That I might not lose any that He has given 
    me,&quot; but with an understanding that the Mystery of Christ's passion and 
    death is bigger, more sublime and more inclusive of every form of human affliction 
    than any off us can presently imagine, and that Christ suffered in Paul for 
    many of his own....Oh well, that is something of my sense of it all. Perhaps 
    it is too esoteric, exceeds limits and stretches the boundaries that separate 
    heaven from earth. But perhaps it stretched (or expanded) some people's sense 
    of God's Real Presence in the Universe--in both the Light and the Darkness. 
    We shall see...</b></p>
  <p><b>An evil Tree cannot bring forth good fruit. If Paul's death was not of 
    God then it will result in no good thing, and everything will deteriorate 
    from that point. But we are already seeing profound changes in the lives of 
    those Paul touched. We shall see...Until then I will carry around your criticism 
    and reflect upon it in a serious way, and will not always equate suicide with 
    sacrifice. But this christ I knew. Thanks again for being there, in more ways 
    than one...</b></p>

    I began to see into your powerful choice as an act of great courage and sacrifice. 
    Being that you are so full of light, I figure you must have given yourself 
    over to exploring the depth of humanity in such a way that you were caught 
    by the darkness and you gave yourself over to. It was loving and it was brave. 
    God be with you Paul.</p>
  <p>To think that you made this choice and you remained present to it all the 
    way to the end blows my sense of myself wide open. It is hard for me to imagine 
    what it would take to pull the trigger paul...that you made a conscious act 
    of faith, you chose to die to yourself. You gave yourself over to being born 
    again.</p>
  <p>When I reflect on it I see nothing but a warrior deed. You accomplished your 
    mission paul. In a way, you pave the way of death for us all. And you gave 
    a gift in your act. I know on a certain level, you knew what you were<br>
    doing. I am inspired by your courage paul. I hope to have the same courage 
    over death paul that I will need to complete my mission here. Because I see 
    your choice to take your own life as a sacrifice, and because it moves me 
    so deeply paul...I can see that you came into this life plainly to make such 
    a sacrifice as you have. You touch me at the level of soul. I recognize your 
    sacrifice as a pathway to life paul, as an indication of the challenges to 
    come, as a calling forth of my own bravery in these end times. I know you 
    did this to remind us of our duty to give our lives over to our work.</p>
  <p>Paul, I promise to give my life. I promise to give it IN LIVING. For in your 
    dying I am moved to live through the death of my own fears of life. And for 
    this I am clear that we are brethren, born of the same spiritual metal. Born 
    to die, to sacrifice and cause life.</p>
  <p>Paul. You show the way of sacrifice. I knew you before this life, and I know 
    that I will be with you again. I will see you again paul, but not until our 
    work is complete here...no matter what.</p>

  <p align="center">A LETTER FROM HEAVEN</p>
  <p>Hey, Nanna is like...I can't really describe it. She's like a goddess up 
    here but she won't even acknowledge it. She says we're all equal and keeps 
    reminding us of that. You should see where she lives....it's beautiful. I've 
    been hanging out with her. That's all I want to do right now. Papa's gonna 
    be surprised. Grandma Anna is here. You should see her. You know that fairy 
    queen in the Lord of the Rings...yep, it looks just like her...when she's 
    not turning invisible that is. I'm going to stay here for a while, but I have 
    a choice to make sometime in the near future. I'm thinking about coming back. 
    I left a lot of things undone, and I guess I want to get back here the next 
    time, you know...the right way, the way that people should. (I don't know 
    what I was thinking). I discovered secrets about solar energy and I'll bring 
    them back with me if I come. And, well, I still want to to make love to a 
    girl, to my own girl...you know, not just sex, anyone can can do that, but 
    real love. I could wait for her to show up here, but I'm sure if I return 
    she'll be there too. Wherever she is we'll find each other. I'm using Papa's 
    mind here but it's the same. We're all on the same wavelength. OK, so if I 
    decide to come back I'll try to give you all a sign. Don't worry, we get to 
    know each other perfectly when we get back here. Nothing is lost here, only 
    bad memories. We will always be together. You should see who all of us were 
    in our other lives, but I'm leaving all that for you to discover when you 
    get here. It's cool how they know all that stuff up here. I keep saying 'up 
    here.' Well that's where I am, and I am going to enjoy it while I'm here. 
    &quot;I might stay but I might come back. The choice is mine. Hey Joel, I 
    might even choose to be one of your kids. Ho ho ho. Okay, everyone sleep sound. 
    I'm okay now. Hey Olivia, you better learn how to play that guitar, and no 
    barroom stuff. I might want to come to one of your concerts some time in the 
    future, or just listen to you around a campfire somewhere. I might be one 
    of those kids sitting at your feet. You too Kendra and you too Jared. You 
    all have to grow up and help make the world a good place. Hey Mom, I love 
    you, sorry for giving you all the trouble. Love...hmmmmm, let's see now, I 
    have to figure out what my next name will be. </p>
  <p align="center">_______</p>
  <p align="left">Since March 11th Paul's life, is playing over and over inside 
    my mind, my thoughts scarring about, gathering each and every detail and examining 
    his very existence....I am thinking that Paul has no need to come back, because 
    I feel Paul's spirit was an old spirit..Paul had too much understanding of 
    higher matters...and Paul was so kind, so generous to all..Things are not 
    what they seem..To understand, to see, we must look at everything with a different 
    approach, like looking through a broken mirror or reading backwards...I have 
    even stood on my head..and I come up with the same answers each time..I am 
    convinced that Paul's spirit came knowingly into this world on a mission. 
    Oddly as it sounds, Paul is a GREAT HEALER! I am guessing that he was lonely 
    at times because he was hoping he didn't have to go (like this)..but a great 
    healer must do what a healer must do. I believe this because I refuse to believe 
    that Paul's life had no purpose or great reason...I have taken many steps 
    back, hoping to witness THE GREAT HEALING ..like catching a glimpse of a shooting 
    star. I am waiting for it to happen....Anyways its really hard to express 
    what I am trying to say..I know one thing for sure what is IS! Now I have 
    to find peace and happiness in everything, I guess it is the meaning of faith.. 
    I know now that we have control of nothing. I will find the beauty in this...I 
    will be at peace with my heart in time..when I become unselfish, and come 
    to terms with him not being here with me (us). I keep thinking..how funny; 
    if Paul truly thought he could un-create himself...the joke is on him...LOL!! 
    Paul is now bigger than before..He is the UNIVERSE..I have to learn to be 
    glad for Paul...I am happy , Paul is now LOVE itself....I love you</p>
  <p align="center">__________</p>
  <p>Here are a few thoughts.... which i needed to share ...nothin earthshattering 
    , but in my heart ...................<br>
    <br>
    My heart feels the pain ,the pain of you gone...it is a state of sadness that 
    you left us in, a mirror of your state, so now at last we see you .So sorry 
    to have missed what you could not say...a picture paints a thousand words 
    .Perhaps i saw what you wanted &amp; longed to be .... a piece of us ,content 
    in the collective love we have made for ourselves in this bleak world.....and 
    now, in the void where once you stood i wait on the Lord of my soul for that 
    which surely will sprout in this garden , for ever true are the words once 
    spoken by the great tender of this plot.....&quot;and it will be spring again 
    ,and Gods gifts are everlasting....and a ROSE is a ROSE&quot;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>Dear God,
 
I know you've heard this before, At least I know I've cried it a dozen
     times or more.

I wish I knew why some people are so sad. And then what makes others

     so terrible and bad.

What causes some to rob, and others to cry 'thief!' Why some are happy

     while others gather grief.

I wish that I could be so many things that I am not, to understand

     the pattern, to compliment the plot.

Still, I suppose I am exactly as I need to be...

For you remain the gardener in the field, who waters the ground

     and plants the tree.

    <br>
    In the Dawning of Day, i wake to the sound of life .it is all around me ....it 
    beats to a rythym and has a pulse....I cannot change it ,only ride its tide, 
    It floods my senses.Do I hear the birds singing thier wakeup songs ? See the 
    brightness of Sun on Terra? Do I taste &amp; smell the richness of life in 
    my cup? Or feel the chill of the morning spring breeze?........It washes over 
    me and I amb dazzled by it;'s beauty! I am thankful to have this moment, for 
    it is a culmination of every moment that has ever been. The tear I shed is 
    eagerly swallowed up by earth &amp; seed and its intention is lifted on high 
    to the ears of my Father,who pours down the rain....the healing rains of spring, 
    so that all may grow according to its season...Blessed is this day&amp; Blessed

      made was an ocean scene with crashing waves. In the distance were the dark 
      clouds of a passing storm. I could tell the storm was passing because beautiful 
      sun beams lit the water below. As I stared at the puzzle I realized that 
      it was missing a piece. I almost overlooked it. Whoever had put the puzzle 
      together painted in perfectly the missing piece. So although your piece

<p align="center">THE TIBETAN BOOK OF LIVING AND DYING</p>
<p align="center">by Sogyal Rinpoche</p>
<p align="left">Look still deeper into impermanance, and you'll find it has another 
  message, another face, one of great hope, one that opens your eyes to the fundamental 
  nature of the Universe, and our extraordinary relationship to it.</p>
<p align="left">If everything is impermanent, then everything is what we call 
  &quot;empty,&quot; which means lacking any lasting, stable, and inherent existence; 
  and all things, when seen and understood in their true relation, are not independent 
  but interdependent with all other things. The Buddha compared the universe to 
  a vest net woven of a countless variety of brilliant jewels, each with a countless 
  number of facets. Each jewel <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(each 
  soul)</font> reflects in itself every other jewel in the net and is, in fact, 
  one with every other jewel...</p>
<p align="left">Think of a tree. When you think of a tree, you tend to think of 
  a distinctly defined object; and on a certain level...it is. But when you look 
  more closely at the tree, you will see that ultimately it has no independent 
  existence. When you contemplate it, you will find that it dissolves into an 
  extremely subtle net of relationships that stretch across the universe. The 
  rain that falls on its leaves, the wind that sways it, the soil that nourishes 
  and sustains it, all the seasons and the weather, moonlight and starlight and 
  sunlight--all form part of the tree. As you begin to think about the tree more 
  and more, you will discover that everything in the universe helps to make the 
  tree what it is; that it cannot at any moment be isolated from anything else; 
  and that at every moment its nature is subtly changing. This is what we mean 
  when we say things are &quot;empty,&quot; that they have no independent existence...</p>
<p align="left">So when we really look at ourselves, then, and the things around 
  us that we took to be so solid, so stable, and so lasting, we find that they 
  have no more reality than a dream <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(a 
  four-dimensional holographic dream)</font>. Buddha said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>Know all things to be like this:
A mirage, a cloud castle,
A dream, an apparition,
Without essence, but with qualities that can be seen.


Know all things to be like this:

As the moon in the bright sky

In some clear lake reflected,
Though to that lake the moon has never moved.



Know all things to be like this:

As an echo that derives

From music, sounds, and weeping, 

Yet in that echo is no melody.



Know all things to be like this:
As a magician makes illusions

OF horses, oxen, cars and other things,

Nothing is as it appears.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>True spirituality also is to be aware that if we are interdependent with everything 
  and everyone else, even our smallest, least significant thought, word, and action 
  have real consequences throughout the universe. Throw a pebble into a pond. 
  It sends a shiver across the surrface of the water. Ripples merge into one another 
  and create new ones. Everything is inextricably interrelated: We come to realize 
  we are responsible for everything we do, say, or think, responsible in fact 
  for ourselves, everyone and everything else, and the entire universe...</p>
<p>THE CHANGELESS</p>
<p>Impermanence has already revealed to us many truths, but it has a final treasure 
  still in its keeping, one that lies largely hidden from us, unsuspected and 
  unrecognized, yet most intimately our own...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg06.gif" width="662" height="301"></p>
<p align="left">The Western poet Rainer Maria Rilke has said that our deepest 
  fears are like dragons guarding our deepest treasure. The fear that impermanence 
  awakens in us, that nothing is real and nothing lasts, is, we come to discover, 
  our greatest friend because it drives us to ask: If everything dies, and changes, 
  then what is really true? Is there something behind the appearances, something 
  boundless and infinitely spacious, something in which the dance of change and 
  impermanence takes place? Is there something in fact we can depend on, that 
  does survive what we call death?</p>
<p align="left">Allowing these questions to occupy us urgently, and reflecting 
  on them, we slowly find ourselves making a profound shift in the way we view 
  everything. With continued contemplation and practice in letting go, we come 
  to uncover in ourselves &quot;something&quot; we cannot name or describe or 
  conceptualize, &quot;something&quot; that we begin to realize lies behind all 
  the changes and death in the world....As this happens we catch repeated and 
  glowing glimpses of the vast implications behind the truth of impermanence. 
  It is as if all our lives we have been flying in an airplane through dark clouds 
  and turbulence, when suddenly the plane soars above these into the clear, boundless 
  sky. Inspired and exhilarated by this emergence into a new dimension of freedom, 
  we come to uncover a depth of peace, joy, and confidence in ourselves that fills 
  us with wonder, and breeds in us gradually a certainty that there is in us &quot;something&quot; 
  that nothing destroys, that nothing alters, and cannot die...</p>
<p align="left">Gradually, then, we become aware in ourselves of the calm and 
  sky-like presence of what Milarepa calls the deathless and unending nature of 
  mind. And as this new awareness begins to become vivid and almost unbroken, 
  there occurs what the Upanishads call a &quot;turning about in the seat of consciousness,&quot; 
  a personal, utterly non-conceptual revelation of what we are, why we are here, 
  and hoow we should act, which amounts in the end to nothing less than a new 
  life, a new birth, almost, you could say, a resurrection.</p>
<p align="left">What a beautiful and what a healing mystery it is that from contemplating, 
  continually and fearlessly, the truth of change and impermanence, we come slowly 
  to find ourselves face to face, in gratitude and joy, with the truth of the 
  chageless, with the truth of the deathless, unending nature of mind.</p>
<p align="left">THE NATURE OF MIND</p>
<p align="left">Confined in the dark narrow cage (of our own thoughts, and our 
  own perceptions) which we take for the whole universe, very few of us can even 
  begin to imagine another dimension of reality. Patrul Rinpoche tells the story 
  of an old frog who had lived all his life in a dank well. One day a from from 
  the sea paid him a visit.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre align="left">&quot;Where do you come from?&quot; asked the frog in the well.
&quot;From the great ocean,&quot; he replied.

&quot;How big is your ocean?&quot;

&quot;It's gigantic.&quot;

&quot;You mean about a quarter of the size of my well here?&quot;

&quot;Bigger.&quot;

&quot;Bigger? You mean half as big?&quot;
&quot;No, even bigger.&quot;
&quot;Is it...as big as this well?&quot;
&quot;There is no comparison.&quot;
&quot;That's impossible! I've got to see this for myself.&quot;
They set off together. When the frog from the well saw the ocean, it was such a

     shock that his head exploded in pieces.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">The still revolutionary insight of Buddhism (and, of course, true 
  Christianity) is that <i>life and death are in the mind, and nowhere else</i>. 
  Mind (and in the West we speak of the Mind of Universe--the Mind of God, of 
  which our own individual minds are a part) is revealed as the universal basis 
  of experience--the creator of happiness and the creator of suffering, the creator 
  of what we call life and what we call death. </p>
<p align="left">There are many aspects to the mind, but two stand out. The first 
  is the ordinary mind, called by the Tibetans <i>sem</i>. One master defines 
  it: &quot;That which possesses discriminating awareness, that which possesses 
  a sense of duality--which grasps or rejects something external--that is mind. 
  Fundamentally it is that which can associate with an 'other'--with any 'something' 
  that is perceived as different from the perceiver.&quot; Sem is the discursive, 
  dualistic, thinking mind, which can only function in relation to the projected 
  and falsely perceived external reference point.</p>
<p align="left">So sem in the mind that thinks, plots, desires, manipulates, that 
  flares up in anger, that creates and indulges in waves of negative emotions 
  and thoughts, that has to go and on asserting, validating, and confirming its 
  'existence' by fragmenting, conceptualizing, and solidifying experience. The 
  ordinary mind is the ceaselessly shifting and shiftless prey of external influences, 
  habitual tendencies, and conditioning: The masters liken sem to a candle flame 
  in an open doorway, vulnerable to all the winds of circumstances...</p>
<p align="left">Then there is the very nature of mind, its innermost essence, 
  which is absolutely and always untouched by change or death. At present it is 
  hidden within our own mind, our sem, enveloped and obscured by the mental scurry 
  of our thoughts and emotions. Just as clouds can be shifted by a strong gust 
  of wind to reveal the shining sun and wide-open sky, so under certain special 
  circumstances, some inspiration may uncover for us glimpses of this nature of 
  mind. These glimpses have many depths and degrees, but each of them will bring 
  some light of understanding, meaning, and freedom. This is because the nature 
  of mind is the very Root itself of understanding. In Tibetan we call it <i>Rigpa</i>, 
  a primordial, pure, pristine awareness that is at once intelligent, cognizent, 
  radiant, and always awake. It could be said to be the knowledge of knowledge 
  itself.</p>
<p align="left">Do not make the mistake of imagining that the nature of mind is 
  exclusive to our mind only. It is in fact the nature of everything. It can never 
  be said too often that to realize the nature of mind is to realize the nature 
  of all things. Saints and mystics throughout history have adorned their realizations 
  with different names and given them different faces and interpretations. (Of 
  course, in the West we say that this adornment proceeds from the Mind of the 
  Universe, as do the names, the faces and the interpretations), but what thay 
  are all fundamentally experiencing is the essential nature of the mind. Christians 
  and Jews call it God; Hindus call it &quot;the Self,&quot; &quot;Brahma,&quot; 
  &quot;Vishnu,&quot; and &quot;Shiva;&quot; Sufi mystics name it &quot;the Hidden 
  Essence,&quot; and Buddhists call it &quot;buddha nature.&quot; At the heart 
  of all religions is the certainty that there is a fundamental truth, and that 
  this life is a sacred opportunity to evolve and realize it.</p>
<p align="left">When we say Buddha, we naturally think of the Indian prince Gautama 
  Siddhartha who reached enlightenment in the sixth century BC, and who taught 
  the spiritual path followed by millions all over Asia, known today as Buddhism. 
  <i>Buddha</i>, however, has a much deeper meaning. It means a person, any person, 
  who has completely awakened from ignorance and opened to his or her vast potential 
  of wisdom. A buddha is one who has brought a final end to suffering and frustration, 
  and discovered a lasting and deathless happiness and peace.</p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The quest for an earthly 
    Paradise is one of the oldest and most enduring themes of mythology. Ancient 
    clay tablets dating back to the 2nd millennium B.C. tell of the hero Gilgamesh 
    and his epic journey to the Garden of the Sun in search of the secrets of 
    immortality. In the 2nd century B.C. the Chinese emperor Wu Ti sent envoys 
    looking for the mythical palace of Hsi Wang Mu--the dwelling place of the 
    immortals, hidden in the mysterious Kunlun Mountains of Central Asia. During 
    the Middle Ages Irish monks set out on the Atlantic, seeking legendary isles 
    of the Blessed where they might find salvation. Centuries later the Pilgrims 
    crossed the ocean, hoping to find a Garden of Eden in the new world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tibetans have long held a tradition 
    of just such an earthly Paradise, called Shambhala--a mythical kingdom that 
    is hidden among the Snow mountains north of Tibet. </font>(Snow, a six-stemmed 
    crystal is another symbol of that hidden place named Beauty on the Tree of 
    Life).<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There in the sanctuary free 
    from strife and want, a line of divine kings is said to be preserving the 
    highest teachings of Buddhism for a time in the future when barbarians will 
    destroy all true religion in the world outside. When the barbarians try to 
    conquer even Shambhala, a Saviour king will emerge with a supernatural army 
    to defeat them in great battle and establish a golden age throughout the world.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Buddhist prayer: &quot;MAY I 
    QUICKLY TAKE BIRTH IN SHAMBHALA, THE TREASURY OF JEWELS, AND COMPLETE THE 
    STAGES OF THE HIGHEST YOGA TANTRA.&quot;</font><font size="+1"> </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">But for many of us in this skeptical age, this state may seem 
  like a fantasy or a dream, or an achievement far beyond our reach. It is important 
  to remember always that Buddha was a human being. He never claimed divinity, 
  he merely knew that he had the buddha nature, the seed of enlightenment, and 
  that everyone else did too. The buddha nature is simply the birthright of every 
  sentient being, and I always say, &quot;Our buddha nature is as good as an buddha's 
  buddha nature.&quot; Thiis is the good news that the Buddha brought us from 
  his enlightenment in Bodhgayya, and which many people find so inspiring. His 
  message--<i>that enlightenment is within the reach of all of us</i>--holds out 
  tremendous hope. Through practice, we too can all become awakened. If this were 
  not true, countless individuals down to the present day would not have become 
  enlightened...</p>
<p align="left">THE SKY AND THE CLOUDS</p>
<p align="left">So whatever our lives are like, our buddha nature <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(our 
  Christ-conscious mind)</font> is always there. And it is always perpect. We 
  say that not even the Buddhas can improveit in their infinite wisdom, nor can 
  sentient beings spoil it in their infinite confusion. Our true nature can be 
  compared to the sky, and the confusion of the ordinary mind to clouds. Some 
  days the sky is completely obscured with clouds...</p>
<p align="left">We should always try and remember: the clouds are not the sky, 
  and do not &quot;belong&quot; to it. They only hang there and pass by in their 
  slightly ridiculous and non-dependent fashion. They can never stain or mark 
  the sky in any way. So where exactly is this buddha nature? It is in the sky-like 
  nature of our mind. Utterly open, free, and limitless, it is fundamentally so 
  simple and so natural that it cannever be complicated, corrupted, or stained, 
  so pure that it is beyond even the concept of purity and inpurity. To talk of 
  this nature of mind as sky-like, of course, is only a metaphor that helps us 
  to imagine its all-embracing boundlessness; for the buddha nature has a quality 
  the sky cannot have, that of the radiant clarity of awareness...</p>
<p align="left">THE PROMISE OF ENLIGHTENMENT</p>
<p align="left">In the modern world, there are few examples of human beings who 
  embody the qualities that come from realizing the nature of mind. So it is hard 
  for us to imagine enlightenment or the perception of an enlightened being, and 
  even harder to begin to think that we ourselves could become enlightened.</p>
<p align="left">For all its vaunted celebration of the value of human life and 
  individual liberty, our society in fact treats us as obsessed only with power, 
  sex, and money, and needing to be distracted at any moment from any contact 
  with death, or with real life. If we are told of or begin to suspect our deep 
  potential, we cannot believe it; and if we cannot conceive of spiritual transformation 
  at all, we see it as only possible for the great saints and spiritual masters 
  of the past...Underlying our whole outlook is a neurotic conviction of our own 
  limitations. This denies us all hope of awakening, and tragically contradicts 
  the central truth of Buddha's teaching: that we are all already essentially 
  perfect.</p>
<p align="left">Even if we were to think of the possibility of enlightenment, 
  one look at what composes our ordinary mind--anger, greed, jealousy, spite, 
  cruelty, lust, fear, anxiety, and turmoil--would undermine forever any hope 
  of achieving it, if we had not been told about the nature of mind, and the possibility 
  of coming to realize that nature beyond doubt...</p>
<p align="left">The wonder of this promise is that it is not something exotic, 
  not fantastic, not for an elite, but for all of humanity; and when we realize 
  it...it is unexpectedly ordinary. <br>
