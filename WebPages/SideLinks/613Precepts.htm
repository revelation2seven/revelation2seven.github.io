<blockquote> 
  <p align="center">(This chapter, as the Torah itself, is under construction. 
    The reader is invited to mix morter and add stones. We will, with the time 
    remaining to us, be attempting to interpret all 613 precepts of the Literal 
    Torah in light of the revelations of the Tree of Life. After we are gone the 
    project shall continue under the auspices of God's Anointed Ones, the Messiahs 
    of DaViD, who shall sit upon the Throne of David for ever and ever).<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>,

    of the Lord's House shall be established in the top of the mountains, and 
    shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow into it.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us 
    go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He 
    will teach us of His ways, and we walk in His paths: for out of Zion shall 
    go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah

    the Law, they that digged it are those in Israel who repented and departed

    Isaiah has employed an analogous piece of imagery when in allusion to the 
    Law has spoke of God's producing a tool for his work. (Isaiah 54:16). As for 
    the nobles of the people, these are those who come, throughout the Era of 
    Wickedness, to delve the well, using their staves (Heb. <i>mehoqeq</i>), the 
    statutes (Heb. <i>huq-im</i>) which the lawgiver prescribed for them to walk 
    in, without such implements they would, indeed, never achieve their goal until

<p><font size="+1">It was Judah's (Judaism's) historic mission to preserve the 
  Written Law. The rabbis in the time of Christ were commanded to place a fence 
  around the Torah, to safeguard it as it were (so that it would not be lost, 
  or permanently obscured in the light of its own higher meanings). Judaism was 
  also commanded to get inside of that fence, along with the Torah, and to stay 
  there until its mission was complete and it was called from behind the fence 
  (or the hedge) in the last day...</font></p>

  </i>as it is written <i> Thou shalt not seeth a kid in his mother's milk...</i>(Deuteronomy 
  14:21) The Written Torah is the Mother's Milk. The <i>kid</i> is the offspring, 
  and, in our time, the Remnant on the Christian side of the Oracle...(Isaiah

<p><font size="+1">We have arrived at the time of the Seventh and Eighth sefirot 
  on the Tree of Life as it is also written: <i>Then shall we raise against him

  shepherds and Eight principle men.</i> (Micah 5:5), and <i>They shall see Eye 
  to Eye</i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Torah has come down to us in two forms, a Written form 
  and an Oral. The Written Law was passed down (safeguarded) on the one side of 
  the Oracle, along the timeline that leads from the figure of Moses to the beginning 
  of this present age--when Paul (the Pharisee, Elisha ben Abuyah), and the other 
  Tannaim of that time, appeared in the historical account of Israel--to those 
  in the Jewish faith who are still keeping its precepts in our own time. (It 
  came down to us via Understanding, Power and Majesty).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The original Oral Tradition (the supernal, hidden meanings 
  of the Torah), was passed down on the other side of the Oracle, along that line 
  that leads from the figure of Aaron to the time of the Essene, John the Baptist, 
  and from then into the unfolding events of our own time--from Wisdom to Love 
  (or Mercy) to Endurance. This realization is the foundation upon which both 
  present-day Judaism and Christianity, as well as Islam, stand. The original 
  Oral Tradition--the original hidden meanings of the Law--entrusted to Aaron 
  and his seed, accompanied the mind of Israel back up into the center of the 
  Hebrew mysteries, and were committed to that empty place in the upper half of 
  the Oracle named Da'at until the times were full. Thus the words:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Think not that I have come to destroy the law, or the 
    prophets. I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one 
    jot or one tittle shall no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments 
    and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. 
    But whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the 
    kingdom of heaven.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But I say unto you, except your righteousness shall EXCEED 
    the righteousness of the scribes and the pharisees, ye shall in no case enter 
    the kingdom of heaven...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew 5:16-20).</font></p>

<p align="center">JUDAISM DEMANDS ALL OF MAN--THE WHOLE MAN </p>
<p align="center">by Rabbi Isaac Gottlieb</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Simon the Just used to say, &quot;The world stands on these Three pillars: 
    Torah, worship, and the practice of loving kindness.&quot; Bertinoro (a commentary) 
    reads: &quot;The world was created <i>bishvil</i>, for the sake of the above 
    three principles.&quot; These three principles are, in reality, the fundamental 
    criteria of the Jewish faith. They shape and perfect the world of man and 
    all that pertains to it.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore Love is the fulfilling 
      of the Law...</i>(Romans 13:10).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Rabbi Yisrael Lipshutz, author of the classic commentary <i>Tifereth Yisrael</i>, 
    helps us gain a marvelous insight into the <i>tachlit</i> (purpose) of man, 
    the goal of all creation. &quot;If we are prudent in these three values, this 
    world and the World to Come will have <i>kiyyum</i>, endurance. The ultimate 
    goal of man on this earth is to achieve <i>shleimut</i>, or wholeness.</p>
  <p>&quot;Wholeness can be realized by means of these Three principles. First, 
    man's obligation to himself is to collect Torah knowledge, for all is contained 
    in it. Second, his duty to G-d is his observance of <i>mitzvot</i>. Third, 
    the obligation to his fellow man is the practice of <i>chesed </i>or benevolance. 
    If these are fulfilled, man will be spiritually elevated in both worlds.&quot; 
    (see <i>Pirkei Avot </i>1:2).</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>For the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, 
      goodness, faith,</i></p>
    <p><i>Meekness, temperence: against such there is no law...</i>(Galatians 
      5:22,23).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The <i>Gaon Harev </i>Yechiel Michel Tykocinski writes in his <i>Gesher Hachayyim</i>: 
    &quot;The more one studies the Torah, the more one will understand its infinite 
    wisdom.&quot; Even if one lived 1,000 years and studied day and night one 
    would never reach its end. Nevertheless, all can gain possession of it. The 
    Sages declared (<i>Yoma </i>72; <i>Rambam, Laws of Torah Study, </i>Ch 3) 
    that whether one is wise or not, he can, in accord with the level of his comprehension 
    and the nature given him by his Creator, acquire his share in the Torah...</p>
  <p>Torah teaches man what function he is to fulfill, what he is to do during 
    his brief existence so that he can attain the enduring, true life. All the 
    knowledge and science in the world do no more than teach the mechanics of 
    living. The Torah not only teaches how to live, but what to live for...The 
    Torah in its totality is designed to teach the Way of life...</p>
  <p>The Malbim, in his brilliance, puts it in useful perspective. THE PURPOSE 
    OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD WILL BE REALIZED WHEN BROUGHT TO COMPLETION...

    36:14-17).</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">When Moses came down from The Mountain of Human Comprehension 
    we are told that he brought two tables of the Testimony with him, written 
    <i>on one side and on the other</i>. These were not two stone tablets with 
    five commandments inscribed on either side as is so commonly depicted, but 
    the two traditions of the Law that have come down to us known as the Written 
    Tradition and the Oral Tradition, or, as Paul expressed it, <i>The Letter 
    of the Law</i> and <i>the Spirit of the Law. </i>(2 Corinthians 3:1-6). Moses 
    engraved the one in stone, (figuratively), and passed it down to the world 
    as an Oracle. An Oracle is the Word of God, conveyed through certain human 
    mediums, (the ancient lawgivers and Sibyls), and interpreted by others, (the 
    seers and prophets), delivered at certain times and places, in response to 
    certain human inquiries, whose meanings are intentionally devised to thwart 
    the mind of Darkness, dividing it at last from the mind of Light. (See Matthew 
    13:10-18). The one would be denied access to its concealed meanings, revealing 
    itself in the end, while the latter would gain direct access to them by virtue 
    of the alignment of its own heart and mind, and its desire for the inner meaning 
    of things, and for the Law itself. Moses, (the spirit of the Lawgiver which 
    has been with us up to this very time), discovered this means of legislation, 
    not only from the ancient priests and shamans, (the Sibyls and Rishis of old--receiving, 
    as it were, the Law from the hands of angels), but through his (and her) own 
    deepened and heightened sense of the Hidden Nature of Divine Reality. As God 
    had both concealed and revealed Themselves (They are ONE) in the outer garments 
    of Their own created order, so Moses, who had discovered Their Divine Presence 
    in all the events of his time, as well as in the entire History of world events, 
    likewise learned to hide the true, underlying meanings of the Torah in the 
    outer garments, or in the written<i> Letter</i> of the Torah itself. And unlike 
    the laws of the nations and empires round about him--all of which have been 
    destroyed in succession by the God of History, as a result of their contact 
    with (or rather their conscription of) the Oracles of God--the precepts of 
    Moses were committed to the Universal Israel whose destiny was to walk a path 
    through the midst of all these nations, until it appeared at the end of the 
    age, and in the midst of all these Divine judgments, fully perfected in the 
    Universal Law, inheritors not only of every hidden meaning of things but of 
    the age to come, and the worlds above.</font></p>

      almost all our constitution depends on the wisdom of Moses, our legislator, 
      I cannot avoid saying somewhat concerning him beforehand...I mean, because 
      otherwise those who read my book may wonder how it comes to pass that my 
      discourse which promises an account of laws and historical facts, contains 
      so much of philosophy. The reader is therefore to know, that Moses deemed 
      it exceedingly necessary that he who would conduct his own life well, and 
      give laws to others, IN THE FIRST PLACE SHOULD CONSIDER THE DIVINE NATURE, 
      AND UPON CONTEMPLATION OF GOD'S OPERATIONS SHOULD IMITATE THE BEST OF ALL 
      PATTERNS, so far as it is possible for human nature to do so, and to endeavor 
      to follow after it; neither could the legislator himself have a right mind 
      without such contemplation; nor would anything he should write tend to the 
      promotion of virtue in his readers...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Now when 
      Moses was desirous to teach this lesson to his countrymen, he did not begin 
      the establishment of his laws after the same manner as other legislators 
      did: I mean upon contracts and other rites between one man and another, 
      but by raising their minds upwards to regard God, and his creation of the 
      world...I exhort, therefore, my readers to examine the whole undertaking 
      in that view; for thereby it will appear to them that there is nothing therein 
      disagreeable either to the majesty of God, or to His love for mankind; for

  <p><font size="+1">After Moses passed these methods, along with the original 
    tables of the Law itself, down along that line on the Tree of Life that would 
    come in time to define the life of Judaism as we know it today, he took the 
    mind of Israel aside, saying: Now THAT is what is written, but THIS is what 
    is meant. Moses expounded the secret and epic meanings of the written law, 
    and the underlying explanation of each statute and precept. These meanings 
    were then committed to Aaron and his &quot;sons,&quot; (through the tribe 
    of Levi), and passed down along that line on the Tree of Life that leads from 
    the time of Aaron (via Joshua, the elders and the prophets) to the time of 
    John the Baptist (and Paul), and finally to those who are presently gathered 
    around the Left Foot of the Mystery here at the Western ends of the earth, 
    at the place named Netseh, or Endurance, as it is still written: <i>For Levi 
    shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law...</i>(Deuteronomy 33:8-11).

  <p><font size="+1">Thus, in order to maintain the succession of <i>Keepers</i> 
    on the Judaic side of the Tree of Life, (as Guardians of the Written Law, 
    so that the sacred Torah itself would not get lost and obscured in all of 
    its own epic meanings), the Spirit set aside a remnant of Jews in that time, 
    as it is also written: <i><font size="+1">No man having drunk old wine straightaway 
    desireth new, for he saith the old is better...</font></i><font size="+1">(Luke 
    5:39).</font> Its commission in fact, in addition to preserving the Law intact, 
    was to resist those forms of apostasy that were about to come to power, and 
    eventually to fruition, in the Christian mysteries, as Paul himself said: 
    <i>For the Mystery of Iniquity doth already work, </i>(2 Thessalonians 2:7), 
    and as John wrote:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">Little children, it is the last time, and as ye have 
      heard that anti-christ shall come, even now there are many anti-christs; 
      whereby we know that it is the last time.</font></i></p>

      they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not of us...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
      John 2:18,19).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">This Jewish remnant was not only charged with building a 
    fence around the Torah, which it did with Mishna and Gemara, (the Talmud), 
    but it was also charged with the responsibility of staying inside that fence 
    until the times were full. To come out, only part way, without coming out 
    to the fullest meanings of the Law itself, (<i>For LOVE is the fulfilling 
    of the whole Law</i>), would be to put oneself in harm's way, and in the pathway 
    of the Karmic forces of history, especially as they culminated in all of the 
    events (in the great Whirlwind) of the 20th century. Thus Moses wrote: <i>Oh 
    that we were wise, that we understood this, that we would consider our latter 
    end. </i>(Deuteronomy 32:29).</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">(1) Moses received 
      Torah from Sinai and delivered it to Joshua, </font><font size="+1">(the 
      great archetype of the Christian mysteries)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">, 
      and Joshua to the Elders, and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets 
      delivered it to the Men of the Great Synagogue. These said three things; 
      Be deliberate in judging, and raise up many disciples, AND MAKE A HEDGE 
      FOR THE TORAH.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">(1) It is a fundamental axiom of Rabbinical Judaism that 
      the tradition, of which the subject matter was the Torah, began with Moses 
      to whom it was committed on Sinai. The compiler of <i>Aboth</i>, however, 
      had no need to dwell upon the earlier stages in the history of the tradition, 
      where in a sense all was common ground. <font size="3">(Where in reality 
      all was being concealed)</font>. The Elders and the Prophets belonged to 
      all Israel. But the Great Synagogue, <font size="3">(or the Greater Holy 
      Assembly as it was later alluded to in the Zohar)</font>, as that term was 
      used in Rabbinical Judaism, marked the beginning of a new development; for 
      it was historically the ancestors of Pharisaism...</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">The real interest of the compiler would be to trace the 
      succession of the teachers in the Pharisaic line, and he indicated the special 
      importance of this line by citing ethical or religious maxims attributed 
      to the teachers whom he named, beginning with the Men of the Great Synagogue. 
      These teachers, down to Hillel or possibly Johanan ben Zaccai, may be supposed 
      to be the persons referred to in the name <i>Aboth; </i>these are preeminently 
      the &quot;Fathers&quot; of the tradition.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">The Great Synagogue, for historical purposes, may be taken 
      to represent those who followed the lead of Ezra in developing the religion 
      of Torah. An idea of an assembly is based on the statement in Neh. IX and 
      X...The evidence <font size="3">(however)</font> is not sufficient to afford 
      a definite answer to the question of the constitution or even the existence 
      of a specific body called the Great Synagogue. But it is reasonable to suppose 
      that there must have been some kind of teaching body, whose authority would 
      be exercised on the lines of the school of Ezra and would be accepted by 
      members of that school...The <i>Zugoth</i>, or Pairs of teachers who are 
      named in this first chapter of <i>Aboth, </i>and who are elsewhere said 
      to have held the offices respectively of <i>Nasi </i>and <i>Ab Beth Din</i> 
      of the Sanhedrin, certainly did not hold these offices in the political 
      Sanhedrin; but it is not impossible, that they may have held the presidency 
      in some assembly constituted on Pharisaic lines.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+1">The chronology of the period is very obscure. The date 
      of Ezra is 444 B.C. or thereabouts. Simeon the Just is one of two men of 
      whom the older was High Priest from B.C. 310 to 291...and the younger (grandson 
      of the elder) was High Priest from B.C. 219 to 199. Josephus mentions both...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">(2) Simeon the Just 
      was of the survivors of the Great Synagogue. He used to say: Upon three 
      things the world standeth; upon Torah, upon Worship and upon the showing 
      of kindness. </font><i>Aboth</i>, The Ethics of the Talmud, Sayings of the 
      Fathers, by R. Travers Herford, pp.19-22<font size="+1">.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">The chronology of the period is very obscure indeed, and 
    so are the historical details associated with it, (or more specifically, the 
    absense of such details), whose loosely scattered records were eventually 
    compiled by Rabbi Judah during the closing years of the second century A.D., 
    giving a more definitive form to the Judaism that we recognize in our own 
    times. Five hundred years had elapsed between the time of Simeon the Just 
    and the compilation of the <i>Mishna</i>, of which <i>Aboth</i> formed a most 
    integral part. This span of centuries, from about the time of Alexander the 
    Great to Rabbi Judah, were sufficient enough, not only to give birth to Christianity 
    but to literally seal up these mysteries (with Seven Seals) from the eyes 
    of the entire world, leaving everyone, (including the later followers of Christianity 
    itself), to their own religious devices, to their own abilities or inabilities 
    to unravel the historical puzzle that was left to them. Yet Rabbinic Judaism 
    was also provided with a footing, a foundation to build upon as it were, in 
    its emerging connection to the doctrines of the Tree of Life and the <i>Merkabah 
    </i>mysteries that were being passed on to it. As in Christianity, those whose 
    hearts were closer to God would come closer to the meaning of it all. Those 
    whose hearts became fixed and rigid, either towards Judaism on the one side, 
    or Christianity on the other, remained in darkness and oblivious to events. 
    Those who found themselves in possession of even parts of the puzzle, for 
    safekeeping as it were, passing them down as they both received and understood 
    them, gave rise to the many various and intertwined schools of Gnostic and 
    Kabbalistic thought that grew up out of those times--along with the entire 
    succession of rabbis who wittingly or otherwise went inside the fence to immerse 
    themselves in Talmud-Torah and in time, in the doctrines of Kabbalah again...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">What was hidden from everyone, nonetheless, was the realization 
    that this Great Synagogue, or Great Assembly, never existed in Palestine at 
    all, and that this Simeon the Just, the High Priest of Israel, never officiated 
    in any temple in that land either. The fact of it gives rise to the noted 
    controversy among biblical scholars and historians as to the reliability of 
    those accounts which have Alexander the Great taking this famous aside from 
    his march on Egypt, in order to visit what was at that time a most obscure 
    and backwater city in the lower heights of Syria, (our present-day Jerusalem), 
    whereupon it was said that he encountered the High Priest of Israel coming 
    down to meet him, regaled in majesty and splendour:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his 
      life repaired the house again, and in his days fortified the temple:</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">And by him was built from the Foundation the Double 
      Height, the high fortress of the Wall about the temple, </font></i><font size="3">(the

    <p><i><font size="+1">In his days the cistern to receive water, being in compass 
      as the Sea, was covered with plates of brass: </font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">He took care of the temple that it should not fall, 
      and fortified the city against beseiging </font></i><font size="3">(by helping 
      to hide its whereabouts)</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">How was he honoured in the midst of the people IN HIS 
      COMING OUT OF THE SANCTUARY.</font></i></p>

  <p><font size="+1">This Simeon, it turns out to be, was the Druid High Priest 
    who did indeed came down out of the hidden Sanctuary of Israel to meet Alexander 
    who was coming up into Europe in pursuit of conquest. Alexander's general, 
    Ptolemy, has preserved an account of the event in his own writings:</font></p>

      they set up their own standards on the edge of the river and spread the 
      news that a Macedonian prince had advanced to the extreme northern frontier 
      of the Greek world and meant to keep it. This message must have counted 
      as something of a sensation.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>There came from all corners, 
      barbarian chiefs to visit the young man challenging them in their own sphere. 
      One even came from the upper Danube, and his visit won him a place, albeit, 
      anonymous, in history. Alexander probably received him with special curiosity. 
      As a reader of Herodotus he was well aware that 'the Danube rises in the 
      land of the Celts'. The man thus belonged to a people about whom he must

      hope that he would reply it was himself.' But the answer was unexpected. 
      The Celt tersely replied that they feared nothing so much as the possibility 
      'THAT THE HEAVENS MIGHT FALL ON THEIR HEADS.' His words must have impressed

      a people of remarkable rashness. Modern scholars have puzzled over this 
      enigmatic reply...This in turn leads one to suppose that the Celt had uttered

  <p><font size="+1">It was the recollection of this same encounter that prompted 
    Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, to send once again into that land to bring scholars 
    to Alexandria, in order to translate the Torah out of its native script into 
    the Greek language. This translation, called the Septuagint, (the LXX),, which 
    the rabbis were to reject, provided the early church its means of disemminating 
    the Judeao-Christian mysteries into the world at large. And it was this intertestament 
    period of several hundred years that provided the Spirit with Her opportunity 
    to have these mysteries pass out of one land into another, out of Europe into 
    the East, and then back again, without being noticed by those who were overly 
    attached to the literal interpretation of things, and who considered Christianity 
    to be an aberration and a violation of the precepts of the Torah, rather than 
    its fulfilling. Of course Kabbalah was the key to it all, as Paul said:</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">The great paradox is, that the very God of War who revealed 
    himself to Moses, and then again in the time of Christ, will reveal Himself 
    to none but children of perfect peace, (Matthew 5). All others who call themselves 
    by the Divine Name will perish because of unbelief and disobedience, as this 
    same God rises up now in all of the events of our time to cast His sickle 
    across the face of the Western world. Likewise, Judaism was not only supposed 
    to resist the great historical transgressions that have come to pass in Christianity, 
    even to the death if need be, which it largely did, but it was to stand in 
    dire opposition to those heresies and trangressions that would emerge from 
    the Jewish side of reality as well. The 20th century notion of a Zionist state 
    in Palestine is the most glaring example...For with His Strong Right Arm the 
    Lord shall judge the West, but with His Left Arm, the Arm of Islam, God will 
    cleanse the East of error and oppression as well:</font></p>

      ruler of my city has ordered me to kill a certain person, and if I refuse 
      he will kill me.&quot; Raba told him, &quot;Be killed and do not kill; do

      yours.&quot;'&quot; (Pes. 25b). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyman's

  <p><font size="+1">However, because Judaism as a religious institution (in the 
    absense of prophet and Messiah) has come instead to be based upon the &quot;democratic&quot; 
    principles of opinion and response--one view of reality and another, one interpretation 
    and of the Law and another--Raba's response to the young man was not, and 
    is not binding on all Jews, in all times and in all situations, as it is on 
    all Christians. (A Christian is not allowed to kill another under any circumstance...and 
    this according to the very highest and most sublime meanings of the Torah 
    itself). Raba, in this case, reached over to the other side of the Tree and 
    gave a purely Christian (Levitical) response to a dilemma that touches every 
    soul at some time or another in its own lifetime. Yet, almost always, (and 
    particularly here in these times), in moments of personal crisis, the Jewish 
    impulse &quot;to live&quot; has circumscribed the Christian commandment &quot;to 
    die.&quot; (The one being ordained to survive and accompany the Messiahs into 
    the age to come, [Isaiah 4:1,2], and the other being ordained, <i>as sheep 
    for the slaughter</i>, not only to close the door on this present Christian 
    age but to shed the light of the Law itself upon the extreme and overspreading 
    Darkness of these times). As a result the commandment <i>Thou shalt not kill</i>, 
    has been rationalized over time by many of the rabbis to mean: <i>Thou shalt 
    not murder</i>. While this subtle twisting and diminishing of the precept 
    still tries to prohibit killing as an aggressive act (despite the Law's literal 
    commandment to utterly slay and kill every single inhabitant that stands in 
    the way between a Jew and the Promised Land... Deuteronomy 7), it allows the 
    shedding of human blood, even premeditatively, for various other &quot;practical&quot; 
    reasons including acts of self-defense, (which, of course, betrays one's disbelief 
    in the Unity of God's Presence in all matters), and has led directly to all 
    of the judgments that have fallen upon the children of Israel in the 20th 
    century, and which are about to befall the Zionist State of Israel (as well 
    as the Zionist Empire of America) as this age ends and the new begins, as 
    it is also written:</font></p>
