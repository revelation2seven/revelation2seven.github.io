      hath met with us: let us go we pray thee, Three day's journey into the desert, 
      and sacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence 
      and the sword.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye...let

      5:1-4).</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="+1">THE MYSTIC MOSES</font></p>
    <p align="left">Moses now begins to shepherd the flock of Jethro...The flocks 
      which represent the thoughts and commands of the bad shepherd, have to be 
      put in order by Moses, led into Justice. His relation to Jethro is like 
      Jacob's to Laban, but is much better a type of the way in which the Good 
      Shepherd will come and shepherd our flock. The allegory is an extended one 
      of the divine power of salvation, and the divine care God exercises for 
      those who come to him.</p>
    <p align="left">The experience at the burning bush is variously explained. 
      In one passage Moses seems to be attempting as a man to solve the principle 
      of cosmic causation when he approaches the burning bush with his shoes on. 
      He is warned off the Holy ground of causation by God who has reserved knowledge 
      of this for divine natures...</p>
    <p align="left">With his vision of God thus clarified, and with the practical 
      assistance of Aaron,Moses now goes to Egypt to begin his great work. He 
      returns to Pharaoh to struggle with him and ultimately destroy him. Pharaoh 
      represents all that is bad (or subtle) in human nature, a lover of pleasure...and 
      hence, with Egypt his country, represents the body in its worst form.</p>
    <p align="left">Captive in this country is the mind &quot;fond of seeing,&quot; 
      Israel, which at this stage is rather the mind &quot;capable of seeing.&quot; 
      The mind must be led out of Egypt if it is to get the vision; and it is 
      Moses who, with Aaron, has the power to do this for man's higher nature. 
      The salvation he brings the Israelites is one &quot;where the helping principle 
      of its own accord comes wholly from the outside to shield us after our own 
      faculties have been quite destroyed.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">As the people are thus united in one great collective act 
      of migration they are made one; from being a multitude, or a tribe, or a 
      people, they become an &quot;ecclesia,&quot; a church, united not so much 
      in body as in mind, intent, and spirit. The Passover is held at evening 
      because of the significance of evening, the time of the fading of the material 
      light at the coming of immaterial illumination....</p>
    <p align="left">In another passage Pharaoh is the king of the lower bodily 
      mind in revolt against God. Not only is the mind engrossed in the complicated 
      structure of pleasure, but it takes the higher mind, with all its possibilities 
      of vision, and enslaves it. The higher mind groans heavily at this subjection 
      and cries to God the only Saviour. In answer God commands, &quot;Send forth 
      the people that they may serve me.&quot; They type of service to which He 
      calls them is not a menial one; it consists in going up to the aetherial 
      heights with their reasonings, setting them before Moses, the type of existence 
      beloved of God, to lead them on their way. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BY
