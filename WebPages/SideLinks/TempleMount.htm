  <P><i>Because of our sins we were exiled from our country and banished from 
    our land. We cannot go up as pilgrims to worship Thee, to perform our duties 
    in Thy chosen house, the great and Holy Temple which was called by Thy name, 
    on account of the hand that was let loose on Thy sanctuary. May it be Thy

  the Jewish prayer area. The Dome of the Rock is especially beautiful because 
  of the recent addition of new gold leaf to the anodized aluminum dome. The traditional 
  location of the First and Second Temples lies in the immediate vicinity of the 
  Dome of the Rock. The proposed Northern site for the Temples is to the top left 
  of the Dome. The southern Site for the Temples lies midway between the Dome 
  of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosque, under an Islamic ablution fountain known as 
  El Kas. The level of the bedrock of Mount Moriah outcrops within the Dome of 
  the Rock and is just beneath the paving stones of the surrounding platform. 
  However, to the south the bedrock drops steeply towards the City of David and 
  the junction of Hinnom and Kidron Valleys. </font>(continued)...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b>The Eastern (Golden) Gate. The gate is metaphorically shut

    years ago on <i>his </i>way to the Western ends of the earth and the fulness

<p align="center"></p>
<p><font size="+1">We make the assumption here that the reader has already encountered 
  the great Dragon (the Leviathan), and has read at least some of the pertinent 
  chapters leading up to this treatise on the Temple Mount, and therefore that 
  they are already familiar with our Kabbalistic interpretation of history, which 
  holds that immediately after the time of Moses the mind of Israel left this 
  land and followed the spirit of Jehoshua back up into Europe, and back to that 
  place that was hidden all these centuries from the eyes of the world, there 
  at the center of the Universal Oracle, at the place named Beauty on the Tree 
  of Life. (It is an epic story--a script which could only have been written in 
  heaven--which foreshadowed in literary types and divine images, those things 
  that would comet to pass a second time, and which have been unfolding in the 
  earth over the last two thousand years). And thus, that this exile from Jerusalem 
  occurred centuries before the time of Christianity, when <i>Ephraim went backwards 
  </i> the first time. (Open the Book of Hosea the prophet). The warriors of Ephraim 
  rejected Judah and the City of David in those ancient times and, following historical 
  forces away from the center of Israel's own mysteries, returned to that land 
  beyond the Hellespont, and eventually pushed their way back to that city in 
  the East (in Egypt)--the city that Moses built a thousand years earlier as an 
  image, and a replica in stone-below, of the Great City that God would build 
  over time in the worlds above.</font></p>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Temple Mount: Site of the Ancient 
  Jewish Temples</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Temple Mount in the Old City 
  of Jerusalem measures today approximately 45 acres in extent. It is surrounded 
  by a trapezoidal wall: The south wall measures about 910 feet, the North about 
  1025, the east wall about 1520 and the west wall about 1580 feet in length. 
  The average height above sea level on the platform is about 2400 feet above 
  sea level. Most of the buildings and surface features are Islamic - NO VISIBLE 
  TRACE OF THE FIRST OR SECOND TEMPLES CAN BE FOUND ON THE PLATFORM TODAY. </font>(For 
  the very simple reason that they were never there to begin with)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.The 
  area is park-like in its settings with plants of trees and shrubs and many ancient 
  buildings and monuments added over the past 1300 years of Moslem stewardship 
  of the site. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The present-day platform area of 
  the Temple Mount lies topographically just below the peak of a Jerusalem ridge 
  system known as Mount Moriah. This is the site David purchased from a Jebusite 
  named Ornan late in his reign. King David prepared the area in order build a 
  permanent House of God to replace the Tabernacle of Moses ...WHICH ACCOMPANIED 
  THE JEWS AFTER THEIR EXODUS FROM EGYPT TO THE PROMISED LAND...</font></P>
<p><font size="+1">That land in the Middle east is n</font><font size="+1">ot 
  the <i> Promised Land</i>. It is, however, that place in the world to which 
  the spirit of Elijah descended, from the higher Mount Carmel centuries later, 
  to say:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thus saith the Lord, HAST THOU KILLED, AND ALSO TAKEN 
    POSSESSION?....</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Kings 21:17-29).</font><i><font size="+1"> 
    </font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ...David had the plans drawn up 
  for a building whose dimensions were twice those of the Tabernacle, and he amassed 
  great quantities of building materials: stone, cedar, and much gold and silver. 
  However, IT WAS SOLOMON HIS SON WHO ACTUALLY BUILT THE FIRST JEWISH TEMPLE (1 
  Chronicles 22:14-15, 28:11-20).</font></P>
<P align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg29a.gif" width="400" height="427"></P>
<P align="center"><b>This is Solomon's Temple...Matthew, chapter 24 (KJV)</b></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ridge system where the Temple 
  Mount is now located is believed by many reputable sources to be the site where 
  Abraham was told to sacrifice Isaac (Genesis 22:1-2). While Solomon built the 
  First Temple about 3000 years ago, Abraham's visit to Mt. Moriah was about a 
  thousand years earlier.</font></P>

</blockquote>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consecrated Ground</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Rabbinical sources both 
  the First and Second Temples were built on the same foundations, at the same 
  location somewhere on the Temple Mount. The site had to be consecrated ground 
  THAT HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY USED FOR TOMBS and that was not a previous pagan 
  worship site ("high place"). The innermost sanctuary of the Temple, the Holy 
  of Holies, or Kodesh Hakodeshim, where the Ark of the Covenant was placed, MARKED 
  THE EXACT CENTER OF THE WORLD, and was the innermost zone in holiness or sanctity 
  in Jewish thought. The manifest presence of God, the Shekinah, was centered 
  between the cherubim of the Ark and especially noted at the dedication of the 
  First Temple---</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Solomon had ended his prayer, 
  fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, 
  AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE TEMPLE. And the priests could not enter 
  the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD's house. 
  When all the children of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the 
  LORD upon the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the earth on the pavement, 
  and worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, "For he is good, for his 
  steadfast love endures for ever." (2 Chronicles 7:1-3)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moving outwards from the Holy of 
  Holies one came to The Holy Place, and then to the Courts of the priests, and 
  of the women and of the Jewish people, then the Court of the Gentiles, and so 
  on, out into the world in decreasing degrees of holiness....</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both ancient Jewish Temples are of 
  interest to Christians as well as to Jews. The Second Temple was modest in size 
  and furnishing until Herod the Great began his grand remodeling plans which 
  continued for 40 years. It was in this enlarged and expanded Second Jewish Temple 
  and its grand courts where the naming and circumcision of Jesus took place (Luke 
  2:21-39). Later, Jesus astonished the religious leaders with his understanding 
  and insight as a twelve-year-old boy (Luke 2:41-50). On two separate occasions 
  Jesus entered and cleansed the temple by throwing out the money changers and 
  commercial vendors from the courts. (John 2:12-25; Matthew 21:23-26)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In one of his final discussions with 
  his disciples (Matthew 24), Jesus predicted the destruction of the Second Temple. 
  It was in fact leveled to the ground on the 9th day of the month of Av in 70 
  C.E. The temple was thoroughly razed and the site has been so extensively modified 
  during the late Roman, Moslem and Crusader eras THAT CONSIDERABLE DOUBT EXISTS 
  AS TO WHERE THE TEMPLES ACTUALLY STOOD. </font>(Exactly)!</P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
  Map of the Temple Mount Today. Where did the Temple stand? </font><b>(It's a 
  mystery)</b></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the numerous controversies 
  about the Temple is the precise location of the original. There are three primary 
  conjectures under active discussion in recent years. These three areas of interest 
  on the Temple Mount have been the focus of intense investigation, much debate 
  and discussion, and growing controversy. Behind many of these discussions lie 
  serious plans by a number of Orthodox Jewish groups for the building of a Third 
  Jewish Temple on the site when political conditions will permit this. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary areas on the Temple Mount 
  which are seriously discussed in regard to the actual location of the First 
  and Second Jewish Temples are: The present site of the Dome of the Rock. This 
  is the so-called "traditional location." There are two variations on this model. 
  North of the Dome of the Rock. Physicist Asher Kaufman proposed the Northern 
  location about two decades ago. South of the Dome of the Rock. Tuvia Sagiv, 
  a Tel Aviv architect, has proposed a Southern location for the Temples with 
  extensive documentation and research during the past five years. <BR>
  </font></P>
<P></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Traditional Site</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The traditional site of the Temple 
  is said to lie beneath or very near to the Moslem shrine known as the Dome of 
  the Rock. Certain historical accounts say that this building was built by the 
  Moslems to overlay the location of the original Jewish Temple(s) and most rabbis 
  in Israel today associate the original Temple location with this site. Dr. Leen 
  Ritmeyer has researched and written on the original 500 cubit square boundaries 
  of the original Temple Mount site based on this assumption. Recent journal articles 
  still support this view. (1) Former Jerusalem District archaeologist Dr. Dan 
  Bahat vigorously defends the traditional location - drawing on his years of 
  experience and study of the entire city and its history. His lectures on the 
  subject are thorough, convincing and captivating. However, so also are the alternative 
  theories currently proposed! </font></P>
<P></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
  Traditional Site of the Temples: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  Northern Conjecture</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on a number of topological 
  and archeological considerations, research by Dr. Asher Kaufman over the past 
  two decades has resulted in serious consideration being given to a site 330 
  feet to the north of the Dome of the Rock. The Mt. Moriah bedrock outcrops within 
  the Dome of Rock, as is well known. Although the bedrock elevation drops sharply 
  to the south in the direction of the City of David, the level of the bedrock 
  is just beneath the paving stones for over 100 meters to the North of the Dome 
  of the Rock shrine. One particular level outcropping of this bedrock lies under 
  a small Islamic shrine known as "The Dome of the Tablets" or "The Dome of the 
  Spirits," to the Arabs. Both names suggest an association with the Jewish Temples. 
  It is under this small, unimpressive canopy supported by pillars that Dr. Kaufman 
  locates the Temple site. (2) </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Southern Conjecture</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many people who have been following 
  these developments may not yet be aware of a third view, which might well be 
  called "the Southern Conjecture." Since this model is less well known, it will 
  be more fully described here and on these web pages. This view has been championed 
  in the past five years by Tuvia Sagiv, a prominent Israeli architect. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
  are a number of problems with each of the previously mentioned locations. To 
  fully appreciate some of the difficulties, it is necessary to visualize the 
  topography of the Temple Mount area. </font></P>
<P></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">North is at the top of the map. The 
  Mount of Olives is on the far right, Mount Zion on the left. Mount Moriah rises 
  as a long ridge at the south end of the City of David and continues on past 
  the present Temple Mount, and reaches its highest point outside the Northern 
  walls of the Old City, at the top of the map. The bedrock rises when going northward 
  from the base of the City of David to highest ground north of the Temple Mount 
  area. (This is obscured on site since the Temple Mount Platform itself is a 
  large flat area surrounded by retaining wall.) The southern end of the Platform 
  is actually built up on tall underground pillars and arches. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the east of the Temple Mount lies 
  the Kidron Valley, and the Mount of Olives. To the south, the City of David 
  and the Hinnom Valley. To the west, the famed Western Wall (called in earlier 
  times the "Wailing Wall"). To the north of the Temple site was the Roman military 
  Antonia Fortress, and then, further, the high ground outside the city walls, 
  WHICH MANY BELIEVE was the site of Golgotha. The bedrock of Mt. Moriah continues 
  to rise to the north - outcroppings in the Northern wall reveal road cuts that 
  have been made in the bedrock at the North end of the Old City outside the Damascus 
  Gate and along the main road to the east. The crest of Mt. Moriah is just above 
  the present Garden Tomb. </font></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critical Issues in Locating the Temple 
  Site: When one compiles all the known factors into a three-dimensional computer 
  model of the Temple Mount area, several problems emerge: </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Where was the Antonia Fortress? 
  Ancient Jerusalem was protected on the east, south, and west by valleys. The 
  Antonia Fortress was located to the north to protect the weaker north side of 
  the city. (In fact, it was from the north that Titus Vespasian breached the 
  walls in his famous attack in 70 C.E.)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to ancient sources, the 
  fortress was on a hill about 25 meters high. The current El Omriah school building 
  is on a rock only 5 meters high. From many stratographic and other considerations 
  it is doubted by some experts that his was the actual location of the Antonia 
  Fortress. Tuvia Sagiv's papers discuss the critical issue of the actual location 
  of the Fortress Antonia, which he believes was well to the south, perhaps at 
  the location of the Dome of the Rock. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The Location of the Ancient North 
  Moat (the Fosse). Traditional renderings show a deep, filled-in fosse (moat), 
  north of the Temple Mount, lying south of the Antonia Fortress, between the 
  fortress and the Temple Mount. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According 
  to ancient sources, however, the Antonia Fortress and the Temple Mount were 
  adjacent to each other. The moat should be to the north of the Tower for protection, 
  placing the Antonia about where the Dome of the Rock stands today! Asher Kaufman's 
  location of the Temples places the moat immediately to the North of the spot 
  where the Temples stood. In fact, Dan Bahat jokes that Kaufman's temple would 
  "fall into the moat!" </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. The Hulda Gates: The Hulda Gates 
  were the primary access to the Temple area from the south. According to the 
  Mishna, the difference in heights between the Hulda Gates and the Holy of the 
  Holies was approximately 10 meters, with about 39 m between the entrance to 
  the Temple mount and the level of the Temple itself. The traditional Dome of 
  the Rock proposals require 20 meters and 80 m separations. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  current assumptions regarding Hulda Gate tunnels are not mentioned in the ancient 
  sources. The discrepancies suggest a lower, and therefore, more southerly, location. 
  Tuvia Sagiv in his essays discusses the problem of the Southern Gates and their 
  elevation with respect to the Temples. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. The View from the North: Josephus 
  Flavius </font>(an eventual adept of the Christian mysteries)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  describes the fact that the Bizita Hill (Golgotha?) WAS LOCATED NORTH OF THE 
  TEMPLE MOUNT AND OBSCURED THE VIEW OF THE TEMPLE FROM THE NORTH. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
  the Temple stood at the Dome of the Rock, it would be visible from as far away 
  as the town of Ramallah. In order to obscure the view from the north, it would 
  have to be at a lower level, that is, to the south. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. King Herod Agrippa's View of the 
  Temple from the West: Josephus, in The Jewish Wars, describes the fact that 
  King Herod Agrippa could look out from his Hasmonean Palace (at or near the 
  present Citadel at the Jaffa Gate), and view the sacrifices at the Azarah, at 
  the altar of the Second Temple. This incensed the Jews, who then built a wall 
  extending the height of the western rear wall of the Temple proper in order 
  to block the view. Roman soldiers, patrolling the western threshold - thus unable 
  to view the Azarah - demanded that the wall be demolished. The Jews objected, 
  and even obtained the consent of Emperor Nero to leave the wall in place.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the Temple were at the location 
  of the Dome of the Rock, it would have required a Palace tower height of 75 
  meters to view into the Azarah. THERE NEVER WAS A BUILDING OF SUCH A HEIGHT 
  IN JERUSALEM. This all implies a lower, more southern location of the Temple. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. The Jerusalem Water Aqueduct from 
  the Judean Hills: The water canals that supplied Jerusalem began in the area 
  of the Hebron mountains, passed through the Solomon's Pools near Bethlehem, 
  and flowed to Jerusalem. The lowest canal reached the Temple Mount through the 
  Jewish Quarter and the Wilson Bridge. According to the ancient authorities, 
  the water conduit supplied water to the High Priests' mikveh (ritual bath) located 
  above the Water Gate, and it also supplied water for the rinsing of the blood 
  off the Azarah. Portions of this aqueduct are plainly visible to this day.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"LIVING WATER," THAT IS, FRESH FLOWING 
  WATER, not water from a cistern, was required for the ritual bath (mikveh) used 
  by the temple priests, and for the washings of the temple in connection with 
  the sacrifices. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A survey of 
  the level of the aqueduct reveals that if the Temple had been located at the 
  same elevation as the present Dome of the Rock shrine, the aqueduct would be 
  over 20 meters too low to serve either the Azarah or the Water Gate. From this 
  survey, it appears that the Temple must have been 20 meters lower, and, thus, 
  to the south. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Electronic Measurements : Preliminary 
  ground penetrating radar probes by Tuvia Sagiv, while not conclusive, suggest 
  vaults, perhaps "kippim" (rabbinical arches), and other structures which one 
  would expect below the Temple, to the south. The northern sites are virtually 
  solid rock. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More recently Sagiv 
  has conducted thermal-infrared scanning of the walls and the platform. During 
  the day the sun heats the Temple Mount uniformly, but at night the cooling (by 
  conduction and radiation) is not uniform, thus revealing subsurface anomalies. 
  In the images shown below, "hotter" areas are bright indicating massive foundations 
  beneath the paving stones. The radar and IR research is discussed in Sagiv's 
  third paper, Penetrating Insights Into the Temple Mount. </font></P>
<P></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nighttime Thermal Infrared Imagery 
  of the Dome of the Rock: These black-and-white images taken from the original 
  false-color IR scanner images clearly reveal a pentagonal ancient foundation 
  under the Dome. These results are discussed by Tuvia Sagiv in his papers.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. Research into Later Roman Temple 
  Architecture: After the Bar Kochba revolt in 132 C.E., the Romans leveled the 
  entire city of Jerusalem and a built a Roman city, Aelia Capitolina, on the 
  ruins. To obliterate any Jewish presence on the Temple Mount, they built a temple 
  to Jupiter on the site. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A similar 
  temple, built by the same builder at about the same time, has been discovered 
  at Baalbek, Lebanon.</font></P>
<P align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/TempleRoman.gif" width="258" height="329"></P>
<P align="center"><b>The Roman Temple at Baalbek, Lebanon</b></P>

  Jewish History on The Temple Mount</font> </P>
<p align="center">Posted: August 06, 2003</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The recent statements of Palestinian leaders warning of &quot;grave consequences&quot; 
    of the &quot;provocative&quot; decision by Israel to allow Jews to visit the 
    Temple Mount are only the latest in a history of attempts by Arab leaders 
    to minimize or deny the historical connection between Jews and the Temple 
    Mount. Arab newspapers and speakers consistently refer to Jewish connections 
    to the Temple Mount as &quot;alleged.&quot; </p>
  <p>HISTORY</p>
  <p>The Temple Mount, which Arabs refer to as the Haram al-Sharif and on which 
    today the Al-Aqsa Mosque is located, is the site on which the biblical King 
    Solomon erected his Temple nearly 1000 years before the Common Era (see I 
    Kings 5:15-7:51). This First Temple was destroyed by the armies of the Babylonian 
    King Nebuchadnezzar in the sixth century BCE, and was replaced by a Second 
    Temple some seventy years later. The Second Temple was destroyed in the year 
    70 C.E. by Roman armies, whose victory was immortalized in the Arch of Titus 
    that may be seen in Rome to this day. Jews have venerated the site of the 
    two Temples and have made pilgrimages there for two thousand years. According 
    to some rabbis, Jewish law prohibits Jews from entering the Temple Mount before 
    undergoing rituals of purification that are not currently practiced; partly 
    as a result of this prohibition, Jews for millennia have prayed at the Western 
    Wall of the Temple Mount, outside the Mount proper. </p>
  <p>&quot;For 34 years [the Israelis] have dug tunnels [around the Temple Mount]&#133;they 
    found not a single stone proving that the Temple of Solomon was there, because 
    historically the Temple was not in Palestine [at all]. They found only remnants 
    of a shrine of the Roman Herod&#133; They are now trying to put in place a 
    number of stones so that they can say 'We were here.' This is nonsense. I 
    challenge them to bring a single stone from the Temple of Solomon.&quot; </p>

  <p>&quot;The claims being made by the rulers of Israel and its rabbis about 
    the alleged Temple are pure fabrications without any base or foundation.&quot;

  <p align="right">Statement by the Higher Islamic Authority of Palestine<br>
    Al-Quds (PA), December 28, 2001<br>
    [Trans. BBC Worldwide Monitoring] </p>
  <p>Sabri: There is not [even] the smallest indication of the existence of a 
    Jewish Temple on this place in the past. In the whole city, there is not even 
    a single stone indicating Jewish history. Our right, on the other hand, is 
    very clear. This place belongs to us for 1500 years. Even when it was conquered 
    by the Crusaders, it remained Al-Aqsa, and we got it back soon afterwards. 
    The Jews do not even know exactly where their Temple stood. Therefore, we 
    do not accept that they have any rights, underneath the surface or above it. 
  </p>
  <p>Die Welt: It is agreed among archeologists that the Wailing-Wall is part 
    of the foundation of Herod's temple. The Bible and other antique sources report 
    about this place in detail. Why can't you respect the Jewish connection to 
    this place? </p>
  <p>Sabri: It is the art of the Jews to deceive the world. But they can't do 
    it to us. There is not a single stone in the Wailing-Wall relating to Jewish 
    History. The Jews cannot legitimately claim this wall, neither religiously 
    nor historically. The Committee of the League of Nations recommended in 1930, 
    to allow the Jews to pray there, in order to keep them quiet. But by no means 
    did it acknowledge that the wall belongs to them. </p>
  <p>Die Welt: Why don't you allow Israeli scientists to dig there to look for 
    possible remnants and proofs for or against the existence of the Jewish temple? 
  </p>
  <p>Sabri: We categorically reject all excavations under the Al-Aqsa mosque, 
    because they would endanger the historical buildings on the site. Besides, 
    they have already dug everywhere. All they could find were remnants of buildings 
    from the Omayyad-period. Everything they excavated was related to Arabs and 
    Muslims. </p>

    the Armenians' property and churches, because these are integral parts of

    since the issuance of Umar's Covenant. He noted that it was the Shore phonetic 
    Committee which allowed the Jews to pray in that place. He said that Al-Buraq

    prayers there, because it was not proven yet that the temple is located there.&quot;

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today a visitor can enter the Old 
  City of Jerusalem by one OF SEVEN GATES. Some gates were named by location. 
  The Jaffa Gate faces West towards Tel Aviv and Joppa. The Damascus Gate is in 
  the North wall where a traveler would enter if he had come from Galilee, the 
  Golan Heights and Damascus. The Zion Gate is, logically, on Mt. Zion near the 
  traditional Tomb of David and site of the Upper Room of the Last Supper. The 
  Dung Gate faces South towards the Hinnom Valley where refuse from the city was 
  dumped in former times into the Hinnom Valley. The Sheep Gate--or, ST. STEPHEN'S 
  GATE </font>(go to <i>Der Judaenplatz</i> in Vienna)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">,

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The present walls around the Old 
  City were built from 1537 to 1541 by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent after the 
  Ottoman conquest of Israel. At that time most of the ancient walls were reduced 
  to rubble. Suleiman ordered that Jerusalem be fortified to protect its people 
  against marauding Bedouins. The walls were rebuilt upon the foundations of the 
  walls constructed during the time of the Second Temple and the later Roman expansion. 
  For the most part, the modern gates of the city are not closely related to the 
  walls and gates that existence in Roman times or earlier. There is some debate 
  about the correct location of some of the ancient gates and walls. However visitors 
  to the recently restored Jewish Quarter in the Old City can see an uncovered 
  section of the wall built by Nehemiah at the time of the return from the Babylonian 
  exile.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Old City retains its charm and 
  fascination to this days. Narrow crowded shops and the Oriental bazaar with 
  its many markets offer endless adventure for visitors and pilgrims. It is hard 
  to escape the feeling that one has stepped in the timeless, changeless past. 
  Each quarter of the Old City brings an immediate shift in architecture and shops, 
  in passers-by and inhabitants alike. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Temple Mount is conspicuous whether 
  viewed from the Mount of Olives, or from the Lutheran church tower across from 
  the Holy Sepulchre, or from the Citadel Museum roof. Normally tranquil and peaceful 
  with its park like setting, one would hardly guess that this small parcel of 
  land - less than 50 acres - is the center of the world and the hottest piece 
  of real estate anywhere on earth. BIBLICALLY SPEAKING, IT'S MOST EXCITING HISTORY 
  LIES YET AHEAD.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Golden Gate<BR>
  The Golden Gate is the most important and most impressive gate in Jerusalem, 
  and the only visible entrance to the city of Jerusalem from the East. This oldest 
  of all the gates to the city was the only one not rebuilt by Suleiman the Magnificent 
  in AD 1539-42. Monolithic stones in the wall just above ground have been identified 
  as 6th Century BC masonry from the time of Nehemiah, (Biblical Archaeological 
  Review [BAR], Mar/Apr 1992, p40). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  Golden Gate was walled up by the Arabs in the year 810. It has remained closed 
  now for nearly 12 centuries.</font></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Muslim name of the gate is Bab 
  al-Dhahabi. It is a now-closed double gate. The North portal is known as Bab 
  al-Tawba, the Gate of Repentance, and the Southern Portal, Bab al-Rahma, the 
  Gate of Mercy. The ancient Eastern gate to Jerusalem could be the one mentioned 
  as THE "BEAUTIFUL GATE" in Acts 3:2,10. The term Golden Gate may have been derived

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The Golden Gate has long interested 
  many Muslims, most Jews and Christians as the place of the Last Judgment. </font>(And 
  we would say that those judgments are already unfolding at this very time in 
  the Middle East)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Historically, judgments 
  were rendered in the gates of the city (Gen. 19:1, 23:10, for instance). Since 
  the Messiah was to come from the East (Matthew 24:27), it was concluded that 
  his judgment would be at the eastern gate. This is one reason for the many Muslim, 
  Christian, and Jewish graves on the Eastern slopes of the Temple Mount, in the 
  Kidron Valley, and on the Western slopes of the Mount of Olives</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some Muslims place Allah's final 
  judgment at this location also. Jews link the Messiah's arrival with this gate 
  and Christians have for centuries associated the Golden Gate with Palm Sunday 
  and also with the Second Advent (Luke 19:35-38). Jews expect the Messiah to 
  come through the Golden Gate, Muslims also expect Jesus to return to our world 
  at the end of the age to participate in the final judgment. Christians believe 
  it will be Jesus Christ who will conduct that final judgment. Zechariah 14:4-5 
  clearly states that the Messiah of Israel will return to Jerusalem from the 
  summit of the Mount of Olives AND THEN SURELY PROCEED INTO JERUSALEM FROM THE 
  EAST, in the direction of the Golden Gate.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Muslims compare the final judgment 
  of mankind to the crossing of a narrow knife blade which stretches from a mountain 
  (the Mount of Olives is often mentioned in Arab legend) to the "gate of heaven." 
  This knife-edged bridge evidently spans the Kidron Valley - as did an ancient 
  stone bridge in Roman times.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of the Messianic association 
  with the Golden Gate - which clearly symbolizes both judgment and mercy because 
  of the Arabic names attached to the gate - adherents to all three faiths have 
  wanted to be buried as close as possible to the Golden Gate. THE ASSUMPTION 
  WAS THAT THE DEAD IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY WOULD BE THE FIRST TO BE RAISED. 
  In the Middle Ages the Jews were forbidden to bury on Mount Moriah. Instead 
  they buried their dead opposite the gate and to the South on the Mount of Olives. 
  This Jewish cemetery is the oldest in continuous use anywhere in the world. 
  A burial plot, it is said, if it were available there, could cost $50,000 or 
  more. The Christian cemetery lies in the bottom of the Kidron Valley (in sad 
  condition) while the Muslim burial area covers the eastern Temple Mount hillside 
  up to and surrounding the Golden Gate. </font></P>
<P></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of the First Temple period 
  the eastern gate was closed (see Ezekiel XLIV, I. "Then he brought me back the 
  way of the outer gate of the sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it 
  was shut.")During the Second Temple period this was the site of the Shushan 
  Gate, mentioned in the Mishnah (Middot 1, 3), or the Eastern Gate (Nehemiah 
  III, 29). A causeway supported by arches ran from the gate across the Kidron 
  Valley, and was known as the Causeway of the Heifer, since the High Priest used 
  this way to reach the Mount of Olives where the ritual burning of the Red Heifer 
  took place, to purify the pilgrims with its ashes (Parah 111, 6; Shekalim IV, 
  2).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Mercy Gate, 257 m north of the 
  south-eastern corner of the Temple Mount, is the most beautiful of all the gates 
  of Jerusalem. It is approached from within the Temple Mount BY TWENTY TWO STAIRS, 
  WHICH LEAD INTO A MAGNIFICENT ENTRANCE, decorated with unusually intricate carvings 
  of acanthus leaves, which appear to be moving. The gateroom is a hall with six 
  domes supported by huge marble pillars. On the east side of the hall are two 
  gateways, now blocked up, beautifully decorated on the outside.</font></P>
<P align="center">(Blame it all on Helena, the mother of Constantine, who was 
  among the first to come to this city with a retinueof priests, saying &quot;This 
  must by this place, and that must be that place.&quot; The world has been making 
  pilgrimages to those sites ever since).<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The New Testament (Acts IlI 2) calls 
  this the Beautiful Gate; it may therefore BE ASSUMED to have existed during 
  the period of Aelia Capitolina. However, its present beauty was not attained 
  until the reign of Justinian, in honour of the Christian tradition which fixes 
  this as the site of Jesus' entry to the Temple courtyard. The gate was probably 
  open during the Byzantine period, and the Emperor Heraclius entered through 
  it after taking Jerusalem in 629. After the Muslim Conquest, when the Dome of 
  the Rock and the EI-Aksa Mosque were built, it was blocked to prevent unsupervised 
  access to the mosque area.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AI-Muqaddasi (985) mentions two arches 
  to this gate, the southern one called Bab e-Rahma (Gate of Mercy) and the northern 
  one Bab e-Tauba (Gate of Repentance); both were closed. The double gate is also 
  mentioned by Nasir i-Khosrau (1047) and Mujir e-Din (1496). Shams e-Din e-Suyuti, 
  who visited Jerusalem in 1470, ascribes a reference in the Koran (LVII, v3) 
  to this gate: "Then there will separate them a wall wherein is a gate, the inner 
  side whereof containeth mercy, while the outer side thereof is toward the doom." 
  According to this verse the inner gate, containing mercy, is Bab e-Rahma, while 
  the outer one is Bab e-Tauba, indicating the punishment in Gehenna. The Kidron 
  Valley is known in Arabic, among other names, as Wadi Jehennum (Valley of Gehenna) 
  implying punishment and torture. The gate is also known in Arabic as Bab el-Dahariyeh 
  (Gate of Eternity), recalling the visions of Joel (IV, 2 and 12), or the Twin 
  Gate, because of its shape, which can be seen quite clearly from the Mount of 
  Olives. In the time of the Crusaders it was opened twice a year on Christian 
  festivals: once in the spring, on Palm Sunday, recalling Jesus' triumphal entry 
  to the city through this gate (St. Matthew XXI, 1-8); and once in the autumn, 
  to commemorate the entry of the Emperor Heraclius. The gate was finally closed 
  under Turkish rule....</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pillars of the Golden Gate are 
  said to be a gift of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon according to one ancient 
  legend, but these would not be part of the present gate above the surface of 
  the ground which is too recent. Some scholars have noted that the double gates 
  of repentance and mercy contrast not only Law and Grace but are reminders of 
  the two bronze pillars, Jachin, "in his counsel" and Boaz, "by his strength" 
  which stood in the front of the First Temple. James 2:13 notes that God is just, 
  but that his mercy "triumphs" over judgment. According to James, although God 
  is just and must judge the world with equity and impartiality, the mercy of 
  God is a greater and higher attribute of the God of the Bible. He is ready to 
  forgive all who seek him, and his mercy abounds. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Penitents to the Temple entering 
  the courts through the Northern Gate of Repentance in Temple Times could seek 
  the forgiveness of the living God by sacrifice and petition in the Temple, and 
  leave by the Southern Gate having obtained mercy and grace. The Golden Gate 
  is thus a wonderful reminder of the unchanging character of God. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The interior corridors of the Golden 
  Gate are exceptionally beautiful and well-built according to published reports. 
  Sadly, visitors to the Temple Mount today are not allowed to inspect the interior 
  of the Golden Gate. Nor can tourists walk through the Muslim cemetery along 
  the Eastern Wall to inspect the exterior of the gate. One can only hope that 
  this gate can be reopened in the near future and fully restored for access to 
  the Temple site by all nations.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus says the LORD: "Keep justice, 
  and do righteousness, for soon my salvation will come, and my deliverance be 
  revealed. Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it 
  fast, who keeps the sabbath, not profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing 
  any evil." Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, "The 
  LORD will surely separate me from his people"; and let not the eunuch say, "Behold, 
  I am a dry tree." For thus says the LORD: "To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths, 
  who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant, I will give 
  in my house and within my walls a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; 
  I will give them an everlasting name which shall not be cut off. "And the foreigners 
  who join themselves to the LORD, to minister to him, to love the name of the 
  LORD, and to be his servants, every one who keeps the sabbath, and does not 
  profane it, and holds fast my covenant - these I will bring to my holy mountain, 
  and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their 
  sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house 
  of prayer for all peoples. (Isaiah 56:1-7)...</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Josephus states (Wars V, 184-189) 
  that the Eastern temple enclosure wall was the only one not rebuilt by Herod 
  the Great. The ancient gate beneath the Golden Gate may therefore date from 
  Solomonic times or at least from the time of Nehemiah. Such a view of consistent 
  with Asher Kaufman's view that the First and Second Temples were located 110 
  meters North of the Dome of the Rock in the immediate vicinity of the small 
  Dome of the Tablets shrine on the main temple platform.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Moreover, it now seems clear that 
  before the Golden Gate was constructed, the entrance to the Temple Mount from 
  outside the city was in exactly the same location. Recently, part of an arch 
  was discovered directly beneath the Golden Gate. This partial arch definitely 
  belongs to an older gate, a gate that many date even to Solomonic times." (Asher 
  Kaufman, BAR, March/April 1983, p. 45).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mid-point of the Golden Gate 
  is 348 feet North of the East-West centerline of the Dome of the Rock allowing 
  a straight-line access into the temple courts from the East assuming Kaufman's 
  theory is correct. Kaufman's model for the location of the First and Second 
  Temples lines up the Temples, the Golden Gate and the Red Heifer Altar on the 
  Mount of Olives. Kaufman's location for the site of the Red Heifer offering 
  is a small walled garden owned by the Armenian Church. It is located just across 
  the summit road from the Muslim Mosque of the Ascension which is a traditional 
  location for the place of the Ascension of Jesus Christ into heaven. Kaufman 
  believes the Red Heifer altar site would have been sanctified ground made holy 
  by a system of underground arches beneath the garden designed to prevent any 
  defilement from dead bodies from seeping upwards to the sanctified ground. There 
  are locked cisterns in the garden which could be explored to test Kaufman's 
  hypothesis. Our scientific team sought to obtain the necessary permission to 
  explore the garden cisterns from the Armenian Patriarch in our science and archaeology 
  work in Israel in 1983, however it was not granted to us at that time. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ezekiel 43:1-9 supports the Jewish 
  tradition that the entire Temple Mount as well as the Temple itself is set aside 
  in a special way for the service of the Holy One of Israel. God has evidently 
  been, over many centuries, offended by the many defilements of this area. Cemeteries, 
  tombs and burial places as well as idolatrous shrines are clearly inappropriate 
  in the vicinity of the Temple Mount. Apparently these graves must all be removed 
  before a temple acceptable to Yahweh can be built there:</font></P>

    the earth shone with his glory. And the vision I saw was like the vision which 
    I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and like the vision which I had

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Haram esh-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, 
  as the Muslims call the Temple Mount, is a garden plaza containing many varied 
  structures such as paved platforms, domes (qubbeh), prayer niches (mihribs), 
  fountains and arcades (mawwazin). In the course of time the Temple Mount has 
  acquired a large number of fountains (sabil) and small shrines, minarets from 
  the Mamaluk period (manara or maazneh), prayer platforms (mutasalla) Many of 
  these Islamic features were installed as gifts from important visitors caliphs 
  and potentates. Religious schools (madraseh) and various offices may be found 
  around the perimeter. In the compound today there are about one hundred structures, 
  both large and small. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Entering the Mount from the Mograbi 
  Gate the visitor will find an Islamic Museum immediately to the right. The Islamic 
  Museum contains a good collection of Byzantine and Islamic antiquities. Slightly 
  east of the Museum is the cavernous El-Aksa Mosque, a huge rectangular, largely 
  unadorned, structure featuring a small gray dome. This present building dates 
  from the 10th Century when it accepted that Jerusalem was masjid el-aksa, "the 
  furthermost sanctuary." The glacial marble columns, a gift from Mussolini, date 
  from the most recent major restoration of 1938-1942. The first mosque on the 
  site, that of the Caliph Abd el Malek ibn Mirwan, (or his son El-Walid), was 
  built between 709 and 715 AD, but was twice destroyed by earthquakes in the 
  first 60 years of its existence. After the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, the 
  mosque became the first royal residence and then the headquarters of the Knights 
  Templars. Saladin tore down many of the Crusader additions and later Mamluk 
  sultans made additions and changes. An ascending passage from the walled-up 
  double gates in the Southern Wall of the temple compound rises to the surface 
  of the present platform just North of the mosque.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the Dome of the Rock rests 
  on the bedrock of Mt. Moriah, El-Aksa mosque is supported on pillars, fill, 
  and vaults from below. This makes the building more susceptible to earthquakes 
  of course. Severe earthquake damage occurred in 774, 777, and 1033 according 
  to historic records. The building was built on the foundations of a Byzantine 
  church built during the reign of Justinian and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. 
  Byzantine historian Procopius wrote that the church was built in 560 AD and 
  burned down by the Persians in 614. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pinnacle of the Temple where 
  Jesus was tempted by the devil (Matthew 4:1-11) has been traditionally associated 
  with the south-eastern corner of the Temple Mount because of the great height 
  above the Kidron Valley below. The recent discovery on an inscribed stone at 
  the south-west corner indicated that corner was "the place of trumpeting" (blowing 
  of the Shofar) has raised the possibility that the second temptation of Jesus 
  took place there. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eusebius (Ecclesiastical History, 
  2:23) tells us that James the Just, brother of Jesus and pastor of the early 
  Christian church in Jerusalem was martyred by being thrown down from the pinnacle 
  of the temple mount. He survived the fall and was then stoned, praying for forgiveness 
  for his persecutors as he died. Stephen, the first martyr of the Christian church 
  (Acts 6:8-7:60) was also martyred near the temple mount ("outside the city"). 
  The gate that bears his name commemorates the traditional area where he finally 
  died... </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE DOME OF ASCENSION (Qubbet el-Mi'Araj), 
  built around 1200, commemorates MOHAMMED'S LEAP INTO THE HEAVENS, or at least 
  the place he has supposed to have prayed before his ascension. It is a copy 
  of a Byzantine Dome on the Mount of Olives that marks the spot of Jesus' Ascension 
  according to Islamic tradition. The existence of this structure, built from 
  Crusader materials, suggests that the Dome of the Rock may not have been the 
  exact spot of Mohammed's alleged ascent into paradise. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A small dome, the Dome of the Prophet 
  (E-Nabi), stands east of the Dome of the Rock and was built by the Turkish governor

  niche facing Mecca. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Dome of the Prophet Elijah (Qubbet 
  el-Khadr) is an open dome at the northwest corner of the platform supported 
  by six marble columns with an interior place for prayer. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Dome of the Rock is not a true 
  mosque but a shrine. Begun about 688 and finished about 691 (other writers say 
  692 to 697) - it is the first and oldest Islamic shrine in the world. THIS OCTOGONAL 
  STRUCTURE is one of the most beautiful edifices in the Middle East. The interior 
  contain two concentric rows of pillars - the inner circle supports the dome, 
  and the outer circle the best of the building. The inner circle of pillars, 
  about 60 feet in diameter - encloses exposed bed rock which rises several feet 
  above the floor. THIS IS TRADITIONALLY THE FAMOUS FOUNDATIONS STONE. The dome-supporting 
  pillars are sixteen in number, twelve of marble and four of granite. Sixteen 
  windows in the cupola are made of colored glass against a background of gold. 
  Some of these windows go back to the 15th Century, but most date from the 18th 
  and 19th. The octagonal walls of the building itself contain 56 windows, 7 in 
  each wall. The outer circle of pillars supporting the building consists of eight 
  of marble and sixteen of colored granite - 24 in all. These pillars are topped 
  by capitals which may have come from Herod's temple, or possibly from the Church 
  of the Holy Sepulchre destroyed by the Persians in 614 AD At the beginning of 
  the tenth century the cupola was sheathed in brass and then covered with gold. 
  This was later changed to lead. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The underground areas of the Temple 
  Mount are the most interesting features in the whole area from the standpoint 
  of history and archaeology. Largely inaccessible for centuries, many of the 
  cisterns and a few of the tunnels and rooms were explored more than a hundred 
  years ago by the Palestine Exploration Society. Nevertheless a fair understanding 
  of what lies beneath the surface has been pieced together by diligent and careful 
  researchers, some motivated by archaeology, and others by a desire to locate 
  the foundation of the First and Second Temples and associated storage rooms.</font></P>

<P align="center">TIPS ON TOURING VIENNA FROM ON HIGH AND BELOW</P>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"> Vienna, Austria's elegant and mysterious capital, rests on 
    an underground network of cellars, vaults, stables and tunnels dating from 
    medieval and even Roman times that hold keys to much of its history. Built 
    and used by everyone from nuns and tradesmen to thieves and murderers, the 
    underground network provides an enticing look at the dark side of this ancient 
    and somewhat macabre city, which stands at what used to be the old boundary 
    between the Soviet bloc and the free world, and was long a haven for spies. 
  </p>
  <p>The most famous subterranean structure is the city's massive sewer system. 
    Its huge vaulted floodways and narrow staircases built beneath innocent-looking 
    poster-plastered kiosks allowed Harry Lime, the character played by Orson 
    Wells in the 1949 noir film &quot;The Third Man,&quot; to move clandestinely 
    through the city during its post-World War II occupation. You can explore 
    these unusual and slightly sinister constructions on informal walking tours, 
    which are growing in popularity in many European cities and are, for my money, 
    among the best ways to absorb a sense of place. </p>
  <p>One of Vienna's most intriguing underground tours is given by Brigitte Timmermann, 
    who has written a soon-to-be-published book on &quot;The Third Man,&quot; 
    placing the film in its historical context. Though it takes you through the 
    sewers where the film was shot, rest assured, it isn't a stinker. These are 
    mostly storm drains, and access depends on low rainfall. As with all the cellar 
    tours, it is advisable to bring a flashlight and sensible shoes... </p>
  <p>In 1995, workers renovating a house on Laurenzerbergasse began to clear out 
    old rubble beneath a room that had been quickly refinished after the war. 
    Over a period of days, a huge room emerged that went three stories below street 
    level. More excavation revealed more bricked rooms and underground tunnels 
    to other houses. The rooms turned out to be part of a convent founded in the 
    14th century and dissolved in 1782 by the emperor Joseph II, who was closing 
    religious institutions across the empire. </p>
  <p>Among the most historical of the recently uncovered sites is a synagogue 
    built in what is now Judenplatz, or Jewish Square, in the mid-13th century. 
    It was, in its time, one of the most important Talmud schools in the German-speaking 
    world and made this part of Vienna the center of Jewish life until 1421, when 
    the temple was destroyed during a pogrom. The ruins, excavated beginning in 
    1995, stretch under the square and are visible today with entry through the 
    Jewish Museum, Judenplatz 8. </p>
  <p>A memorial to Austria's 65,000 Holocaust victims, completed by British artist 
    Rachel Whiteread in 2000, stands starkly in the quiet square, and makes an 
    especially moving tribute to the lives and contributions of Vienna's Jews, 
    who made up a tenth of the city's population before the wars. It is estimated 
    that as many as 7,000 Jews survived the Holocaust by hiding in Vienna's cellars. 
  </p>
  <p>Another eerie reminder of Vienna's past lies, literally, in the crypt of 
    St. Michael's Church, in Michaelerplatz, near the entrance to the Imperial 
    Palace. This somber cathedral became the preferred burial site for families 
    who, for social reasons, sought eternal rest in the parish church of the imperial 
    court. </p>
  <p>Dozens of brittle wooden caskets and many uncannily well-preserved bodies 
    can be seen as you walk around the dimly lighted crypt beneath the arched 
    brick ceiling. The bodies, still clothed and packed in wood shavings, are 
    a startling sight; the effect is enhanced by stacks of bones and skulls from 
    caskets that fell apart over the centuries. Photographs are forbidden, and 
    none of the dead are identified, although Mozart librettist Pietro Metastasio 
    is said to be among them. </p>

    and religious. Since the war of June 1967, the party has taken a hard nationalist 
    line. Supporting Eretz Israel (that is, Jewish settlement and the annexation 
    of the occupied territories), it acted as a cradle for Gush Emunim. This movement 
    of extremist settlers sees itself as the heir to Rabbi Yehuda Kok who was 
    the first TO COMBINE MESSIANIC JUDAISM WITH NATIONALISM. His young supporters 
    go to special religious schools (yeshivot hesder) where they learn the holy 
    scriptures together with arms drill (unlike the normal yeshivot whose graduates

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Yahadut Hatora bloc consists 
    of two movements of Ashkenazi origin, Agudat Israel and Degel Hatora. The 
    former is an ultra-Orthodox, non-Zionist party, which in the past held moderate 
    political positions, and then from the 1980s opportunistically followed the 
    hard line of the pro-annexation right. Its leadership could return towards 
    the Labour Party if it were to gain power and material advantage from such 
    a shift. Degel Hatora came into being in the 1980s as the result of a split 
    within Agudat Israel to do with dynastic rabbinical rivalries. In these two 
    parties, their rabbinical mentors take the decisions. In the 1996 elections, 
    the Yahadut Hatora bloc won almost 99,000 votes and four MKs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shas brings together Oriental (mainly 
    Moroccan) ultra-Orthodox Jews, who felt discriminated against in Agudat Israel. 
    They split from it in 1984 and managed in a few years to overtake it in terms 
    of supporters and voters. Shas' main political leader is Arieh Deri, a born 
    manipulator, and its spiritual guide id Rabbi Ovadia Yossef, a former Sepharadi 
    Chief Rabbi. Shas' leaders, like those of Agudat Israel, know how to play 
    on the rivalry between the two main parties to draw maximum profit. At one 
    moment, they supported Yitzhak Rabin and the Oslo accords. Still verbally 
    supporting the peace negotiations, they help Binyamin Netanyahu stay in power. 
    Shas recruits essentially among poor Orientals, exploiting social discontent 
    and &quot;ethnic&quot; resentment of the Ashkenazis. But it also engages in 
    superstition, giving out amulets and saying that their spiritual leader, Eliyahu 
    Kaduri, has supernatural qualities. The party has reservations about settlements 
    in the occupied territories, except in East Jerusalem. In the last elections, 
    Shas won nearly 260,000 votes and got 10 MKs.</font></p>

    - that is, expulsion - of the Palestinians. The same goes for the supporters 
    of Kach, supposedly banned, which, like the Neemanei Har Habayit (Faithful 
    of the Temple), use religion to justify their ideology and fascist-leaning 
    practices. They create provocations, especially in Jerusalem, with the declared 
    object of pulling down the mosques and rebuilding the Temple.</font></p>

  Christian Messianic Groups and the Rebuilding of the Temple</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> by Yaakov Ariel</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The rebuilding of the Temple has 
    played an important part in Christian pre-millenialist Messianic expectations. 
    Such an event would for them signify the imminent arrival of the messianic 
    age. Following the Six-Day War in 1967 and the Israeli conquest of the historical 
    parts of Jerusalem, many pre-millenialist Christians have expected the Jews 
    to build the Temple and reinstate the sacrifices prescribed in the Bible. 
    The rise in the 1970s of Jewish groups that have advocated, and at times made 
    preparations for, the rebuilding of the Temple has encouraged Christian pre-millenialists. 
    Evangelical leaders and organizations, which represent millions of conservative 
    Christians, have lent their support to the state of Israel as the nation that 
    prepares the ground for the arrival of the Messiah. Some Christian pre-millenialists 
    have taken steps to help hasten the rebuilding of the Temple and consequently 
    the coming of the Messiah. They have helped finance Jewish groups that have 
    called for the rebuilding of the Temple. They have also searched for the Lost 
    Ark, helped breed red heifers whose ashes are needed in order to enable Jews 
    to enter the Temple Mount, and researched the exact location of the Temple. 
    In rare isolated cases, extremists have tried to burn or blow up the mosques 
    on the Temple Mount in order to secure the ground for the building of the 
    temple. Towards the year 2000, Israeli and American officials became particularly 
    concerned that Christian believers in the imminent arrival of Jesus would 
    try to hasten the messianic clock by helping Jewish extremists blow up the 
    Temple Mount mosques. The prospect of a successful Jewish-Christian collaboration 
    in such a scheme could let all hell loose and bring about a Middle Eastern 
    apocalypse.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

<p align="center"><b>Tisha B'Av, it is not in the East.</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today is Tisha B'Av, the ninth 
    day of the Hebrew month of Av, the saddest day on the Jewish calendar. It 
    marks the destruction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem, the ancient 
    demise of Jewish sovereignty and the dispersion of the people of Israel to 
    the four corners of the earth. Throughout Jewish history the date has come 
    to be associated with a range of national disasters, from medieval expulsions 
    and persecutions to the outbreak of World War I. Accordingly, it is a day 
    steeped in sorrow, one tradition says is to be spent in fasting and remembrance. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Israelis, the need for a national 
    day of mourning has perhaps never been so self-evident. After a lull of nearly 
    three weeks, Tuesday's horrific terror attack in Emmanuel was a lethal and 
    painful reminder that Palestinian terror is still very much a threat, lying 
    in wait for any opportunity to kill and maim as many innocent Israelis as 
    possible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The central focus of the Tisha 
    B'Av rituals, of course, concerns the Temple Mount, where King Solomon's temple 
    once stood. Observant Jews pray for its rebuilding daily, and for many Israelis 
    the Mount itself symbolizes the historic return of the Jewish people to their 
    homeland. Indeed, the crowning moment of the Six Day War came when the crackling 
    radio blared the words &quot;Har HaBayit beyadenu!&quot; (The Temple Mount 
    is in our hands!) across the airwaves, signifying the liberation of Judaism's 
    holiest site. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The enthusiasm of the moment, however, 
    was quickly diluted when defense minister Moshe Dayan handed over the keys 
    of the Mount to the Muslim Wakf. Worse still, in the intervening years successive 
    Israeli governments have demonstrated shameful apathy-- often outright indifference-- 
    to the Wakf's actions, doing little to prevent the wanton destruction of priceless 
    historical and archaeological artifacts. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As prominent archeologist Dr. Eilat 
    Mazar, a leader of the Committee Against the Destruction of Temple Mount Artifacts, 
    noted the other day, the situation on the Mount is highly precarious. In an 
    interview with Arutz Sheva, Mazar said, &quot;The large scale destruction 
    of artifacts has stopped and the trucks have stopped carting away tons of 
    valuable debris, but the situation is still bad: There is no supervision whatsoever 
    on the Temple Mount. We have no way of knowing what is going on underground 
    in the large caverns, where the Wakf has been making preparations to build 
    and make major changes.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even more worrisome, Mazar noted, 
    are the effects of the Wakf's unsupervised work on the structural stability 
    of the site: &quot;The Southern Wall is beginning to buckle because of the 
    changes they are making...and nothing is being done about it. The Sharon government 
    has decided to ignore the matter, despite the critical importance of what 
    is going on there.&quot; Last year alone the Wakf was able to remove some 
    20,000 tons of debris uncovered during its unlawful excavations, which reportedly 
    included artifacts dating back to the First Temple period. To date, charges 
    have yet to be brought against anyone in the Wakf for these brazen acts of 
    defiance. As Mazar put it: &quot;Their stated goal is to turn the entire Temple 
    Mount compound-- all 144 dunams of it-- into an active mosque. They are doing 
    so, and no one is stopping it.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sadly, the government continues 
    to play into the Wakf's hands by acceding to its refusal to allow non-Muslims 
    to visit the Temple Mount or pray there. Though Israel justifiably prides 
    itself on its policy of freedom of access to the holy sites for members of 
    all faiths, that policy-- inexplicably-- does not seem to apply to Jews on 
    the Temple Mount. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leaving aside the halachic issues 
    involved, it is simply unfathomable that Israel's government should close 
    off the Jewish people's holiest site and bar entry to Jews, all because of 
    the Wakf's intolerance and bigotry. It is an affront to the rule of law and, 
    as Tisha B'Av reminds us, to Jewish history as well. It is time for the sound 
    of Jewish prayer to return to the Temple Mount. Three decades of inaction 
    have allowed the Wakf to thumb its nose at Israeli rule, calling into question 
    just who is in charge on the Mount. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Interior Security Minister Uzi 
    Landau courageously chose to shut down the offices of Al-Quds University in 
    Jerusalem last week because they were defying Israeli law and sovereignty. 
    One can only hope the government will awaken to the plight of the Temple Mount 
    as well, and act to restore Israel's control over it-- in the fullest sense 
    of the word. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><br>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JERUSALEM (January 28) - Palestinian 
    Authority Mufti Ikrima Sabri on Friday denied a report in that day's The Jerusalem 
    Post that the Supreme Moslem Council had stated in a 1930 pamphlet that the 
    Jews had an undisputable historic connection with the Temple Mount. According 
    to Itim, Sabri said the report was untrue and taken out of context. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Post article quoted an English-language 
    guide for tourists, published in 1930 by the Supreme Moslem Council, which 
    states: &quot;The site['s]... identity with the site of Solomon's Temple is 
    beyond dispute,&quot; while a footnote refers the reader to Samuel II:26:25. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sabri told Itim that the council's 
    booklet had been published only one year after the Arab disturbances of 1929, 
    which, he said, the Arabs called the &quot;Burak Rebellion&quot; (Western 
    Wall Rebellion). Sabri claimed that, at the time, the League of Nations had 
    decided that the Western Wall was Moslem, adding that Jews were permitted 
    to pray there on condition they made no changes to the site; particularly 
    not setting up tables or benches. Blowing the shofar was expressly forbidden. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sabri also told Itim that the British-appointed 
    Shaw Commission had come to the same conclusion and had decided that the Western 
    Wall was part of Haram al-Sharif [the Temple Mount], and undeniably Moslem 
    property. Sabri told Itim that neither the League of Nations nor the Shaw 
    Commission had mentioned the word Kotel in reference to the Western Wall, 
    only the Arabic al-Burak. The site, he reportedly said, was one of the holiest 
    in Islam, since it was from there that the Prophet Mohammed rose up to heaven. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sabri added that all these developments 
    had come about when the Supreme Moslem Council was headed by Hajj Amin al-Husseini 
    and that it was inconceivable that Husseini had given Jews any rights at all 
    to the Temple Mount. Itim noted that the Arab Revolt had broken out on August 
    16, 1929, following an impromptu Arab demonstration organized in response 
    to a Jewish march to the Western Wall on the previous day, Tisha Be'av. The 
    demonstrators were also protesting the expansion of the Jewish Agency. During 
    the protest, Jewish religious objects were destroyed near the Wall. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few days later, gangs of armed 
    Arabs attacked Jews in Jerusalem, Hebron, Safed, and farming settlements, 
    killing 133 Jews and wounding 339. The Shaw Commission, headed by Sir Walter 
    Shaw, was appointed by the British Colonial Office to investigate the riots, 
    and it concluded that the riots had resulted from Arab fears for their political 
    and economic rights in the face of the development of Palestine as a Jewish 
    national home. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The commission gave the Arab leaders 
    a slap on the wrist, and skipped over the British authorities' responsibility 
    for the events. The League of Nations' Mandate Commission later sharply criticized 
    the Shaw Commission.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE HOLY WAR THAT 
    ISRAEL WANTS<br>
    By Jonathan Cook <br>
    The Electronic Intifada<br>
    7-12-3</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The inhabitants of Nazareth, Israel's 
    only Arab city, often talk of the &quot;invisible occupation&quot;: although 
    they rarely see police -- let alone soldiers -- on their streets, they are 
    held in a vise-like grip of Israeli control just as much as their ethnic kin 
    in neighbouring Palestinian cities like Jenin and Nablus are. In September 
    2000, for example, when Israel's one million Palestinian citizens, including 
    Nazarenes, demonstrated against Ariel Sharon's visit to the mosque compound 
    in Jersualem -- known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple 
    Mount -- 13 of their number were shot dead by police in four days. Not a single 
    protester had been armed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Last week the veil was again briefly 
    lifted from the occupation inside Israel. More than 500 heavily armed police 
    officers stormed Nazareth's city centre at dawn, arresting a handful of Muslim 
    clerics and demolishing the foundations of a mosque that has been making headlines 
    since a &quot;holy tent&quot; was first erected in 1998 at the site of the 
    grave of Shihab ad-Deen, the nephew of Salah ad-Deen. In all the excitement 
    over Israel's withdrawals from Gaza and Bethlehem, the invasion of Nazareth 
    was overlooked, except in the Hebrew press, where it was presented as a brave 
    attempt by the government to rein in lawlessness and calm religious tensions 
    in a city that is now 70 per cent Muslim and 30 per cent Christian. <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the case of Nazareth's &quot;rogue&quot; 
    mosque is far more complicated than this -- and potentially more revealing 
    of the political games Israel is playing with the delicate balance of forces 
    between the country's religious communities. <br>
    In fact, far from being patently illegal, the mosque had actually won approval 
    from two governments, Binyamin Netanyahu's in 1998 and Ehud Barak's in 1999. 
    Both backed the plan, even though the mosque was to be located a few provocative 
    yards from one of the holiest churches in the Middle East, the Basilica of 
    the Annunciation. (Built on the site, say Catholics, where the Virgin Mary 
    was told she was carrying the son of God.) Violent clashes briefly erupted 
    between Christians and Muslims in the wake of these decisions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The government's position, however, 
    changed last year, apparently after the Pope and President George W. Bush 
    got wind that local Muslims had started laying the mosque's foundations. Bush 
    put heavy pressure on Sharon to intervene, and dutifully the Israeli prime 
    minister set up a committee to consider the question again. It used a loophole 
    -- that the building work had begun before all the official papers had been 
    received -- to justify finding against the mosque's completion in March 2002. 
    There has been plenty of unhelpful hyperbole from Muslim clerics about the 
    mosque destruction being a &quot;war on Islam,&quot; but one point they make 
    is worth examining. Why, in the same week as the demolition, they ask, did 
    Israel reveal it was allowing Jews to return to Jerusalem's Haram/Temple Mount 
    complex? Non-Muslims have been banned from the area since Sharon's visit 33 
    months ago unleashed the intifada (as de facto have most Palestinians, who 
    can longer get permits to enter Jerusalem). For a government so zealously 
    concerned about sectarian provocations, this was a strange decision.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, Jews demanding to go to 
    the mount are mainly Messianic extremists who want to destroy the al-Aqsa 
    and Dome of the Rock mosques and replace them with a reconstruction of the 
    Second Temple. Mainstream Jews have been prohibited from the site since rabbis 
    banned prayer there in the Middle Ages. But that has not stopped the government 
    from promoting Jewish claims to the mount. In May the public security minister 
    Tzachi Hanegbi became the latest cabinet minister to say it was time to let 
    Jews pray there. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Israeli government's behaviour 
    in Nazareth is equally baffling. Despite newspaper claims, the city's Christians 
    and Muslims forgot their differences a while ago, with the outbreak of the 
    intifada and the more pressing concern of how to survive the economic slump. 
    The decision to demolish the mosque in such a heavy-handed manner is far more 
    likely to tear the delicate fabric of civic life here. Already there are calls 
    for the resignation of Nazareth's Christian mayor, Ramez Jeraisi. So why do 
    it now? Nazareth's Christians and Muslims unite in offering a disturbing explanation. 
    They say Israel has a vested interest in fomenting trouble in their city to 
    show that the two religions cannot live together in peace. &quot;If they cannot 
    share their holy sites in Nazareth, how can they ever do so in Jerusalem?&quot; 
    is how Nazarenes describe the logic of Israeli spin. <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of the long path of 
    the US-backed road map to a Palestinian state is an international conference 
    to decide the most charged question of all: who should have sovereignty over 
    Jerusalem and its holy places, the Israelis or the Palestinians? Both peoples 
    hope to be rewarded with control of the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount site. 
    In the meantime the struggle for the ultimate prize, including Israeli attempts 
    to weight the decision in its favour, risks doing irreparable damage to religious 
    tolerance in the Holy Land. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">September/October 2002__Nearly 
    three decades after leaving his job as a marketing manager at Colgate-Palmolive, 
    Ed McAteer, considered one of the godfathers of the modern Religious Right, 
    still sounds like a salesman. In a well-honed patter, he tells of introducing 
    Jerry Falwell to then-presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, discussing spiritual 
    matters with Jesse Helms and John Ashcroft, and helping organize the evangelical 
    movement that has become the most powerful grassroots component of the Republican 
    Party. But no subject excites the 76-year-old born-again Baptist more than 
    his unequivocal love for the Jewish people and the state of Israel, and his 
    increasingly influential role as one of the nation's leading &quot;Christian 
    Zionists.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The passion of McAteer, a gregarious 
    man with a toothy smile and thinning wisps of brushed-back hair, is evident 
    during a prayer breakfast in May for more than 200 people at the Israeli Embassy 
    in Washington, D.C. &quot;I am delighted and thrilled and just pumped up to 
    be here,&quot; McAteer tells the crowd in a Tennessee drawl, nearly bouncing 
    behind a podium backed by brightly colored banners celebrating the biblical 
    tribes of Israel. Before him sits the self-described inner circle of Christian 
    Zionism: pastors, preachers, and religious activists who quietly but effectively 
    lobby for Israel. With a born-again Christian in the White House and events 
    in the Middle East spinning out of control, McAteer recognizes the power of 
    those in the room to influence U.S. policy on behalf of Israel. &quot;The 
    best friends that Israel has are those people who believe the Bible does not 
    contain the word of God, but that the Bible is the word of God,&quot; he announces 
    to the faithful. <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When McAteer left the business 
    world in 1976 to help organize the Christian right, the idea of the Israeli 
    government working hand in hand with conservative Christians would have been 
    difficult to imagine. At that time, some evangelical groups were openly anti-Semitic 
    and associated with the John Birch Society and other far-right groups. Today, 
    though, Christian conservatives provide Israel -- and in particular the hard-line 
    Likud Party of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon -- with its most important political 
    support in the United States. They oppose Israel ceding land to the Palestinians 
    and are pressuring the Bush administration to close Palestinian offices in 
    the United States. They also have close ties to GOP congressional leaders 
    and to a group of high-ranking hawks in the Pentagon -- led by Deputy Defense 
    Secretary Paul Wolfowitz -- that some D.C. insiders call the &quot;Kosher 
    Nostra.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They are very vocal and have 
    shifted the center of gravity toward Israel and against concessions,&quot; 
    says Doug Bandow, an evangelical who serves as a senior fellow at the conservative 
    Cato Institute. &quot;It colors the environment in which decisions are being 
    made.&quot; Indeed, thanks to the top-level connections and grassroots activism 
    of evangelical Christians, U.S. policy in the Middle East has never been so 
    closely aligned with Israel as it is under the administration of George W. 
    Bush. As the conflict in the Mideast has heated up, even some of the Jewish 
    state's most ardent supporters have been surprised by the president's strong 
    pro-Israel stance.</font></p>

  A Message for Shavuot from the Temple Institute</font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Biblical festival of Shavuot, 
    the Feast of Weeks, begins Thursday evening. This holiday marks the anniversary 
    of G-d's revelation at Mount Sinai. At this event, which changed the course 
    of human history, the Creator bequeathed the Torah and its commandments to 
    Israel. Israel entered into a covenant with G-d and received her unique, Divine 
    mission: to sanctify the name of G-d before the eyes of the entire world. 
    This goal is exemplified by the commandment of &quot;And you shall make for 
    Me a sanctuary, that I shall dwell among you&quot; (Ex. 25:8), which was actualized 
    in the Tabernacle and later in the First and Second Temples. For when the 
    people of Israel dwell in the Land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel, 
    with the Shechina (the Divine Presence) in their midst, it is the greatest 
    possible sanctification of G-d. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exactly seven weeks prior to Shavuot, 
    on the festival of Passover, Israel became a nation. The reality of the exodus, 
    on the backdrop of the miracles that attest to G-d's preeminent love for Israel, 
    saw Israel gain her physical freedom and national identity...as the Bible 
    states, &quot;Has G-d ever tried to come to take a nation from out of the 
    midst of another nation, with signs and wonders, and in war, and with a strong 
    hand and an outstretched arm, and with great wonders, like all that the L-rd 
    your G-d has done for you?&quot; (Deut. 4:34) </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The period between Passover and 
    Shavuot is known as the &quot;days of counting the Omer&quot; (the omer is 
    a measure of barley that was brought in the Temple on the second day of Passover). 
    This is a period of spiritual cleansing, in anticipation of receiving the 
    Torah at Shavuot -- as the Bible states, &quot;And you shall count for yourselves, 
    from the day following the great Sabbath, from the day you bring the omer 
    wave-offering; seven complete weeks they shall be&quot; (Lev. 23:15). Traditionally, 
    intense spiritual longing and introspection mark this period. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Passover marks the physical 
    birth of the Jewish people as a nation, so Shavuot represents Israel's spiritual 
    inception. For the covenant that was forged between the Holy One and Israel, 
    is manifest in the Bible&#133;the constitution of the Jewish people. When 
    Israel reaffirms that covenant and accepts that her destiny is unlike that 
    of other nations, then the whole world is elevated through her actions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the focal points of that 
    destiny rests upon the sanctity of the Land of Israel. In fact, in many ways, 
    Shavuot is the special holiday of the Land of Israel. In the time of the Holy 
    Temple, the festival of Shavuot was marked by special Temple observances. 
    Three particular commandments are fulfilled on Shavuot in the Holy Temple, 
    which emphasize the holiness of the Land: the bringing of the omer, the special 
    offering of the twin loaves, AND MOST OF ALL THE BRINGING OF THE FIRSTFRUITS.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, while the Temple has not 
    yet been rebuilt, what are our first fruits? What is the status of the Land 
    of Israel, about which the Bible testifies: &quot;It is a land that the L-rd 
    your G-d seeks out constantly; the eyes of the L-rd your G-d are on it, from 
    the beginning of the year to the end of the year?&quot; (Deut. 11:12). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many in Israel are disheartened. 
    The situation grows more serious from day to day. According to reliable sources, 
    the Barak government's &quot;peace agreement&quot; includes plans to implement 
    drastic measures in the near future, such as: The compulsory transfer of 50,000 
    Jews from their homes in Judea and Samaria; the transfer of large tracts of 
    the Jordan Valley to the Palestinian Authority; and the complete abandonment 
    of the Temple Mount to the hands of the Palestinians. Our government apparently 
    grows tired of pretending that &quot;the Temple Mount is in our hands&#133;&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A hostile Palestinian state, whose 
    objective is the destruction of Israel and who claims Jerusalem as its capital, 
    is no longer on the horizon. It is at our doorstep, steadily creeping towards 
    the Temple Mount. This bodes ill for all to whom Jerusalem is precious. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most seem to feel that there is 
    no cause for alarm; after all, they point out, the Jewish people have been 
    through greater difficulties. But on Shavuot night, the prevalent custom is 
    to remain awake the entire night, studying the holy Torah, in preparation 
    for the morning of the Festival, when we receive it anew, like our ancestors 
    did at Mount Sinai. One reason for this custom of not sleeping, is based on 
    the Midrash which teaches that way back on that first morning of Shavuot, 
    the people of Israel overslept at the foot of Mount Sinai. They had to be 
    woken by G-d - and arrived late to the most important event of their lives: 
    the giving of the Torah. Thus every year we remain awake on this night, to 
    rectify that blunder. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a message of Shavuot that 
    we must live with, here and now: We have a G-d given constitution, a Divine 
    manifesto...in short, a contract with G-d. That contract is the Torah, which 
    we, the Jewish people, have been entrusted to keep, preserve, and bring to 
    the world. It is in G-d and His Torah that we are to place our trust. But 
    we are now standing at the foot of the mountain, fast asleep. When will we 
    wake up? We dare not oversleep again. </font>Rabbi Chaim Richman THE TEMPLE
