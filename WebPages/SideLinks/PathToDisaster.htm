<p align="center">WORLD ON PATH TO DISASTER, BOMB PIONEER WARNS</p>

  Increased Risk of Atomic War</p>

  President George Bush, hijacked by hardliners in his administration, is setting 
  the world on a course towards nuclear disaster, a founder of the nuclear deterrence 
  policy said. The 1995 Nobel peace laureate, Professor Sir Joseph Rotblat, accused 
  the US of developing a policy which regarded nuclear weapons as bad if in the 
  possession of some states or groups but good if they were kept by the US for 
  the sake of world security. </p>
<p>The fact that it had signed the non-proliferation treaty and was legally bound 
  to the elimination of nuclear weapons was ignored, he told the Guardian-sponsored 
  non-proliferation conference, jointly hosted by the Royal United Services Institute 
  for Defence Studies and Physicians for Social Responsibility. </p>
<p>&quot;Nuclear arsenals will have to be retained indefinitely, not just as a 
  weapon of last resort, or as a deterrent against a nuclear attack, but as an 
  ordinary tool in the military armoury, to be used in the resolution of conflicts, 
  and even in pre-emptive strikes, should political contingencies demand it. &quot;This 
  is in essence the current US nuclear policy, and I see it as a very dangerous 
  policy.&quot; </p>
<p>Sir Joseph said that Mr Bush had already authorised the development of a new 
  nuclear warhead of low yield but with a shape that would give it a high power 
  to penetrate concrete, the so-called &quot;bunker-busting mini-nuke&quot;. This 
  would have to be tested. If the US resumed nuclear testing, it would give a 
  signal to China to do the same. Other new arrivals to the nuclear club, such 
  as India and Pakistan would use the window of opportunity created by Washington 
  to do the same. &quot;The danger of a new nuclear arms race is real,&quot; Sir 
  Joseph said. </p>
<p>India's declared policy was not to use nuclear weapons first, but if the US 
  made pre-emptive attacks part of its doctrine it would give India the legitimacy 
  to carry out a pre-emptive strike against Pakistan. Taiwan represented another 
  potential trigger for pre-emptive nuclear strikes by the US and now so too did 
  North Korea, which might already be in possession of two nuclear warheads. Israel, 
  which kept nuclear weapons and would not allow their acquisition by other countries 
  in the Middle East, had destroyed the Iraqi Osiraq reactor, the first case of 
  a pre-emptive strike on a nuclear installation. </p>
<p>The glaring asymmetry of the US in its relations with Israel and the Palestinians 
  was being exploited by radical groups in the Arab world. He said: &quot;By utilising 
  the tremendous advances in technology for military purposes, the United States 
  has built up an overwhelming military superiority, exceeding many-fold the combined 
  military strength of all other nations. &quot;It is claimed that this is necessary 
  for world security, but actually what such a policy amounts to is to rest the 
  security of the world on a balance of terror.&quot; </p>
<p>Arms control, he said, was as good as dead. The only way out of the disaster 
  that lay ahead was to put the goal of total nuclear disarmament back on the 
  agenda. &quot;We have to convince the public that the continuation of current 
  policies, in which the security of the world is maintained by the indefinite 
  retention of nuclear weapons, is not realistic in the long run, because it is 
  bound eventually to result in a nuclear holocaust in which the future of the 
  human race would be at stake. &quot;We must convince public opinion that the 
  only alternative is the total elimination of nuclear weapons.&quot; </p>
<p>Sir Joseph, Polish-born, was one of the first physicists in Britain to start 
  work on the bomb. He developed the concept of nuclear deterrence before the 
  second world war began, and carried out research on the feasibility of the bomb 
  with James Chadwick in Liverpool in November 1939, two months after the start 
  of the war. He said: &quot;It was not until much later that I realised the fallacy 
  of the nuclear deterrence concept, but at that time I thought that only by possessing 
  the bomb could we prevent a Nazi victory. &quot;I did not contemplate and never 
  condoned the use actual use of the bomb. This was the basis for my work in the 
  UK and later on the Manhattan Project in the US.&quot; The Guardian, Thursday
