<p align="center"><font size="+2">(And the Colossus of Baghdad).</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">George Bush's American armies have now marched 
  triumphantly into Baghdad, toppling not only the regime of the brutal dictator 
  but the colossal image of Saddam itself. The whole world watched as it was pulled 
  from its pedestal into the street. There was more to this event, however, than 
  readily caught the eye. The whole world watched as the image broke and the Two 
  Feet of the colossus were left intact at the base. The Two Feet tell the story. 
  It is a much greater Image than Saddam's that will topple as a result of this 
  invasion.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>The king of Babylon's dream, the Image of the Great Colossus (as well 
    as his vision of the Great Tree in Daniel, chapter 4), is directly related 
    to the Image of Christ (and the mystery of the true King), suspended on the 
    limbs of the Cosmic Tree. It tries to supplant it. (Understand Daniel 4:10,11). 
    The Four kingdoms in this dream, which appear one after the other, are the 
    Babylonian (the Head of Gold), the Persian, the Greek, and the fourth, the 
    Roman empire which extended its domain right up to that hidden place in the 
    center of Europe (present day Vienna, Austria). It was here that the Seventh 
    empire (the Holy Roman Empire) was established. God toppled this empire in 
    the world wars of 20th century, but not before Europe literally sailed away 
    to the Feet of this great mystery in the West, thus the words at Revelation 
    17:9-14 (KJV).</b></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">This is the dream, and we will tell the interpretation 
    thereof before the king.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">THOU, O KING, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven 
    hath given thee a kingdom, power, strength, and glory. </font></i>(Please 
    see the subchapter entitled Cain and Nimrod)<i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of 
    the field and the fowls of heaven hath He given into thy hand, and hath made 
    thee ruler over them all. THOU ART THIS HEAD OF GOLD. </font></i>(The king 
    of ancient Babylon is the head of gold)<i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to 
    thee </font></i>(this is the kingdom of the Medes and Persians)<i><font size="+1">, 
    and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth 
    </font></i>(this is the Grecian kingdom of Alexander the Great)<font size="+1">.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the Fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch 
    as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things, shall it break in pieces 
    and bruise.</font></i> (This is the Roman Empire, one of the Seven empires 
    that will eventually culminate in the establishment of the most powerful empire 
    of all--the United States of America in the 20th century)<i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And whereas thou sawest the Feet and Toes, part of potter's 
    clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided </font></i>(the Feet 
    and Toes of this Image represent the two sefirot on the Tree of Life numbered 
    Seven and Eight and named Endurance and Majesty)<i><font size="+1">; but there 
    shall be in it of the strength of iron </font></i>(like the Roman empire)<i><font size="+1">, 
    forasmuch as you sawest iron mixed with the miry clay. </font></i>(The iron 
    represents the might and power of the American order of things, while the 
    clay represents the children of God who are being molded and fired to perfection 
    in the great furnace of their own spiritual afflictions...Jeremiah, chapter 
    18; 1 Peter 1:7; 4:12,13)<font size="+1">.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And as the toes of the Feet were part of iron, and part 
    of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. </font></i>(The 
    weak and broken parts are those who are nevertheless destined to inherit the 
    earth and the kingdom of God)<i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they 
    </font></i>(the powerful ones)<i><font size="+1"> shall mingle themselves 
    with the seed of men </font></i>(with the true children of Adam--the sons 
    and daughters of Light)<i><font size="+1">, but they shall not cleave one 
    to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven 
    set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not 
    be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these 
    kingdoms, and it shall stand forever...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel

  THAT JUSTIFIES WAR</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By G. Thomas Goodnight</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Heroes fall. Statues topple. Regimes 
    change. IMAGES FLOWED YESTERDAY FROM THE CENTER OF BAGHDAD, where the great 
    bronze statue of Saddam Hussein was pulled down by an enthusiastic crowd and 
    an M88 tank recovery vehicle. There the world media paused, and with sustained, 
    single-minded focus punctuated history.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTHING LESS THAN A DEFINING MOMENT 
    OF OUR TIMES WAS SHOWN FOR THE WORLD TO SEE: images comparable to the billowing 
    ticker tape of New York's homecoming parades of World War I, the flowers and 
    kisses of the crowd during the liberation of Paris or the raucous parties 
    of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The first images of peace climax the great 
    wars and anticipate euphoric celebration.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yesterday the world witnessed live 
    what appears to be peace breaking out. Liberated crowds chanted, &quot;USA! 
    USA! USA!&quot; Hussein's bronzed head was severed and dragged through Baghdad's 
    streets. The success of the &quot;new war&quot; had been proven...FOR THE 
    BUSH ADMINISTRATION, HUNGRY TO HAVE ITS WAR AGAINST IRAQ VIEWED AS LIBERATION, 
    NOT CONQUEST, THE STATUE SCENE WAS NEARLY PICTURE PERFECT...</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And they worshipped the Dragon which gave power unto the 
    beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? 
    who is able to make war with him?</font></i><font size="+1">...(Revelation 
    13:4).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The central Baghdad images yesterday 
    produced the first proof for the first premise of the war: Hussein's regime 
    is doomed. Those celebrating did not know if the dictator was dead or alive. 
    The corporeal existence of Hussein mattered less than the moment. STATE STATUES 
    SYMBOLIZE CIVIC AUTHORITY, ITS HISTORY AND RULE, AND IN AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE 
    THESE REPRESENTATIONS MULTIPLY FINGERS OF POWER. STATUE AND HERO ARE INTIMATELY 
    CONNECTED TERMS. BACK TO ANTIQUITY, LOCAL HEROES HAVE STOOD IN STATUARY AS 
    CIVIC FOUNDERS, THEIR IMAGES HONORED. TO TAKE DOWN A STATUE IS TO TOPPLE A 
    HERO. IT IS ALWAYS A FATAL INSTANT WHEN IDOLS FALL AND DISRESPECT IS OPENLY 
    DISPLAYED...</font></p>

    shoes and Americans freelanced disrespect, pulling an American flag over the

    synecdoche for regime collapse and the completion of a 10-YEAR-OLD confrontation 
    with the Bush presidencies...That is what President George W. Bush promised.

    THOUGH, A POSTWAR WORLD IS AT HAND, AND IN SUCH TRANSISTIONS IMAGES WILL PLAY 
    AN IMPORTANT ROLE. War can be broadcast as a spectacular: flashing lights, 
    racing tanks, thundering rockets--and even falling statues. But memories of 
    war are filled with trauma too, for soldiers and civilians alike. So just 
    as the world has seen THE POWER OF AMERICAN ARMS, so compelling symbols of 
    its goodness are needed...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Iraq war is ending as its doomed 
    regime no longer comes to work. But hard work remains--as much to define the 
    conflict as to deal with its material consequences. A bronze idol can be pulled 
    down in triumph. However, it must not be forgotten that winning the war with 
    Iraq is not the same as winning the war on terror. The Hussein statue is scattered 
    among the debris of war--a fallen idol, a last memory and a reminder of the

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notes From Russia: 
  Beware of Falling Statues</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Solomon Volkov</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is almost certain that the toppling 
    yesterday of Saddam Hussein's giant statue in the center of Badhdad will be 
    considered in retrospect as one of the iconic images of the present war in 
    Iraq. As I watched this scene unfolding on television, similar episodes from 
    the not-so-distant yet already faintly hazy past, sprang to my mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First of course, there was the 
    1989 demolition of the Berlin Wall, which for years divided Germany into the 
    socialist East and the capitalist West. Watching that evening unfold on TV, 
    one could feel the almost palpable physical excitement as youthful drunks 
    madly clawed and hammered away at the hated symbol of this enforced division.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, on an August night in 1991, 
    another statue came down. This time </font>(besides the statues of Lenin and 
    Stalin that came down)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> it was the 
    bronze of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Soviet secret police which 
    had presided over central Moscow since 1958. One saw the same excitement but 
    markedly less merriment, and the crowd looked more mature, even sober. They 
    had thought ahead, going to the trouble of bringing five cranes for the job. 
    These people were exacting what felt like an intellectual revenge for the 
    years of living in fear, of being able to talk candidly only with trusted 
    friends--and then only in a whisper. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A parenthetical thought: lately, 
    parallels have been drawn in the press between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and the 
    repressive Communists who ruled Russia. </font>(I trust the next set of comparisons 
    will come into view)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. I think an 
    important difference between the two regimes was revealed when the solidity 
    of the comparative statues was tested. The Soviet one had to be dragged away 
    WITH MUCH EFFORT, EXERTION, ETC. AND WHEN IT CAME DOWN, IT CAME DOWN IN ONE 
    PIECE. IN CONTRAST, THE IRAQI MONUMENT TOPPLED QUITE EASILY. AND WHEN IT DID, 
    IT BROKE APART, LEAVING THE HOLLOW BOOTS OF THE DICTATOR ON THE PEDESTAL...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for Russia, there is now persistent 
    talk coming from Moscow's conservative mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, that the statue 
    of Dzerzhinsky (which conveniently survived intact and has been living a quiet 
    life in a Moscow park) should be returned to its former home--a traffic island 
    in front of the headquarters of the former KGB and its successor, the Federal 
    Security Services </font>(hmmm, this has a familiar ring)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The liberal intelligentsia, of course, vehemently objects to the resurrection. 
    But with polls showing that more and more Russians are looking on the Soviet 
    past with fondness, there is a distinct possibility that one day we will see 
    the once-toppled monument back at the heart of Moscow, gazing imperiously 
    at passers-by.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if this happened, one question 
    in particular would gnaw at me: is it possible that among those who restored 
    the statue, there were also some who helped to bring it down? </font>The New 
    York Times<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Now reverse the question. Is it possible that those who helped 
  set up the great colossus of Daniel, chapter 2, here on its base of power at 
  the Western ends of the earth, will also be among those who help to bring it 
  down? And then the question follows: What has the return to the old order in 
  Russia (and the rise of China behind it) to do with the fall of the Great Image 
  itself? Every much so, as it is written:</font></p>

    some 2500 ( or 7 X 365) years ago. He was a Jew who lived the majority of

    end can be found. Yet even he was not allowed by God to understand how or 
    when these prophecies would come about. The last chapter of the book of Daniel

    to create another uniquely satisfying combination of suspense and substance. 
    I base this exciting story on the single most important prophecy in the Bible 
    regarding international events, one that is having an incredible impact on 
    our society today.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bible prophecies and their interpretations 
    are clear signs of what our present and future hold for this world, and they 
    are a continuing basis for all of my writing. In the Babylon Rising series, 
    you will find some truly fascinating and important material based on my continuing 
    research on the prophecies of the Bible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My hope is that you will not only 
    find <i>Babylon Rising</i> a fascinating read, but that the series will help 
    you understand that end times prophecy could be fulfilled in our lifetime, 
    and that it will help you make sense of &quot;the signs of the times&quot; 
    that we see being fulfilled internationally almost every time we watch events 
    unfold on television or read a newspaper.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The setting for <i>Left behind</i>, 
    as you probably know, starts with the rapture of the church and then takes 
    the world through the tribulation period, the millennial kingdom of Christ, 
    and on into heaven. <i>Babylon Rising</i> starts in our present time and moves 
    forward to the rapture, one of the most exciting periods in the history of 
    the world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To really make this a &quot;grabber&quot; 
    of a novel, you will find <i>Babylon Rising</i> features a hero who faces 
    many of the challenges of our day that are familiar to all of us. That hero, 
    Michael Murphy, is one of the real appeals of this series for me...There are 
    many wonders in our world, but many dangers as well, and I wanted to center 
    this series on a hero who I think is very engaging yet very real, and somehow 
    who is up to the task of confronting a rising tide of danger throughout the 
    books.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Murphy is a scholar in both archaeology 
    and Biblical prophecy, but unlike other scholars, he is also a complete adventurer 
    and risk-taker when he is on the trail of ancient artifacts, that can help 
    further authenticate the truth of the Bible. Murphy is a man of action and 
    a man of faith, a true hero for our times-which is a good thing, because as 
    you will see right from the start of this series, Murphy will begin to confront 
    a profound evil. An evil force he will soon discover has ensnared him in a 
    countdown to what the Bible calls &quot;the time of the end.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thank you for your interest in 
    my work. Starting with this volume, my hope is that you come to feel as I 
    do that Babylon Rising is a real page-turning series that manages to be both 
    a totally absorbing story and extremely relevant to our times.</font></p>
