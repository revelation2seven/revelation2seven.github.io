<p><b> This is a good essay about the symbolism of the staff:</b></p>
<p><b>Many intriguing legends surround the mysterious Sapphire Staff. According 
  to the Kabbalah, the Archangel Raziel gave the Sapphire Staff to Adam and Eve 
  when they left the Garden of Eden. This staff of knowledge was said to contain 
  the secrets of God and was designed to help Adam and Eve on their journey through 
  life, to point the way to becoming a true human being and reconnect with the 
  Divine source.</b></p>
<p><b>This knowledge was then passed down through the generations, from Abraham 
  to Isaac to Jacob and then to Joseph, who had become one of top advisors to 
  the Egyptian Pharaoh. When Joseph died in Egypt, legend says that Jethro, another 
  of the Pharaoh's advisors, then took the staff. When Jethro returned to his 
  land, it came to pass that he was walking with the staff in his garden one day 
  when he stuck it into the ground. But when he tried to pull it out, Jethro discovered 
  it had sprouted roots and was blooming. From then on no one could uproot the 
  Staff/Tree. It was said that the One who could easily take it would not only 
  receive Jethro's daughter in marriage, but would be the redeemer of Israel.</b></p>
<p><b>And so the story goes that Moses, who was in the line of Abraham, fled Egypt, 
  and eventually found himself in the land of Jethro. Because he was eager to 
  marry Jethro's daughter, Zipporah, Moses was challenged to go into Jethro's 
  garden and attempt to uproot the Staff/Tree. (The Tree had devoured all other 
  suitors.) Moses went to the Tree, and easily pulled it out of the ground, thus 
  winning Zipporah's hand in marriage, reclaiming the great staff of knowledge 
  to which he was the rightful heir and activating his destiny, to become redeemer 
  of Israel. (This is a paraphrased story from &quot;Sepher HaAggada&quot;)</b></p>
<p><b>From the legend, we see how the Tree and Staff are interchangeable symbols, 
  transforming miraculously from one into the other throughout time. The original 
  staff emerges from the Divine Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, which then 
  transforms into a staff for Adam and Eve to take with them. This staff then 
  transforms back into a Tree of Life in Jethro's garden and subsequently changes 
  back into a staff for Moses to carry with him on his journey of destiny</b></p>
<p><b>The hope we gain from this story is that the staff is also available to 
  us if we take it in hand and begin to walk the path of awakening. If we can 
  imagine our staff as one branch from the Great, Divine Tree of Life, we can 
  see that it is designed specially for us, guiding us on our own journey of discovery 
  and destiny. This is no ordinary staff, made of ordinary wood, but an extraordinary 
  staff made of sapphires, translucent crystal, shining as if from a star. </b></p>
<p><b>Sapphires are typically known as precious stones of blue. However, sapphires 
  do appear in a variety of rainbow colors, including orange, yellow, red, green, 
  blue, violet, white and even black. (These rainbow colors are notably associated 
  with the chakras. In Kabbalah they are referred to centers of consciousness.) 
  The Hebrew word for sapphire is &quot;sappir&quot;, and is closely associated 
  with &quot;sephirah&quot;, the divine qualities such as truth, justice and mercy, 
  decorating the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, growing on the Tree like shining jewels 
  of fruit. </b></p>
<p><b>The Sephirah on the Tree associated with blue, the color most powerfully 
  connected with the sapphire, is &quot;Daat&quot;, the place of knowledge, transformation 
  and vision. It is also associated with the third eye, the place of mystical 
  awakening. Therefore, the Sapphire Staff is a symbol for the knowledge that 
  transforms us into an awakened, enlightened state. </b></p>
<p><b>Continuing with the story of Moses and the Sapphire Staff, it is said that 
  Moses began using this staff to tend his flocks of sheep. For many years he 
  shepherded and apprenticed with Jethro until one day, his life changed in a 
  dramatic way, as did the function of his shepherding staff. On that fateful 
  day, Moses was out tending his flock when he encountered the Divine in the form 
  of a burning bush. There he received his calling to redeem Israel by returning 
  to Egypt to liberate his people from slavery (Exodus 3:16 - 4:5). </b></p>
<p><b>Moses wondered how in the world he would fulfill this task, so God told 
  Moses to throw down his staff and when he did, it became a serpent. God then 
  told Moses to pick up the serpent by the tail. When he did, it became a staff 
  once again. In order to show that the Divine had appeared to him, and sent him 
  to do this enormous task, his staff was activated into a staff of wonders, imbued 
  with divine power. The staff was now a powerful tool to help Moses accomplish 
  his purpose and destiny, offering him support on the journey and skills to complete 
  his mission.</b></p>
<p><b>After fulfilling his role as redeemer of Israel, Moses then passed down 
  the knowledge of mystical awakening and skills for conscious living to the next 
  generation and so on after him. The modern form of this body of knowledge comes 
  to us in the Kabbalistic glyphs of the Tree of Life and Jacob's Ladder. It is 
  said that the Sapphire Staff corresponds to the central pillar of consciousness 
  and is the most direct path of self-knowledge and connection to the Divine. 
  The Sapphire Staff as the central pillar points the way like a compass guiding 
  us step by step on the initiation journey so that we can, like Moses, awaken 
  to our calling and true purpose in life and gain the skills needed to accomplish 
  this task.</b></p>
