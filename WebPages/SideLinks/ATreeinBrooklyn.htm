    <blockquote> 
      <p><font size="+1">There's a tree that grows in Brooklyn. Some people call 
        it the Tree of Heaven. No matter where its seed falls, it makes a tree 
        which struggles to reach the sky. In grows in boarded-up lots and out 
        of neglected rubbish heaps. It grows out of cellar gratings. It is the 
        only tree that grows out of cement. It grows lushly...survives without 
        sun, water, and seemingly without earth. It would be considered beautiful 
        except that there are too many of it.</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">SERENE was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York. Especially 
    in the summer of 1912. Somber, as a word, was better. But it did not apply 
    to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Prairie was lovely and Shenandoah had a beautiful 
    sound, but you couldn't fit those words into Brooklyn. Serene was the only 
    word for it; especially on a saturday afternoon in summer.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Late in the afternoon the sun slanted down into the mossy 
    yard belonging to Francie Nolan's house, and warmed the worn wooden fence. 
    Looking at the shafted sun, Francie had the same feeling that came when she 
    recalled the poem they recited in school.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><i><font size="+1">This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and 
        hemlocks,</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct 
        in the twilight,</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">Stand like Druids of eld.</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">You took a walk on a Sunday afternoon and came to a nice 
    neighborhood, very refined. You saw a small one of these trees through the 
    iron gate leading to someone's yard, and you knew that soon that section of 
    Brooklyn would get to be a tenement district. The tree knew. It came there 
    first. Afterwards, poor foreigners seeped in and the quiet old brownstone 
    houses were hacked up into flats, feather beds were pushed out the window 
    sills to air and the Tree of Heaven flourished. That was the kind of tree 
    it was. It liked poor people...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Oh what a wonderful day was saturday in Brooklyn. Oh, how 
    wonderful anywhere! people were paid on Saturday and it was a holiday without 
    the rigidness of a Sunday. People had money to go out and buy things. They 
    ate well for once, got drunk, had dates, made love and stayed up until all 
    hours; singing, playing music, fighting and dancing because the morrow was 
    their own free day. They could sleep late--until late mass anyhow.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">On Sunday, most people crowded into the eleven o'clock mass. 
    Well some people, a few went to early six o'clock mass. They were given credit 
    for this but they deserved none for they were the ones who had stayed out 
    so late that it was morning when they got home. So they went to this early 
    mass, got it over with and went home and slept all day with a free conscience.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">For Francie, Saturday started with a trip to the junkie. 
    She and her brother, Neely, like other Brooklyn kids, collected rags, paper, 
    metal, rubber, and other junk, and hoarded it in locked cellar bins and or 
    in boxes hidden under beds...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Francie walked up Manhatten Avenue reading aloud the fine-sounding 
    names of the streets she passed: Scholes, Meserole, Montrose, and then Johnson 
    Avenue. These last two avenues were where the Italians had settled. The district 
    called Jew Town started at Seigel Street, took in Moore and McKibben and went 
    past Broadway. Francie headed for Broadway.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">And what was on Broadway in Williamsburg, Brooklyn? Nothing--only 
    the finest nickel and dime store in all the world! It was big and glittering 
    and had everything in the world in it...or so it seemed to an eleven year-old 
    girl. Francie had a nickel. Francie had power. She could buy practically anything 
    in that store. It was the only place in the world where that could be...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">She walked back home down Graham Avenue, the Ghetto street. 
    She was excited by the filled pushcarts--each a little store in itself--the 
    bargaining, the emotional Jews and the peculiar smells of the neighborhood; 
    baked stuffed fish, sour rye bread fresh from the oven, and something that 
    smelled like honey boiling. She stared at the bearded men in their alpaca 
    skull caps and silkolene coats and wondered what made their eyes so small 
    and fierce. She looked into the tiny hole-in-the-wall shops and smelled the 
    dress fabrics arranged in disorder on the tables. She noticed the feather 
    beds bellying out of windows, clothes of Oriental-bright colors drying on 
    the fire-escapes and the half-naked children playing in the gutters. A woman, 
    big-with-child, sat patiently at the curb in a stiff wooden chair. She sat 
    in the hot sunshine watching the life on the street and guarding within herself, 
    her own mystery of life.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Francie remembered her surprise that time when mama told 
    her that Jesus was a Jew. Francie had thought that he was a Catholic. But 
    mama knew. Mama said that the Jews had never looked on Jesus as anything but 
    a troublesome Yiddish boy who would not work at the carpentry trade, marry, 
    settle down, and raise a family. And the Jews believed that their Messiah 
    was yet to come, mama said. Thinking of this, Francie stared at the Pregnant 
    Jewess.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">&quot;I guess that's why the Jews have so many babies,&quot; 
    Francie thought. &quot;And why they sit so quiet...waiting. And why they aren't 
    ashamed the way they are fat. Each one thinks that she might be making the 
    real little Jesus. That's why they walk so proud when they're that way. Now 
    the Irish women always looked so ashamed. They know that they can never make 
    a Jesus. It will be just another Mick. When I grow up and know that I am going 
    to have a baby, I will remember to walk proud and slow even though I am not 
    a Jew.&quot;</font></p>
