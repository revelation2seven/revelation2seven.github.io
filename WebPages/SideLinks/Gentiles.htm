    <blockquote> <i><font size="+1">Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister 
      of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto 
      the fathers;</font></i>
<p><font size="+1">And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy; 
        <i> as it is written: </i>For this cause will I confess to thee among 
        the Gentiles, <i>and sing unto thy Name. </i>(2 Samuel 22:50; Psalm 18:49)...</font></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">And again he saith, </font></i><font size="+1">Rejoice 
        ye Gentiles, with His people. (Deut.32:43)...</font></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">And again, </font></i><font size="+1">Praise the Lord 
        all ye Gentiles; <i>and laud Him all ye people. </i>(Psalm 117:1)...</font></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">And again, Esaias saith, </font></i><font size="+1">There 
        shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall reign over the Gentiles; in 
        him shall the Gentiles trust. (Isaiah 11:10)...</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">And the Gentiles shall come to thy Light, and kings 
        to the Brightness of Thy Rising...</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">And the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto 
        thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah 
        60:1-6).</font></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found 
        of them that sought me not; I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation 
        that was not called by my Name...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah 65:1).</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font size="+1">And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, AND WILL KEEP 
        THE PASSOVER UNTO THE LORD; according to the ordinance of the Passover, 
        and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: YE SHALL HAVE ONE 
        ORDINANCE, BOTH FOR THE STRANGER, AND FOR HIM THAT IS BORN IN THE LAND...(Numbers 
        9:14).</font></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">For there is no respect of persons with God.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">For as many as have sinned without law shall also 
        perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged 
        by the law;</font></i></p>
      <p><font size="+1">For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but 
        the doers of the law shall be justified.</font></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do 
        by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, 
        are a law unto themselves;</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, 
        their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile 
        accusing or excusing one another;</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">In the day that God shall judge the secrets of men 
        by Jesus Christ according to my gospel...</font></i><font size="+1">(Romans 
        2:11-16). </font></p>
