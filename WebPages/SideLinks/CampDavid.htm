<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">It was community at its best. On Friday evening, the 17th 
    of November, 200l, a group of individuals, all of whom met at Union Square 
    in New York City after the events of September 11th, met together again at 
    an upstate farmhouse near Claverack, N.Y. to form a circle of friends and 
    a spiritual fellowship whose hopefully-unbroken connection will culminate 
    in the great gathering in the wilderness, foretold in the Revelation. Those 
    of you who were there, and those of you who were there in spirit, please make 
    note of yourselves. It was a day of <i>small </i>but sacred <i>beginnings</i>. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The weekend began for most of us in Harlem, where we loaded 
    our stuff in the several cars at our disposal, and divided ourselves up for 
    the drive through the Bronx and Westchester County toward the Taghanic Parkway 
    and that old, empty farmhouse in Columbia County. It was late in the evening 
    when we arrived. Mike, Amina and Chris went on to the local shopping center 
    while the rest of us went and opened up the house, put on the lights and got 
    the heat going. It is a large old house, with nine bedrooms and enough beds 
    and couches, and space on the floor, for a whole group of people, and even 
    more when the heart and mind between them all is right as it was this weekend. 
    Kerith and Spirit arrived on their own about an hour later, and Crissy and 
    Taryn arrived the next day. There was room around the kitchen table for everyone. 
    By 1 or 2am everyone had found a place to be, and after the last conversations 
    faded the lights were out. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Those who got up first on Saturday morning thought they were 
    the first, until Xiao-you suddenly came through the door, having already been 
    up and out for more than an hour, walking through the fields and orchards 
    across the road, greeting the Sun with an offering of prayer and Tai-chi. 
    The tea pot was on, Mike and Lisa were back with the rolls and the donuts, 
    and the conversations and study time that lasted on and off throughout the 
    day had begun. As each awoke they appeared to warm greetings and the breakfast 
    that Alisha was preparing for everyone. The spirit of love, and the absence 
    of ego, was evident the whole weekend. It was community at its best. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">By mid-morning almost everyone was around the tabel, discussing 
    the implications of recent events, the meaning of our being together, and 
    studying a sequence of scriptural texts that led to an understanding of that 
    number in the Revelation, which allows those who can come to it the ability 
    to distinguish between the spirits of Light and Darkness--Christ and Antichrist--in 
    our times. The discussions led to the subject of war, capitalism, and the 
    environment, and the proper attitude the sons and daughters of Light should 
    take toward each. Once the spirit of Darkness is discerned for what, or should 
    we say, for who it is, (and everyone had already brought a very well-developed 
    sense of that with them), then it is plain to see that we as the children 
    of Light are not allowed to participate in the first two, (war or capitalism--even 
    though we all agreed that for the time being we are all stuck in the latter, 
    but our hearts were innocent of it all), nor in the ongoing destruction of 
    the third. There was much talk of indigenous spirituality and the sanctity 
    of all things. The conversation turned to the meaning of relationships, soul 
    mates, of course sexuality, and the nature of God in Their role as Mother 
    and Father. When it was suggested that this be called the first (true) Camp 
    DVD Gathering, Alisha thought that there was too much of a male, and a historically 
    oppressive connotation attached to that name, and suggested it be called the 
    first Camp Sophia Gathering. Everyone seemed to agree that there was room 
    in our hearts for both understandings, being that the name DVD itself implies 
    the mystery of the Male and Feminine principles joined together in perfect 
    balance, and in perfect love one for another. By 1 or 2pm the conversations 
    were breaking up and everyone was thinking about a walk through the countryside, 
    or a nap. Mike and Amina, and the youngest among us, Michael James, Lisa and 
    Kerith, supper menu in hand, headed to the market. Xiao-you, Alisha and Lorrie 
    took the road toward the Berkshires, hoping to see some cows. They saw three. 
    Bernard and Serin, along with Chris, took the road west, toward the Catskills. 
    They found their way through some private fields, around a lake, to a place 
    in the woods where they took some of the many photographs that Serin took 
    this weekend, which we all hope to get to see. Lisa is also an accomplished 
    photographer, and took many photos of the September 29th antiwar gathering 
    in Washington in addition to the ones she took over this weekend. Kerith is 
    also a bit of a picture taker. Spirit joined those who returned in the ongoing 
    discussions in the kitchen. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Chris is an art student from Massachusetts, a gentle young 
    man insightful beyond his years. He is attuned to the teachings of Native 
    American elders. Spirit is from Vietnam--from heaven he says, (and he is right). 
    He lives an extremely intentional life, obeying and trusting God in all of 
    his ways. He lives in the Park, not because he has to, but because he chooses 
    to, ministering to himself, to the homeless and to those who harass the homeless 
    alike, and to us as well. He has a servant's heart and a warrior's mind. Bernard 
    is from Switzerland. His wife, Serin, is from Thailand. The two are friends 
    and soulmates. They are giving of themselves, quiet and gentle to others. 
    Bernard is a serious student of divine philosophy, and is subsequently astute 
    in in the ways of justice and insightful in the ways of unrighteousness. He 
    knows evil from good. They may have to leave the country if they cannot extend 
    their visitation. Lisa is a mature, giving, quick-minded lady, with a warm, 
    willing heart, and a searching spirit. She brings a serious dimension along 
    with a sense of humor to every conversation. She makes things work. Lorrie, 
    along with so many others who have been attuned to these things since the 
    early seventies, has been a longing part of this fellowship before it even 
    existed. She has been anticipating these events, and following them since 
    her sojourn through the back-to-the-land movement, but also through the many 
    spiritual frustrations of the last thirty years. She gives, and she has endured. 
    Alisha is also an old soul, concerned for the plight and for the soul of her 
    black people, for the poor, and for the rights of women-kind. She was just 
    baptised after all these years. She draws on many experiences. She is an earth 
    mother. Cristy is just love, pure, giving, trusting, unpresumptuous love. 
    She radiates the joy of youth, but also a sense of the seriousness of these 
    times. She is a playwright and can see into the heart without judging. She 
    is &quot;yes,&quot; and not &quot;no.&quot; Taryn is originally from Miami, 
    as are Lisa and Cristy, but has spent time in Russia. She added another kind 
    spirit to the gathering. She and Cristy were heading for the Berkshires before 
    the weekend was over...or somewhere. Kerith was among the several teachers 
    at the gathering. She was one of the first to arrive at Union Square after 
    the events of the 11th, and was a member of the drum circle that set the tone 
    for all the following events that took place there. She led us all in a yoga 
    lesson on Saturday evening. As we were assembling in a circle, candles lit 
    in the center, I related the last words of my brother whose house it is: &quot;Now 
    you people are not going to have one of those cult meeting up there are you?&quot; 
    Everyone laughed. Kerith is both a student and a teacher in the science of 
    yoga and the methods of raising the forces of Kundalini. Xiao-you is from 
    China. She was in Tianamen Square on the day of the massacre. She is a radical 
    student of the things of God, obedient to the Spirit, innocent of guile, willingly 
    vulnerable, hungry for the truth, and proficient in all the ways of Eastern 
    (Taoist) thought. She knows how to make connections between the higher worlds 
    and the lower. She is humble, with a great sense of humor. Amina is from the 
    Dominican Republic, and until she gave birth to her first child less than 
    two months ago was a traditional middle school teacher in the Bronx. She is 
    going through the most amount of changes, and quickly. She is warm, giving 
    and hospitable to every one, and will enhance the character of this fellowship 
    with her own perspectives and her own fire. Her husband, Michael, has been 
    both a faithful student and a teacher of these things since before they came 
    to pass. He has leaned in his own life towards both, the ways of monastic 
    life and the ways of the world. Between them he has found the higher teachings 
    of the Kabbalah, his own way back to God, the mysteries of the Middle Pillar, 
    and has submitted himself to the disciplines of the tantric path. Along with 
    this whole fellowship he is unimpeded by dogma, free in the Spirit, and obedient 
    to Love.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Tim and Maia were not there in person, but the candle burning 
    there throughout the weekend testified to their presence in spirit, along 
    with so many others in this circle who could not be there. Tim is largely 
    responsible for all of the work on the website. He and Maia, along with Alex, 
    though they reside now in the San Francisco Bay Area, drove across the country 
    and were there in Union Square throughout all of the events of September 11th, 
    recording it all, making connections, and are now preparing and editing footage 
    for a video that they will soon add to their work on the site. Tim and Maia 
    bring a strong balance to this fellowship. Each of them are musicians, and 
    she is a songwriter, as are so many others in this circle. They are the West 
    coast connection. John and Dawn were not there, nor Jamie who performs with 
    a downtown theater group on Saturday evenings, nor Tyrone and his lady, nor 
    Alex from Queens and his small circle of friends. Who can imagine what the 
    holy energy would have been like if all the children of Light we met on the 
    Square--Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists--were there this weekend. 
    We pray that it will all come together in the near future, as events in the 
    world continue to unfold. And, of course, there are the folks in Richmond, 
    and the fellowship in West Virginia--Sharon and Debby, Vickey and Colleen, 
    Pam and Nora, all the brothers and sisters, friends and family, who have been 
    watching and waiting for these things to come to pass for more than just a 
    few years. Who could have continued without them? And there is Elaine and 
    her daughters. She delivers mail upstate and had to work this weekend. She 
    went to Washington with all of us. She created a poster which her daughter 
    Amy held up. It had pictures of Afghani children with the words: WANTED, ALIVE. 
    Every one has brought their own special treasure, their own personal gifts, 
    to the center of this circle. God is present in every one. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The highlight for many was the brilliant and magical meteor 
    shower that appeared during the early hours on Sunday morning. Like the towers 
    falling, they seemed to be part of the surreal mindscape the Spirit is creating 
    all around us in our time, confirming our collective and mystical sense of 
    it all. On our way back to New York City on Sunday some us visited an equally 
    magical place, a sacred falls, a cathedral built of water and stone by Nature 
    Herself. Amina and Michael baptised their son, Michael James, (Mi'hal Seamus--Miguel 
    Diego), there, dedicating him to the pursuit of God's Wisdom and Nature's 
    Beauty throughout all the days of his life. We all witnessed the words that 
    Mike and Alisha spoke over him as he was consecrated into the great circle 
    of spiritual life. Xiao-you kept us all in stitches on the way home relating 
    stories of her growing up in China during the years of the Cultural Revolution. 
    She has arrived here in the West in time to be part of the great Spiritual 
    Revolution that shall emerge out of the repressions that will soon grip America 
    as God continues to judge this nation for all of its warring and capitalistic 
    ways. What is the difference between America and China, or any of the other 
    nations of the world? America works its Darkness in the name of Christ. This 
    is forbidden. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">We pray that the circle will grow. We will sow the seeds, 
    but only God can can provide the increase. </font></p>
