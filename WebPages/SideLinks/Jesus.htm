  JESUS OF NAZARETH<br>
</p>
<p align="center"> By : Joseph Jacobs Kaufmann Kohler Richard Gottheil Samuel 
  Krauss </p>
<p>&#151;In History: </p>
<p>Founder of Christianity; born at Nazareth about 2 B.C. (according to Luke iii. 
  23); executed at Jerusalem 14th of Nisan, 3789 (March or April, 29 C.E.). His 
  life, though indirectly of so critical a character, had very little direct influence 
  on the course of Jewish history or thought. In contemporary Jewish literature 
  his career is referred to only in the (interpolated) passage of Josephus, &quot;Ant.&quot; 
  xviii. 3, &sect; 3, while the references in the Talmud are for the most part 
  as legendary as those in the apocryphal gospels, though in an opposite direction 
  (see Jesus in Jewish Legend). Under these circumstances it is not necessary 
  in this place to do more than to give a sketch of the main historical events 
  in the public career of Jesus, with an attempt to ascertain his personal relations 
  to contemporary Judaism; for the theological superstructure based upon his life 
  and death, and certain mythological conceptions associated with them, see Jew. 
  Encyc. iv. 50a, s.v. Christianity.</p>
<p>Sources of Life.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there are four &quot;Gospels&quot; professing to deal 
  with the life of Jesus independently; but it is now almost universally agreed 
  that the first three of these, known by the names of &quot;Matthew,&quot; &quot;Mark,&quot; 
  and &quot;Luke,&quot; are interdependent, corresponding to the various forms 
  of contemporary Baraitot, while the fourth, the Gospel of John, is what the 
  Germans call a &quot;Tendenz-Roman,&quot; practically a work of religious imagination 
  intended to modify opinion in a certain direction. The supernatural claims made 
  on behalf of Jesus are based almost exclusively on statements of the fourth 
  Gospel. Of the first three or synoptic Gospels the consensus of contemporary 
  opinion regards that of Mark as the earliest and as being the main source of 
  the historic statements of the other two. This Gospel will, therefore, be used 
  in the following account almost exclusively, references to chapter and verse, 
  when the name of the Gospel is not given, being to this source. Beside the original 
  of the Gospel of Mark, there was another source used in common by both Matthew 
  and Luke, namely the &quot;logia,&quot; or detached sayings, of Matthew and 
  Luke; and besides these two documents the apocryphal &quot;Gospel According 
  to the Hebrews&quot; has preserved, in the opinion of the critics, a few statements 
  of Jesus which often throw vivid light upon his motives and opinions. Much industry 
  and ingenuity have been devoted by A. Resch to the collection of extracanonical 
  statements of Jesus, known as &quot;agrapha&quot; (Leipsic, 1889).</p>
<p>The earliest of all these sources, the original of Mark's Gospel, contains 
  references which show that it was written shortly before or soon after the destruction 
  of Jerusalem in the year 70; in other words, forty years after the death of 
  Jesus. Like the other Gospels, it was originally written in Greek, whereas the 
  sayings of Jesus were uttered in Aramaic. It is therefore impossible to lay 
  much stress upon the perfect accuracy of the records of events and statements 
  written down forty years after they occurred or were made, and then in a language 
  other than that in which such statements were originally uttered (even the Lord's 
  Prayer was retained in variant versions; comp. Matt. vi. 10-13; Luke xi. 2-4); 
  yet it is upon this slender basis that some of the most stupendous claims have 
  been raised. For the processes by which the traditions as to the life of Jesus 
  were converted into proofs of his super-natural character, see Jew. Encyc. iv. 
  51-52, s.v. Christianity. Many incidents were actually invented (especially 
  in Matthew) &quot;in order that there might be fulfilled&quot; in him prophecies 
  relating to aMessiah of a character quite other than that of which Jesus either 
  claimed or was represented by his disciples to be.</p>
<p>Yet the supernatural in the life of Jesus according to the Gospels is restricted 
  to the smallest dimensions, consisting mainly of incidents and characteristics 
  intended to support these prophecies and the dogmatic positions of Christianity. 
  This applies especially to the story of the virgin-birth, a legend which is 
  common to almost all folk-heroes as indicating their superiority to the rest 
  of their people (see E. S. Hartland, &quot;Legend of Perseus,&quot; vol. i.). 
  Combined with this is the inconsistent claim of Davidic descent through Joseph, 
  two discrepant pedigrees being given (Matt. i., Luke iii.).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the life of Jesus as presented in the 
  Gospels is the utter silence about its earlier phases. He was one of a rather 
  large family, having four brothers, Jacob, Jose, Simon, Judah, besides sisters. 
  It is known that he earned his living by his father's trade, that of a carpenter; 
  according to Justin Martyr, plows and yokes made by Jesus were still in existence 
  at his (Justin's) time, about the year 120 (&quot;Dial. cum Tryph.&quot; &sect; 
  88). It is doubtful whether he received any definite intellectual training, 
  the great system of Jewish education not being carried into effect till after 
  the destruction of Jerusalem (see Education). It is probable, however, that 
  he could read; he was certainly acquainted, either by reading or by oral instruction, 
  with much of the Old Testament; and his mode of argumentation often resembles 
  that of the contemporary rabbis, implying that he had frequented their society. 
  In defending his infringement of the Sabbath he seems to have confused Abiathar 
  with Ahimelech (ii. 25; comp. I Sam. xxi. 1), if this is not merely a copyist's 
  blunder. It would appear from his interviews with the scribe (xii. 29-31; comp. 
  Luke x. 27) and with the rich young man (x. 19) that he was acquainted with 
  the Didache in its Jewish form, accepting its teachings as summing up the whole 
  of Jewish doctrine. Only a single incident of his early days is recorded: his 
  behavior about the time of his bar mi?wah (or confirmation) in the Temple (Luke 
  ii. 41-52). It is strange that so masterful a character showed no signs of its 
  exceptional qualities before the turning-point of Jesus' career.</p>
<p>Influence of John the Baptist.</p>
<p>The crisis in Jesus' life came with John the Baptist's preaching of repentance 
  and of the nearness of the kingdom of God. At first Jesus refused to submit 
  to baptism by John. According to a well-authenticated tradition of the &quot;Gospel 
  According to the Hebrews,&quot; he asked wherein he had sinned that it was necessary 
  for him to be baptized by John. Nevertheless the sight of the marked influence 
  exercised by the latter evidently made a profound impression on the character 
  of Jesus: he probably then experienced for the first time the power of a great 
  personality upon crowds of people.</p>
<p>It is at this moment of his life that Christian legend places what is known 
  as the temptation, information concerning which, from the very nature of the 
  case, could have been communicated only by Jesus himself. In the &quot;Gospel 
  According to the Hebrews&quot; account this is given in the form: &quot;My mother, 
  the Holy Spirit, took me just now by one of my hairs and carried me up to the 
  great Mount Tabor&quot; (which was in the neighborhood of his home). As Jerome 
  remarks (on Isa. xl. 9), the form of this saying implies a Hebrew (or rather 
  Aramaic) original (&quot;Ru?a ?addisha&quot;); and for this reason, among others, 
  the saying may be regarded as a genuine one. It is significant as implying two 
  things: (1) the belief of Jesus in a special divine origin of his spirit, and 
  (2) a tendency to ecstatic abstraction. This tendency is found in other great 
  leaders of men, like Socrates, Mohammed, and Napoleon, being accompanied in 
  their cases by hallucinations; auditory in the first case (the &quot;demon&quot; 
  of Socrates), and visual in the last two (Mohammed's dove and Napoleon's star). 
  These periods of ecstasy would tend to confirm in Oriental minds the impression 
  that the subject of them was inspired (comp. the original meaning of &quot;nabi&quot;; 
  see Prophet), and would add to the attractive force of a magnetic personality.</p>
<p>In Jesus' family and among his neighbors the effect seems to have been different. 
  His own people regarded him even as being out of his mind (iii. 21), and they 
  do not appear to have been associated with him or with the Christian movement 
  until after his death. Jesus himself seems to have been greatly incensed at 
  this (comp. vi. 4), refusing to recognize any special relationship even to his 
  mother (iii. 33; comp. John ii. 4), and declaring that spiritual relationship 
  exceeded a natural one (iii. 35). He felt perforce driven out into public activity; 
  and the feverish excitement of the succeeding epoch-making ten months implies 
  a tension of spirit which must have confirmed the impression of inspiration. 
  On the whole subject see O. Holtzman, &quot;War Jesus Ekstatiker?&quot; (Leipsic, 
  1902), who agrees that there must have been abnormal mental processes involved 
  in the utterances and behavior of Jesus.</p>
<p>His Belief in Demonology.</p>
<p>Instead, however, of remaining in the wilderness like John, or like the Essenes, 
  with whose tendencies his own show some affinity, he returned to his native 
  district and sought out those whom he wished to influence. Incidentally he developed 
  a remarkable power of healing; one sick of a fever (i. 29-34), a leper (i. 40-45), 
  a paralytic (ii. 1-12), and an epileptic (ix. 15-29) being severally cured by 
  him. But his activity in this regard was devoted especially to &quot;casting 
  out demons,&quot; i.e., according to the folkmedicine of the time, healing nervous 
  and mental diseases. It would appear that Jesus shared in the current belief 
  of the Jews in the noumenal existence of demons or evil spirits; and most of 
  his miraculous cures consisted in casting them out, which he did with &quot;the 
  finger of God&quot; (Luke xi. 20), or with &quot;the Spirit of God&quot; (Matt. 
  xii. 28). It would seem also that he regarded diseases like fever to be due 
  to the existence of demons (Luke iv. 39). One of the chief functions transmitted 
  to his disciples was the &quot;power over unclean spirits, to cast them out&quot; 
  (Matt. x. 1), and his superiority to his followers was shown by his casting 
  out demons which they had failed to expel (ix. 14-29). As regards the miracle 
  in which Jesus cast out a demon or several demons whose name was &quot;Legion&quot; 
  into some Gadarene swine (v. 1-21), it has recently been ingeniously suggested 
  by T. Reinach that the name &quot;Legion&quot; given to the spirits was due 
  to the popular confusion between the Tenth Legion (the sole Roman garrison of 
  Palestine between the years 70 and 135) and the wild boar which appeared as 
  the insignia on its standard (&quot;R. E. J.&quot; xlvii. 177). From this it 
  would seem that the legend arose, at any rate in its present form, after the 
  destruction of Jerusalem, at which time alone the confusion between the title 
  &quot;legion&quot; and the insignia could have occurred. For a full account 
  of the subject see F. C. Conybeare in &quot;J. Q. R.&quot; viii. 587-588, and 
  compare Demonology.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate what amount of truth exists in the accounts of 
  these cures, recorded about forty years after their occurrence; but doubtless 
  the mental excitement due to the influence of Jesus was often efficacious in 
  at least partial or temporary cures of mental illnesses. This would tend to 
  confirm the impression, both among those who witnessed the cures and among his 
  disciples, of his possession of supernatural powers. He himself occasionally 
  deprecated the exaggeration to which such cures naturally led. Thus in the case 
  of Jairus' daughter (v. 35-43) he expressly declared: &quot;She is not dead, 
  but sleepeth&quot; (39). Notwithstanding this, her resuscitation was regarded 
  as a miracle.</p>
<p>In essentials Jesus' teaching was that of John the Baptist, and it laid emphasis 
  on two points: (1) repentance, and (2) the near approach of the kingdom of God. 
  One other point is noted by Christian theologians as part of his essential teaching, 
  namely, insistence upon the fatherhood of God. This is such a commonplace in 
  the Jewish liturgy and in Jewish thought that it is scarcely necessary to point 
  out its essentially Jewish character (see Father). As regards repentance, its 
  specifically Jewish note has been recently emphasized by C. G. Montefiore (&quot;J. 
  Q. R.&quot; Jan., 1904), who points out that Christianity lays less stress upon 
  this side of religious life than Judaism; so that in this direction Jesus was 
  certainly more Jewish than Christian.</p>
<p>As regards the notion of the &quot;kingdom of heaven,&quot; the title itself 
  (&quot;malkut shamayim&quot;) is specifically Jewish; and the content of the 
  concept is equally so (see Kingdom of God). Jesus seems to have shared in the 
  belief of his contemporaries that some world-catastrophe was at hand in which 
  this kingdom would be reinstated on the ruins of a fallen world (ix. 1; comp. 
  xiii. 35-37 and Matt. x. 23).</p>
<p>Jewish Characteristics.</p>
<p>Almost at the beginning of his evangelical career Jesus differentiated himself 
  from John the Baptist in two directions: (1) comparative neglect of the Mosaic 
  or rabbinic law; and (2) personal attitude toward infractions of it. In many 
  ways his attitude was specifically Jewish, even in directions which are usually 
  regarded as signs of Judaic narrowness. Jesus appears to have preached regularly 
  in the synagogue, which would not have been possible if his doctrines had been 
  recognized as being essentially different from the current Pharisaic beliefs. 
  In his preaching he adopted the popular method of &quot;mashal,&quot; or Parable, 
  of which about thirty-one examples are instanced in the synoptic Gospels, forming 
  indeed the larger portion of his recorded teachings. It is obvious that such 
  a method is liable to misunderstanding; and it is difficult in all cases to 
  reconcile the various views that seem to underlie the parables. One of these 
  parables deserves special mention here, as it has obviously been changed, for 
  dogmatic reasons, so as to have an anti-Jewish application. There is little 
  doubt that J. Halevy is right (&quot;R. E. J.&quot; iv. 249-255) in suggesting 
  that in the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke x. 17-37) the original contrast 
  was between the priest, the Levite, and the ordinary Israelite&#151;representing 
  the three great classes into which Jews then and now were and are divided. The 
  point of the parable is against the sacerdotal class, whose members indeed brought 
  about the death of Jesus. Later, &quot;Israelite&quot; or &quot;Jew&quot; was 
  changed into &quot;Samaritan,&quot; which introduces an element of inconsistency, 
  since no Samaritan would have been found on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem 
  (ib. 30).</p>
<p>While the aim of Jesus was to redeem those who had strayed from the beaten 
  path of morality, he yet restricted his attention and that of his followers 
  to the lost sons of Israel (vii. 24). He particularly forbade his disciples 
  to seek heathens and Samaritans (x. 5), and for the same reason at first refused 
  to heal the Syrophenician woman (vii. 24). His choice of twelve apostles had 
  distinct reference to the tribes of Israel (iii. 13-16). He regarded dogs and 
  swine as unholy (Matt. vii. 6). His special prayer is merely a shortened form 
  of the third, fifth, sixth, ninth, and fifteenth of the Eighteen Benedictions 
  (see Lord's Prayer). Jesus wore the ?i?it (Matt. ix. 20); he went out of his 
  way to pay the Temple tax of two drachmas (ib. xvii. 24-27); and his disciples 
  offered sacrifice (ib. v. 23-24). In the Sermon on the Mount he expressly declared 
  that he had come not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it (ib. v. 17, quoted 
  in Shab. 116b), and that not a jot or tittle of the Law should ever pass away 
  (ib. v. 18; comp. Luke xvi. 17). It would even appear that later tradition regarded 
  him as scrupulous in keeping the whole Law (comp. John viii. 46).</p>
<p>Attitude Toward the Law.</p>
<p>Yet in several particulars Jesus declined to follow the directions of the Law, 
  at least as it was interpreted by the Rabbis. Where John's followers fasted, 
  he refused to do so (ii. 18). He permitted his followers to gather corn on the 
  Sabbath (ii. 23-28), and himself healed on that day (iii. 1-6), though the stricter 
  rabbis allowed only the saving of life to excuse the slightest curtailment of 
  the Sabbath rest (Shab. xxii. 6). In minor points, such as the ablution after 
  meals (vii. 2), he showed a freedom from traditional custom which implied a 
  break with the stricter rule of the more rigorous adherents of the Law at that 
  time. His attitude toward the Law is perhaps best expressed in an incident which, 
  though recorded in only one manuscript of the Gospel of Luke (vi. 4, in the 
  Codex Bez&aelig;), bears internal signs of genuineness. He is there reported 
  to have met a man laboring onthe Sabbath-day&#151;a sin deserving of death by 
  stoning, according to the Mosaic law. Jesus said to the man: &quot;Man, if thou 
  knowest what thou doest, blessed art thou; but if thou knowest not, accursed 
  art thou, and a transgressor of the Law.&quot; According to this, the Law should 
  be obeyed unless a higher principle intervenes.</p>
<p>While claiming not to infringe or curtail the Law, Jesus directed his followers 
  to pay more attention to the intention and motive with which any act was done 
  than to the deed itself. This was by no means a novelty in Jewish religious 
  development: the Prophets and Rabbis had continuously and consistently insisted 
  upon the inner motive with which pious deeds should be performed, as the well-known 
  passages in Isa. i. and Micah vi. sufficiently indicate. Jesus contended that 
  the application of this principle was practically equivalent to a revolution 
  in spiritual life; and he laid stress upon the contrast between the old Law 
  and the new one, especially in his Sermon on the Mount. In making these pretensions 
  he was following a tendency which at the period of his career was especially 
  marked in the Hasid&aelig;ans and Essenes, though they associated it with views 
  as to external purity and seclusion from the world, which differentiated them 
  from Jesus. He does not appear, however, to have contended that the new spirit 
  would involve any particular change in the application of the Law. He appears 
  to have suggested that marriages should be made permanent, and that divorce 
  should not be allowed (x. 2-12). In the Talmud it is even asserted that he threatened 
  to change the old law of primogeniture into one by which sons and daughters 
  should inherit alike (Shab. 116a); but there is no evidence for this utterance 
  in Christian sources. Apart from these points, no change in the Law was indicated 
  by Jesus; indeed, he insisted that the Jewish multitude whom he addressed should 
  do what the Scribes and Pharisees commanded, even though they should not act 
  as the Scribes acted (Matt. xxiii. 3). Jesus, however, does not appear to have 
  taken into account the fact that the Halakah was at this period just becoming 
  crystallized, and that much variation existed as to its definite form; the disputes 
  of the Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai were occurring about the time of his maturity.</p>
<p>It is, however, exaggerated to regard these variations from current practises 
  as exceptionally abnormal at the beginning of the first century. The existence 
  of a whole class of 'Am ha-Are?, whom Jesus may be taken to represent, shows 
  that the rigor of the Law had not yet spread throughout the people. It is stated 
  (iii. 7) that, owing to the opposition aroused by his action on the Sabbath, 
  Jesus was obliged to flee into heathen parts with some of his followers, including 
  two or three women who had attached themselves to his circle. This does not 
  seem at all probable, and is indeed contradicted by the Gospel accounts, which 
  describe him, even after his seeming break with the rigid requirements of the 
  traditional law, as lodging and feasting with the Pharisees (Luke xiv.), the 
  very class that would have objected to his behavior.</p>
<p>Tone of Authority.</p>
<p>Nothing in all this insistence upon the spirit of the Law rather than upon 
  the halakic development of it was necessarily or essentially anti-Jewish; but 
  the tone adopted in recommending these variations was altogether novel in Jewish 
  experience. The Prophets spoke with confidence in the truth of their message, 
  but expressly on the ground that they were declaring the word of the Lord. Jesus 
  adopted equal confidence; but he emphasized his own authority apart from any 
  vicarious or deputed power from on high. Yet in doing so he did not&#151;at 
  any rate publicly&#151;ever lay claim to any authority as attaching to his position 
  as Messiah. Indeed, the sole evidence in later times of any such claim seems 
  to be based upon the statement of Peter, and was intimately connected with the 
  personal demand of that apostle to be the head of the organization established 
  by or in the name of Jesus. It is expressly stated (Matt. xvi. 20) that the 
  disciples were admonished not to make public the claim, if it ever was made. 
  Peter's own pretensions to succession in the leadership appear to be based upon 
  a half-humorous paronomasia made by Jesus, which finds a parallel in rabbinic 
  literature (Matt. xvi. 18; comp. Yal?., Num. 766).</p>
<p>Indeed, the most striking characteristics of the utterances of Jesus, regarded 
  as a personality, were the tone of authority adopted by him and the claim that 
  spiritual peace and salvation were to be found in the mere acceptance of his 
  leadership. Passages like: &quot;Take my yoke upon you . . . and ye shall find 
  rest unto your souls&quot; (Matt. xi. 29); &quot;whosoever shall lose his life 
  for my sake . . . shall save it&quot; (viii. 35); &quot;Inasmuch as ye have 
  done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me&quot; 
  (Matt. xxv. 40), indicate an assumption of power which is certainly unique in 
  Jewish history, and indeed accounts for much of modern Jewish antipathy to Jesus, 
  so far as it exists. On the other hand, there is little in any of these utterances 
  to show that they were meant by the speaker to apply to anything more than personal 
  relations with him; and it might well be that in his experience he found that 
  spiritual relief was often afforded by simple human trust in his good-will and 
  power of direction.</p>
<p>This, however, raises the question whether Jesus regarded himself as in any 
  sense a Messiah or spiritual ruler; and there is singularly little evidence 
  in the synoptic Gospels to carry out this claim. These assert only that the 
  claim was made to some of the disciples, and then under a distinct pledge of 
  secrecy. In the public utterances of Jesus there is absolutely no trace of the 
  claim (except possibly in the use of the expression &quot;Son of Man&quot;). 
  Yet it would almost appear that in one sense of the word Jesus regarded himself 
  as fulfilling some of the prophecies which were taken among contemporary Jews 
  as applying to the Messiah. It is doubtful whether it was later tradition or 
  his own statements that identified him with the servant of Yhwh represented 
  in Isa. liii.; but there appears to be no evidence of any Jewish conception 
  of a Messiah suffering through and for his people, though there possibly was 
  a conception of one suffering together with his people (see Messiah). Jesus 
  himself never used the term &quot;Messiah.&quot; He chose for specific title 
  &quot;Son of Man,&quot; which may possibly have been connectedin his mind with 
  the reference in Dan. vii. 13, but which, according to modern theologians, means 
  simply man in general. In his own mind, too, this may have had some reference 
  to his repudiation by his family. In other words, Jesus regarded himself as 
  typically human, and claimed authority and regard in that aspect. He certainly 
  disclaimed any application to himself of the ordinary conception of the Messiah, 
  the Davidic descent of whom he argues against (xii. 35-57) entirely in the Talmudic 
  manner.</p>
<p>No New Organization, Contemplated.</p>
<p>It is difficult to decide the question whether Jesus contemplated a permanent 
  organization to carry out his ideals. The whole tendency of his work was against 
  the very idea of organization. His practical acceptance of the Law would seem 
  to imply an absence of any rival mode of life; and his evident belief in an 
  almost immediate reconstruction of the whole social and religious order would 
  tend to prevent any formal arrangements for a new religious organization. The 
  opposition between his followers and the &quot;world,&quot; or settled and organized 
  conditions of society, would also seem to imply that those who were to work 
  in his spirit could not make another &quot;world&quot; of their own with the 
  same tendency to conventionality and spiritual red tape. On the whole, it may 
  be said that he did not make general plans, but dealt with each spiritual problem 
  as it arose. &quot;It would almost seem as if he had no consciousness of a mission 
  of any definite sort, so content had he been to let things merely happen&quot; 
  (E. P. Gould, &quot;St. Mark,&quot; p. lxxv.): that is certainly how his career 
  strikes an outside observer. He was content to let the influence of his own 
  character work upon the persons immediately surrounding him, and that they should 
  transmit this influence silently and without organization; working by way of 
  leaven, as his parable puts it (Matt. xiii.). His chief work and that of his 
  disciples consisted in the conscious attempt at &quot;saving souls.&quot; Jesus 
  was justified in thinking that this new departure would tend to bring dissension 
  rather than peace into families, dividing sons and parents (ib. x. 53).</p>
<p>On the character which, whether designedly or otherwise, produced such momentous 
  influence on the world's history, it is unnecessary in this place to dilate. 
  The reverential admiration of the greater part of the civilized world has for 
  a millennium and a half been directed toward the very human and sympathetic 
  figure of the Galilean Jew as presented in the Gospels. For historic purposes, 
  however, it is important to note that this aspect of him was shown only to his 
  immediate circle. In almost all of his public utterances he was harsh, severe, 
  and distinctly unjust in his attitude toward the ruling and well-to-do classes. 
  After reading his diatribes against the Pharisees, the Scribes, and the rich, 
  it is scarcely to be wondered at that these were concerned in helping to silence 
  him. It must also be remembered that in his public utterances he rarely replied 
  directly to any important question of principle, but evaded queries by counter-queries. 
  In considering his public career, to which attention must now be turned, these 
  two qualities of his character have to be taken into account.</p>
<p>During the ten months which elapsed between the ripening of the corn about 
  June of the year 28 and his death in March or April of the following year Jesus 
  appears to have wandered about the north-west shore of Lake Gennesaret, making 
  excursions from time to time into the adjacent heathen territories, and devoting 
  himself and his disciples to the spread of John the Baptist's message of the 
  nearness of the kingdom of heaven and of the need of repentance in order to 
  enter it. The details of these wanderings are very obscure, and need not be 
  discussed here (see Briggs, &quot;New Light on the Life of Jesus,&quot; New 
  York, 1904).</p>
<p>The antinomianism of Jesus became more evident to the rulers of the people; 
  and many of the more religious classes avoided contact with him. He had from 
  the beginning laid stress upon the difficulty of associating sanctity with riches; 
  and in this he adopted the quasi-socialistic views of the later Psalms, Ps. 
  ix., x., xxii., xxv., xxxv., xl., lxix., cix. (comp. I. Loeb, &quot;La Litt&eacute;rature 
  des Pauvres dans la Bible,&quot; Paris, 1894). He insisted to the fullest extent 
  on the view implied in those Psalms and in various utterances of the Prophets, 
  that poverty and piety, riches and antisocial greed, were practically synonymous 
  (comp. the form of the beatitudes given in Luke vi. 20, 24-26). The parable 
  of Lazarus and Dives and the interview with the rich young man show a distinct 
  and one-sided tendency in this direction similar to that of the later Ebionites; 
  though, on the other hand, Jesus was willing to lodge with Zaech&aelig;us, a 
  rich publican (Luke xix. 2, 5). In the form of the interview with the rich young 
  man given in the &quot;Gospel According to the Hebrews,&quot; sympathy seems 
  to be restricted to the poor of the Holy Land: &quot;Behold, many of thy brethren, 
  sons of Abraham, are clothed but in dung, and die for hunger, while thy house 
  is full of many goods, and there goeth not forth aught from it unto them.&quot;</p>
<p>Jesus in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>As the Passover of the year 29 approached, Jesus determined to carry out the 
  injunction of the Law which made it incumbent to eat the sacrificial lamb at 
  Jerusalem. In the later tradition attempts were made to convey the impression 
  that Jesus was aware of the fate that awaited him at Jerusalem: but in the earliest 
  forms (ix. 32, x. 32) it is recognized that the disciples did not understand 
  the vague hints, if they were at all given; and there is little to show that 
  his visit to Jerusalem was a case of sublime suicide. At the last moment at 
  Gethsemane he made an attempt to avoid arrest (&quot;Rise up, let us go,&quot; 
  xiv. 42). Jerusalem at this time appears to have been in a very unsettled state. 
  An attempted revolution seems to have broken out under one Jesus bar Abbas, 
  who had been captured and was in prison at the time (xv. 7). It appears to have 
  been the practise of Pontius Pilate to come up to Jerusalem each year at Passover 
  for the purpose of checking any revolt that might break out at that period recalling 
  the redemption of Israel. It is indicative of the temper of the people that 
  during the first half of the first century several risings occurred against 
  the Romans: against Varus, 4 B.C.; under Judas against the Census, 6 C.E.; by 
  the Samaritans against Pilate in 38; and by Theudas against Fadusin 45&#151;all 
  indicating the continuously unsettled condition of the people under Roman rule.</p>
<p>In the Temple.</p>
<p>As far as can be judged, his reception was as much a surprise to Jesus as it 
  was to his followers and to the leaders of the people. His reputation as a miracle-worker 
  had preceded him; and when the little cavalcade of some twenty persons which 
  formed his escort approached the Fountain Gate of Jerusalem he was greeted by 
  many of the visitors to the city as if he were the long-hoped-for deliverer 
  from bondage. This would appear to have been on the first day of the week and 
  on the 10th of Nisan, when, according to the Law, it was necessary that the 
  paschal lamb should be purchased. It is therefore probable that the entry into 
  Jerusalem was for this purpose. In making the purchase of the lamb a dispute 
  appears to have arisen between Jesus' followers and the money-changers who arranged 
  for such purchases; and the latter were, at any rate for that day, driven from 
  the Temple precincts. It would appear from Talmudic references that this action 
  had no lasting effect, if any, for Simon ben Gamaliel found much the same state 
  of affairs much later (Ker. i. 7) and effected some reforms (see Derenbourg 
  in &quot;Histoire de la Palestine,&quot; p. 527). The act drew public attention 
  to Jesus, who during the next few days was asked to define his position toward 
  the conflicting parties in Jerusalem. It seemed especially to attack the emoluments 
  of the priestly class, which accordingly asked him to declare by what authority 
  he had interfered with the sacrosanct arrangements of the Temple. In a somewhat 
  enigmatic reply he placed his own claims on a level with those of John the Baptist&#151;in 
  other words, he based them on popular support. Other searching questions put 
  to him by the Sadducces and the Scribes received somewhat more definite answers. 
  On the former asking what evidence for immortality he derived from the Old Testament, 
  he quoted Ex. iii. 6, and deduced from it that as God is God of the living, 
  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob must have been living after their death&#151;a deduction 
  quite in the spirit of Talmudic Asmakta (comp. Sanh. 90b).</p>
<p>The Test of the Tribute.</p>
<p>To a scribe asking him (in the spirit of Hillel) to what single commandment 
  the whole Law could be reduced, he quoted the doctrine of the Didache, which 
  gives the two chief commandments as the Shema' (Deut. vi. 4) and &quot;Thou 
  shalt love thy neighbor as thyself&quot; (Lev. xviii. 19), thus declaring the 
  essential solidarity of his own views with those of the Old Testament and of 
  current Judaism, But the most crucial test was put to him by certain of the 
  adherents of Herod, who asked him whether it was lawful to pay tribute to C&aelig;sar. 
  Here again he scarcely answered directly, but, asking for a denarius of tribute, 
  deduced from the image and superscription thereon the conclusion that it ought 
  to be returned unto C&aelig;sar (Matt. xxii. 21). A very probable tradition, 
  retained in Tatian's &quot;Diatessaron,&quot; declares that the colloquy with 
  Peter recorded in Matt. xvii. 24-26 occurred on this occasion. Neither the original 
  answer nor his further defense of it was satisfactory to the Zealots, who were 
  anxious for an uprising against the Romans. He had made it clear that he had 
  no sympathy with the nationalistic aspirations of the common people, though 
  they had welcomed him under the impression that he was about to realize their 
  hopes. It is only this incident which accounts historically for the contrast 
  between the acclamations of Palm Sunday and the repudiation on the succeeding 
  Friday.</p>
<p>This change of popular sentiment cleared the way for action by the priestly 
  class, which had been offended in both pride and pocket by Jesus' action in 
  clearing the purlieus of the Temple. They may have also genuinely feared a rising 
  under Jesus, having in view the manner in which he had been welcomed on the 
  previous Sunday, though this was possibly brought forward merely as a pretext. 
  It would appear that they determined to seize him before the Feast of the Passover, 
  when the danger of an outbreak would be at its greatest height and when it would 
  be impossible for them to hold a court (Yom-?ob v. 2).</p>
<p>The Last Supper.</p>
<p>According to the synoptic Gospels, it would appear that on the Thursday evening 
  of the last week of his life Jesus with his disciples entered Jerusalem in order 
  to eat the Passover meal with them in the sacred city; if so, the wafer and 
  the wine of the mass or the communion service then instituted by him as a memorial 
  would be the unleavened bread and the unfermented wine of the Seder service 
  (see Bickell, &quot;Messe und Pascha,&quot; Leipsic, 1872). On the other hand, 
  the Gospel of John, the author of which appears to have had access to some trustworthy 
  traditions about the last days, represents the priests as hurrying on the trial 
  in order to avoid taking action on the festival&#151;which would, according 
  to this, have begun on Friday evening&#151;though this view may have been influenced 
  by the desire to make the death of Jesus symbolize the sacrifice of the paschal 
  lamb. Chwolson (&quot;Das Letzte Passahmal Christi,&quot; St. Petersburg, 1893) 
  has ingeniously suggested that the priests were guided by the older Halakah, 
  according to which the law of the Passover was regarded as superior to that 
  of the Sabbath, so that the lamb could be sacrificed even on Friday night; whereas 
  Jesus and his disciples would seem to have adopted the more rigorous view of 
  the Pharisees by which the paschal lamb ought to be sacrificed on the eve of 
  the 14th of Nisan when the 15th coincided with the Sabbath (see Bacher in &quot;J. 
  Q. R.&quot; v. 683-686).</p>
<p>It would seem that by this time Jesus had become aware of the intention of 
  the high priests to do him harm; for after the Seder ceremony he secreted himself 
  in the Garden of Gethsemane outside the city walls, where, however, his hiding-place 
  was betrayed by one of his immediate followers, Judas, a man of Kerioth (see 
  Judas Iscariot). On what grounds Jesus was arrested is not quite clear. Even 
  if he had claimed to be the Messiah, he would have committed no crime according 
  to Jewish law. It appears that he was taken first to the house of the high priest, 
  probably Anan's, which was without the walls, and where in a hurried consultation 
  the only evidence against him was apparently an assertion that he could overthrow 
  the Temple and replace it with one made without hands&#151;in other words, with 
  aspiritual kingdom. This, according to Holtzmann (&quot;Leben Jesu,&quot; p. 
  327), was equivalent to a claim to the Messiahship. Jesus is reported to have 
  distinctly made this claim in answer to a direct question by the high priest; 
  but the synoptic Gospels vary on this point, xiv. 62 making the claim, and Matt. 
  xxvi. 64 and Luke xxii. 69 representing an evasion, which was more in accord 
  with the usual practise of Jesus when questioned by opponents. The rending of 
  his clothes by the high priest seems rather to imply that the charge was one 
  of &quot;gidduf&quot; or blasphemy (Sanh. vii. 10, 11).</p>
<p>There could be no question of anything corresponding to a trial taking place 
  on this occasion before the Sanhedrin. Whatever inquest was made must have occurred 
  during the Thursday night and outside Jerusalem (for on entering the city a 
  prisoner would have had to be given up to the Roman garrison), and can not have 
  been held before a quorum of the seventy-one members of the Sanhedrin. It is 
  more probable that the twenty-three members of the priestly section of the latter, 
  who had most reason to be offended with Jesus' action in cleansing the Temple, 
  met informally after he had been seized, and elicited sufficient to justify 
  them in their own opinion in delivering him over to the Romans as likely to 
  cause trouble by his claims or pretensions to the Messiahship, which, of course, 
  would be regarded by them as rebellion against Rome. Nothing corresponding to 
  a Jewish trial took place, though it was by the action of the priests that Jesus 
  was sent before Pontius Pilate (see Crucifixion). The Gospels speak in the plural 
  of the high priests who condemned him&#151;a seeming contradiction to Jewish 
  law which might throw doubt upon their historic character. Two, however, are 
  mentioned, Joseph Caiaphas and Annas (Hanan), his father-in-law. Hanan had been 
  deposed from the high-priesthood by Valerius Gratus, but he clearly retained 
  authority and some prerogatives of the high priest, as most of those who succeeded 
  him were relatives of his; and he may well have intervened in a matter touching 
  so nearly the power of the priests. According to the Talmud, Hanan's bazaars 
  were on the Mount of Olives, and probably therefore also his house; this would 
  thus have become the appropriate place for the trial by the Sanhedrin, which 
  indeed just about this time had moved its place of session thither (see Sanhedrin).</p>
<p>The Crucifixion.</p>
<p>In handing over their prisoner to the procurator, Pontius Pilate, the Jewish 
  officials refused to enter the pretorium as being ground forbidden to Jews. 
  They thereby at any rate showed their confidence in the condemnation of Jesus 
  by the Roman power. Before Pilate the sole charge could be attempted rebellion 
  against the emperor. In some way, it would appear, the claim to be king of the 
  Jews (or possibly of a kingdom of heaven) was made before him by Jesus himself, 
  as is shown by the inscription nailed up in derision on the cross. To Pilate 
  the problem presented was somewhat similar to that which would present itself 
  to an Indian official of to-day before whom a Mohammedan should be accused of 
  claiming to be the Mahdi. If overt acts in a disturbed district had accompanied 
  the claim, the official could scarcely avoid passing sentence of condemnation; 
  and Pilate took the same course. But he seems to have hesitated: while condemning 
  Jesus, he gave him a chance of life. It appears to have been the practise to 
  grant to the Jewish populace the privilege of pardoning a prisoner on public 
  holidays; and Pontius Pilate held out to the rabble surrounding the pretorium 
  (for most responsible heads of families must have been at this time engaged 
  in searching for leaven in their own homes) a choice between Jesus and the other 
  Jesus (bar Abbas), who also had been accused of rebellion. The mob had naturally 
  more sympathy for the avowed rebel than for the person who had recommended the 
  payment of tribute. It chose Barabbas; and Jesus was left to undergo the Roman 
  punishment of Crucifixion in company with two malefactors. He refused with some 
  not overkindly words (Luke xxiii. 28-31) the deadening drink of frankincense, 
  myrrh, and vinegar which the ladies of Jerusalem were accustomed to offer to 
  condemned criminals in order that they might pass away in an unconscious state 
  (Sanh. 43a). Whatever had been Jesus' anticipations, he bore the terrible tortures, 
  due to the strain and cramping of the internal organs, with equanimity till 
  almost the last, when he uttered the despairing and pathetic cry &quot;Eloi, 
  Eloi, lama sabachthani?&quot; (the Aramaic form of Ps. xxii. 1, &quot;My God, 
  my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot;), which showed that even his resolute 
  spirit had been daunted by the ordeal. This last utterance was in all its implications 
  itself a disproof of the exaggerated claims made for him after his death by 
  his disciples. The very form of his punishment would disprove those claims in 
  Jewish eyes. No Messiah that Jews could recognize could suffer such a death; 
  for &quot;He that is hanged is accursed of God&quot; (Deut. xxi. 23), &quot;an 
  insult to God&quot; (Targum, Rashi). How far in his own mind Jesus substituted 
  another conception of the Messiah, and how far he regarded himself as fulfilling 
  that ideal, still remain among the most obscure of historical problems (see 
  Messiah).</p>

<p>&#151;In Theology: </p>
<p>Because the Gospels, while containing valuable material, are all written in 
  a polemical spirit and for the purpose of substantiating the claim of the Messianic 
  and superhuman character of Jesus, it is difficult to present an impartial story 
  of his life. Nor is the composite picture ofJesus drawn from the synoptic Gospels, 
  such as is presented by modern Christian writers and in which the miraculous 
  is reduced to the minimum, an approximation to the real Jesus. The Jesus of 
  history was equally as remote from Paulinian antinomianism as from the antagonism 
  to his own kinsmen which has been ascribed to him; the Pharisees having had 
  no cause to hate and persecute him, nor had they given any cause for being hated 
  by him even if their views differed from his (see New Testament).</p>
<p>It was not as the teacher of new religious principles nor as a new lawgiver, 
  but as a wonder-worker, that Jesus won fame and influence among the simple inhabitants 
  of Galilee in his lifetime; and it was due only to his frequent apparitions 
  after his death to these Galilean followers that the belief in his resurrection 
  and in his Messianic and divine character was accepted and spread. The thaumaturgic 
  and eschatological views of the times must be fully considered, and the legendary 
  lives of saints such as Onias, ?anina ben Dosa, Phinehas ben Jair, and Simeon 
  ben Yo?ai in the Talmud, as well as the apocalyptic and other writings of the 
  Essenes, must be compared before a true estimate of Jesus can be formed.</p>
<p>However, a great historic movement of the character and importance of Christianity 
  can not have arisen without a great personality to call it into existence and 
  to give it shape and direction. Jesus of Nazareth had a mission from God (see 
  Maimonides, &quot;Yad,&quot; Melakim, xi. 4, and the other passages quoted in 
  Jew. Encyc. iv. 56 et seq., s.v. Christianity); and he must have had the spiritual 
  power and fitness to be chosen for it. The very legends surrounding his life 
  and his death furnish proofs of the greatness of his character, and of the depth 
  of the impression which it left upon the people among whom he moved.</p>
<p>Legends Concerning His Birth.</p>
<p>Some legends, however, are artificial rather than the natural product of popular 
  fancy. To this category belong those concerning Jesus' birthplace. The fact 
  that Nazareth was his native town&#151;where as the oldest son he followed his 
  father's trade of carpenter (Mark i. 9, vi. 3; comp. Matt. xiii. 55; John vii. 
  41)&#151;seemed to be in conflict with the claim to the Messiahship, which, 
  according to Micah v. 1 (A. V. 2) (comp. John vii. 42; Yer. Ber. ii. 5a; Lam. 
  R. i. 15), called for Beth-lehem of Judah as the place of his origin; hence, 
  the two different legends, one in Luke i. 26, ii. 4, and the other in Matt. 
  ii. 1-22, where the parallel to Moses (comp. Ex. iv. 19) is characteristic. 
  In support of the Messianic claim, also, the two different genealogies were 
  compiled: the one, in Matt. i. 1-16, tracing Joseph's pedigree through forty-two 
  generations back to Abraham, with a singular emphasis upon sinners and heathen 
  ancestresses of the house of David (comp. Gen. R. xxiii., li., lxxxv.; Ruth 
  R. iv. 7; Naz. 23b; Hor. 10b; Meg. 14b); the other, in Luke iii. 23-38, tracing 
  it back to Adam as &quot;the son of God&quot; in order to include also the non-Abrahamic 
  world. Incompatible with these genealogies, and of pagan origin (see Boeklen, 
  &quot;Die Verwandtschaft der J&uuml;disch-Christlichen mit der Parsichen Eschatologie,&quot; 
  1902, pp. 91-94; Holtzmann, &quot;Hand-Commentar zum Neuen Testament,&quot; 
  1889, p. 32; Soltau, in &quot;Vierteljahrschrift f&uuml;r Bibelkunde,&quot; 
  1903, pp. 36-40), is the story representing Jesus as the son of the Virgin Mary 
  and of the Holy Ghost (taken as masculine, Matt. i. 20-23; Luke i. 27-35). So 
  also the story of the angels and shepherds hailing the babe in the manger (Luke 
  ii. 8-20) betrays the influence of the Mithra legend (Cumont, &quot;Die Mysterien 
  des Mithra,&quot; 1903, pp. 97, 147; &quot;Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Neutestamentliche 
  Wissenschaft,&quot; 1902, p. 190), whereas the legend concerning the prophecy 
  of the two Essene saints, Simeon and Anna, and the bar mi?wah story (Luke ii. 
  22-39, 40-50) have a decidedly Jewish character.</p>
<p>From the &quot;Gospel According to the Hebrews&quot; (Jerome, commentary on 
  Matt. iii. 13, 16), it seems that Jesus was induced by his mother and brothers 
  to go to John to be baptized in order to obtain the forgiveness of his sins; 
  his vision, too, is there described differently (comp. Justin, &quot;Dial. cum 
  Tryph.&quot; lxxxviii., ciii.; Usener, &quot;Religionsgeschichtliche Untersuchungen,&quot; 
  1889, pp. 1, 47; and Holy Spirit). Genuinely Jewish also is the legend which 
  depicts Jesus as spending forty days with God among the holy &quot;?ayyot&quot; 
  (not &quot;wild beasts,&quot; as rendered in Mark i. 13) without eating and 
  drinking (comp. Ex. xxxiv. 28; Deut. ix. 9); and his encounter with Satan is 
  similar to the one which Moses had in heaven (Pesi?. R. xx., based upon Ps. 
  lxviii. 19; comp. Zoroaster's encounter with Ahriman [Zend Avesta, Vend., Fargard, 
  xix. 1-9]) and to Buddha's with Mara (K&ouml;ppen, &quot;Die Religion des Buddha,&quot; 
  1857, i. 88, and R. Seydel, &quot;Das Evangelium von Jesu,&quot; 1882, p. 156).</p>
<p>As Healer and Wonder-Worker.</p>
<p>When, after John's imprisonment, Jesus took up the work of his master, preaching 
  repentance in view of the approach of the kingdom of God (Mark i. 14; Luke i. 
  79; comp. Matt. iii. 2, iv. 16-17), he chose as his field of operations the 
  land around the beautiful lake of Gennesaret, with Capernaum as center, rather 
  than the wilderness; and he had as followers Peter, Andrew, John, and others, 
  his former companions (John i. 35-51; comp. Matt. iv. 18; Mark i. 16 with Luke 
  v. 1). His chief activity consisted in healing those possessed with unclean 
  spirits who gathered at the synagogues at the close of the Sabbath (Mark i. 
  32-34; Luke iv. 40). Wherever he came in his wanderings through Galilee and 
  Syria the people followed him (Matt. iv. 23-24; xii. 15; xiv. 14, 34; xv. 30; 
  xix. 1; Mark iii. 10; Luke vi. 17-19), bringing to him the sick, the demoniacs, 
  epileptics, lunatics, and paralytics to be cured; and he drove out the unclean 
  spirits, &quot;rebuking&quot; them (Matt. xvii. 18; Luke iv. 35, 39, 41; ix. 
  42; comp. &quot;ga'ar&quot; in Zech. iii. 2; Isa. 1. 2; Ps. lxviii. 31 [A. V. 
  30]) with some magic &quot;word&quot; (Matt. viii. 8, 16; comp. &quot;milla,&quot; 
  Shab. 81b; Eccl. R. i. 8), even as he &quot;rebuked&quot; the wind and told 
  the sea to stand still (Mark iv. 35 and parallels). At times he cured the sufferers 
  by the mere touch of his hand (Mark i. 25; Matt. viii. 8, ix. 18-25), or by 
  powers emanating from him through the fringes of his garment (ib. ix. 20, xiv. 
  36), orby the use of spittle put upon the affected organ, accompanying the operation 
  with a whisper (Mark vii. 32, viii. 23; John ix. 1-11; comp. Sanh. 101a; Yer. 
  Shab. xiv. 14d: Lo?esh and Ro?). By the same exorcismal power he drove a whole 
  legion of evil spirits, 2,000 in number, out of a maniac living in a cemetery 
  (Josephus, &quot;B. J.&quot; vii. 6, &sect; 3; Sanh. 65b) and made them enter 
  a herd of swine to be drowned in the adjacent lake (Luke viii. 26-39 and parallels; 
  comp. Ta'an. 21b; ?id. 49b; B. ?. vii. 7). It was exactly this Essenic practise 
  which gained for him the name of prophet (Matt. xxi. 11, 46; Luke vii. 16, 39; 
  xxiv. 19; John iv. 19). In fact, by these supernatural powers of his he himself 
  believed that Satan and his hosts would be subdued and the kingdom of God would 
  be brought about (Luke ix. 2, x. 18, xi. 20); and these powers he is said to 
  have imparted to his disciples to be exercised only in connection with the preaching 
  of the kingdom of God (Matt. ix. 35-x. 6; Mark vi. 7; Luke ix. 1-2). They are 
  to him the chief proof of his Messiahship (Matt. xi. 2-19; Luke vii. 21-22). 
  It was as the healer of physical pain that Jesus regarded himself &quot;sent 
  to the lost sheep of the house of Israel&quot;; and in the same spirit he sent 
  forth his disciples to perform cures everywhere, yet always excluding the heathen 
  from such benefits (Matt. x. 6-8, xv. 22-28). Other miracles ascribed to Jesus, 
  such as the feeding of the 5,000 and the 4,000 (Mark vi. 30-46, viii. 1-9, and 
  parallels), have probably been suggested by the miracles of Moses, and the raising 
  of the dead (Luke vii. 11-17, viii. 40-56; John xi. 1-46) by those of Elijah.</p>
<p>As Helper of the Poor and Forsaken.</p>
<p>While the Essenes in general were not only healers and wonder-workers but also 
  doers of works of charity, there was aroused in Jesus, owing to his constant 
  contact with suffering humanity, a deep compassion for the ailing and the forsaken 
  (Matt. xiv. 14, xv. 32). With this there came to him the consciousness of his 
  mission to bring good tidings to the poor (Luke iv. 16-30, vii. 22) and to break 
  down the barrier which Pharisaism had erected between the Pharisees as the better 
  class of society and the 'Am ha-Are?, the publicans and fallen ones (Matt. ix. 
  10-13, xi. 19, and parallels; Luke vii. 36-50). This was a great departure from 
  Essenism, which, in order to attain a higher degree of pharisaic sanctity, kept 
  its adherents entirely apart from the world, in order that they might not be 
  contaminated by it. Jesus, on the contrary, sought the society of sinners and 
  fallen ones, saying, &quot;They that are whole need not a physician, but they 
  that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance&quot; 
  (Luke v. 31-32; comp. parallels). No wonder that, when performing his miracles, 
  he was believed to be in league with Satan or Beelzebub, the spirit of uncleanness, 
  rather than to be filled with the Holy Spirit (Mark iii. 22 and parallels). 
  This anti-Essenic principle, once announced, emboldened him to allow the very 
  women he had cured to accompany him and his disciples&#151;in sharp contrast 
  to all tradition (Luke viii. 1-3); and they repaid his regard with profound 
  adoration, and subsequently were prominent at the grave and in the resurrection 
  legend.</p>
<p>Another departure from pharisaic as well as Essenic practise was his permission 
  to his disciples to eat with unwashed hands. When rebuked he declared: &quot;Whatsoever 
  from without entereth into the man can not defile him, but that which proceedeth 
  out of the man [evil speech], that defileth the man&quot; (Mark vii. 15 and 
  parallels)&#151;a principle which scarcely implied the Paulinian abrogation 
  of the dietary laws, but was probably intended to convey the idea that &quot;the 
  profane can not defile the word of God&quot; (Ber. 22a).</p>
<p>In another direction, also, Jesus in his practises as a physician was led to 
  oppose the rigorists of his day. The old Hasid&aelig;an Sabbath laws were extremely 
  severe, as may be seen from the last chapter of the Book of Jubilees; to these 
  the Shammaites adhered, prohibiting healing on Sabbath. But there were also 
  the Hillelites, who accepted liberal maxims, such as &quot;Where a life is at 
  stake the Sabbath law must give way&quot; and &quot;The Sabbath is handed over 
  to you, not you to the Sabbath&quot; (Mek., Ki Tissa). Jesus, following these 
  latter, performed cures on the Sabbath (Mark ii. 27, iii. 1-16, and parallels; 
  Luke xiii. 10-21, xiv. 1-8); but that the Pharisees should on this account have 
  planned his destruction, as the Gospels record, is absurd. In fact, the compilers 
  misunderstood the phrase &quot;The son of man is lord of the Sabbath&quot;&#151;as 
  if this abrogation of the Sabbath were the privilege of the Messiah&#151;as 
  well as the story of the plucking of grain by the disciples, which Luke (vi. 
  1) alone has preserved more correctly. It was not on the Sabbath, but on the 
  first day of the second Passover week (called dete??p??t? from the Biblical 
  expression &quot;the morrow of the Sabbath,&quot; Lev. xxiii. 11-14), when no 
  new corn was allowed to be eaten before some had been offered on the altar, 
  that the disciples of Jesus passed through the field and plucked the new corn, 
  called &quot;?adash&quot; in rabbinical literature. In defending their action 
  Jesus correctly referred to David, who ate of the holy bread because he was 
  hungry (I Sam. xxi. 5-7)&#151;an argument which would not at all apply to the 
  Sabbath.</p>
<p>Man of the People; Not a Reformer.</p>
<p>Jesus spoke with the power of the Haggadists&#151;compare, e.g., &quot;the 
  men of little faith&quot; (So?ah 48b); &quot;the eye that lusts, the hand that 
  sins must be cut off&quot; (Nid. 13b); &quot;no divorce except for fornication&quot; 
  (Gi?. 90b); &quot;purity like that of a child&quot; (Yoma 22a)&#151;and not 
  like the men of the Halakah (Luke iv. 32; comp. Matt. vii. 29, &quot;not like 
  the scribes&quot;). He often opposed the legalism of the Halakists (Matt. xxiii. 
  9; Mark vii. 6-23), but he affirmed in forcible and unmistakable language the 
  immutability of the Law (Matt. v. 17-19). The Sermon on the Mount, if this was 
  ever delivered by him, was never intended to supplant the law of Moses, though 
  the compiler of the Gospel of Matthew seeks to create that impression. Nor does 
  any of the apostles or of the epistles refer to the new code promulgated by 
  Jesus. As a matter of fact the entire New Testament teaching is based upon the 
  Jewish Didache (see Seeberg, &quot;Katechismus der Urchristenheit,&quot; 1903, 
  pp. 1-44).</p>
<p>The Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Only in order to be prepared for the kingdom of God, which he expected to come 
  in the immediatefuture and during the lifetime of his hearers (Matt. xvi. 28, 
  xxiv. 42-44, xxv. 13), Jesus laid down especial rules of conduct for his disciples, 
  demanding of them a higher righteousness and purity and a greater mutual love 
  than the Pharisees practised (Matt. v. 20, xviii. 4-5). It was the Essenic spirit 
  which dictated a life of voluntary poverty, of abstinence from marriage and 
  domestic life, and of asceticism (Matt. xix. 12, 21-24, 29), as well as that 
  principle of non-resistance to evil which the Talmud finds commendable in &quot;the 
  lovers of God&quot; who &quot;take insult and resent not&quot; and shall in 
  the life to come &quot;shine like the sun&quot; (Shab. 88b). The kingdom of 
  God of which Jesus spoke had a decidedly political character, and all the apocalyptic 
  writers so regard it. The Messiah with the twelve judges of the twelve tribes 
  was expected to rule over the land (Matt. xvi. 27, xix. 28); the Judgment Day 
  was to have its tortures of Gehenna for the wicked, and its banquet in Paradise 
  for the righteous, to precede the Messianic time (Matt. viii. 11-12, xviii. 
  8-9; Luke xiii. 28-29, xiv. 15-24); the earth itself was to produce plenty of 
  grapes and other fruit of marvelous size for the benefit of the righteous, according 
  to Jesus' own statement to John (Papias, in Iren&aelig;us, &quot;Adversus H&aelig;reses,&quot; 
  v. 33-34).</p>
<p>Often Jesus spoke of the &quot;secrets&quot; of the kingdom of God in allegories 
  and enigmas (not &quot;parables&quot;; see Matt. xiii. 1-52; comp. ii. 35), 
  &quot;dark sayings hidden from the foundation of the world (Ps. lxxviii. 2; 
  John xvi. 25, 29), because they referred to the kingdom of Satan (Matt. xiii. 
  39)&#151;that is, Rome&#151;whose end was nigh. Of course such &quot;secrets&quot; 
  were afterward turned into spiritual mysteries, too deep even for the disciples 
  to comprehend, while simple words announcing the immediate nearness of the end 
  were changed into phrases such as &quot;The kingdom of God is within you&quot; 
  (Luke xvii. 21, for &quot;among you&quot;). On the other hand, the rabbinical 
  phrase &quot;the yoke of God's kingdom which liberates from the yoke of the 
  kingdom of the worldly power&quot; (Ab. iii. 5) is spoken of as &quot;my yoke&quot; 
  and declared to be &quot;easy&quot; (Matt. xi. 29); for the allegory of the 
  tares and the wheat (Matt. xiii.) used for the heathen and the Jews in the Judgment 
  Day, comp. Midr. Teh. to Ps. ii. 12. Occasionally political strife, as a means 
  of bringing about the catastrophe, is approved by Jesus (Luke xii. 51-53, xxii. 
  36; comp. verses 49-50).</p>
<p>His Death.</p>
<p>Like all the Essenes of his time (Tosef., Men. xiii. 21-23), Jesus was a sworn 
  enemy of the house of the high priest Hanan. His indignation at seeing the Temple 
  hill turned into a poultry-and cattle-market for the benefit of the arrogant 
  hierarchy (Mark xi. 15-18) fired him into action against these &quot;bazaars 
  of the Hananites&quot; (Derenbourg, &quot;Histoire de la Palestine,&quot; p. 
  466), which he called with Jeremiah (vii. 1) &quot;a den of thieves&quot;; he 
  seized the tables of the money-changers and drove their owners out of the Temple. 
  Whether he had then actually claimed for himself the title of Messiah in order 
  to be empowered to act thus, or whether he allowed the band of his followers 
  to call him thus, it is certain that he laid no claim to the Messiahship before 
  his entrance into Jerusalem (see Jew. Encyc. iv. 51, s.v. Christianity; Son 
  of Man). According to the more authentic older records (Mark viii. 31, x. 33, 
  xi. 18, xiv. 43, and parallels), he was seized by the high priests and the Sanhedrin, 
  and was delivered over to the Roman authorities for execution. The high priests 
  feared the Roman prefect (John xviii. 14); but the people clung to Jesus (Matt. 
  xxvi. 5; Luke xix. 48, xxi. 38, xxiii. 27), and lamented over his death (Luke 
  xxiii. 48). Later &quot;the Pharisees&quot; were added to the list of the persecutors 
  of Jesus (Matt. xxii. 15; Mark xii. 13; John xviii. 3; and elsewhere), and the 
  guilt of shedding his blood was laid upon the Jews, while the bloodthirsty tyrant 
  Pontius Pilate was represented as having asserted Jesus' innocence (Matt. xxvii. 
  24; John xviii. 28-xix. 16). The term &quot;heathen&quot; or &quot;Romans&quot; 
  was changed into &quot;sinners&quot; or &quot;men&quot; (Mark ix. 31, xiv. 41, 
  and parallels), and the charge of rebellion against Rome with the implied instigation 
  to refuse the tribute (Luke xxiii. 2) was put into the mouth of the Jewish authorities, 
  whereas Jesus is represented as having declared: &quot;My kingdom is not of 
  this world&quot; (John xviii. 36) and &quot;Render to C&aelig;sar the things 
  that are C&aelig;sar's&quot; (Mark xii. 13-17 and parallels).</p>
<p>The Resurrection.</p>
<p>The story of the resurrection of Jesus is the natural consequence of the belief 
  of his followers in his miraculous powers as the subduer of Satan. Indeed, it 
  is stated that it was not he alone who arose from the grave, but that many saints 
  arose with him (Matt. xxvii. 52) just as many saints in Jewish folk-lore overcame 
  death (Shab. 55b; Mas. Derek Ere?, i.); and resurrection is the proof of the 
  working of the Holy Spirit (So?ah xv. 15; Cant. R., Introduction, 9; see Resurrection). 
  The disciples and the women who had been his constant companions when he was 
  alive beheld him in their entranced state as partaking of their meals and heard 
  him address to them instruction and argumentation (Matt. xxviii. 9, 18-20; Luke 
  xxiv. 27-49; John xx. 15-xxi. 23). Many apparitions of Jesus after his death 
  were in the course of time related as having taken place during his lifetime. 
  Thus the strange stories of his walking at night as a spirit upon a lake (Matt. 
  xiv. 24-36; Luke ix. 28-36; and parallels), of his transfiguration and conversation 
  with Moses and Elijah (Matt. xvii. 1-13), and others became current in those 
  credulous times when all the Apostles had their visions and direct communications 
  from their master, whom they beheld as &quot;the Son of Man in the clouds&quot; 
  waiting for &quot;his return with myriads of angels&quot; to take possession 
  of this earth. And so it came about that, consciously or unconsciously, the 
  crystallized thought of generations of Essenes and entire chapters taken from 
  their apocalyptic literature (Matt. xxiv.-xxv.) were put into the mouth of Jesus, 
  the acme and the highest type of Essenism.</p>
<p>It was not the living but the departed Jesus that created the Church with Peter 
  as the rock (Matt. xvi, 18); while, according to the Jewish Haggadah, Abraham 
  was made the rock upon which God built His kingdom (Yal?., Num. 766). See Lord's 
  Prayer; Lord's Supper.<br>

<p>&#151;In Jewish Legend: </p>
<p>The Jewish legends in regard to Jesus are found in three sources, each independent 
  of the others&#151;(1) in New Testament apocrypha and Christian polemical works, 
  (2) in the Talmud and the Midrash, and (3) in the life of Jesus (&quot;Toledot 
  Yeshu'&quot;) that originated in the Middle Ages. It is the tendency of all 
  these sources to be-little the person of Jesus by ascribing to him illegitimate 
  birth, magic, and a shameful death. In view of their general character they 
  are called indiscriminately legends. Some of the statements, as that referring 
  to magic, are found among pagan writers and Christian heretics; and as the Ebionites, 
  or Jud&aelig;o-Christians, who for a long time lived together with the Jews, 
  are also classed as heretics, conclusions may be drawn from this as to the origin 
  of these legends.</p>
<p>It ought also to be added that many of the legends have a theological background. 
  For polemical purposes, it was necessary for the Jews to insist on the illegitimacy 
  of Jesus as against the Davidic descent claimed by the Christian Church. Magic 
  may have been ascribed him over against the miracles recorded in the Gospels; 
  and the degrading fate both on earth and hereafter of which the legends speak 
  may be simply directed against the ideas of the assumption and the resurrection 
  of Jesus. The Jewish legends relating to Jesus appear less inimical in character 
  when compared with the parallel passages which are found in pagan authors and 
  Christian sources, more especially as such legends are fixed and frequently 
  occurring themes of folk-lore; and imaginations must have been especially excited 
  by the historical importance which the figure of Jesus came to have for the 
  Jews.</p>
<p>The earliest authenticated passage ascribing illegitimate birth to Jesus is 
  that in Yeb. iv. 3. The mysterious phrase (&quot;that man&quot;) cited in this 
  passage as occurring in a family register which R. Simeon ben Azza is said to 
  have found seems to indicate that it refers to Jesus (see Derenbourg in &quot;R. 
  E. J.&quot; i. 293), and here occur also the two expressions so often applied 
  to Jesus in later literature&#151; (= &quot;that anonymous one,&quot; the name 
  of Jesus being avoided) and (=&quot;bastard&quot;; for which in later times 
  was used). Such a family register may have been preserved at Jerusalem in the 
  Jud&aelig;o-Christian community.</p>
<p>Birth of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Jews, who are represented as inimical to Jesus in the canonical Gospels 
  also, took him to be legitimate and born in an entirely natural manner. A contrary 
  statement as to their attitude is expressed for the first time in the &quot;Acts 
  of Pilate&quot; (&quot;Gospel of Nicodemus,&quot; ed. Thilo, in &quot;Codex 
  Apoc. Novi Testamenti,&quot; i. 526, Leipsic, 1832; comp. Origen, &quot;Contra 
  Celsum,&quot; i. 28). Celsus makes the same statement in another passage, where 
  he refers even to a written source (??a????apta?), adding that the seducer was 
  a soldier by the name of Panthera (l.c. i. 32). The name &quot;Panthera&quot; 
  occurs here for the first time; two centuries later it occurs in Epiphanius 
  (&quot;H&aelig;res.&quot; lxxviii. 7), who ascribes the surname &quot;Panther&quot; 
  to Jacob, an ancestor of Jesus; and John of Damascus (&quot;De Orthod. Fide.&quot; 
  iv., &sect; 15) includes the names &quot;Panther&quot; and &quot;Barpanther&quot; 
  in the genealogy of Mary. It is certain, in any case, that the rabbinical sources 
  also regard Jesus as the &quot;son of Pandera&quot; (), although it is noteworthy 
  that he is called also &quot;Ben S?ada&quot; () (Shab. 104b; Sanh. 67a).</p>
<p>It appears from this passage that, aside from Pandera and S?ada, the couple 
  Pappus b. Judah and Miriam the hairdresser were taken to be the parents of Jesus. 
  Pappus has nothing to do with the story of Jesus, and was only connected with 
  it because his wife happened to be called &quot;Miriam&quot; (= &quot;Mary&quot;), 
  and was known to be an adulteress.</p>
<p>The one statement in which all these confused legends agree is that relating 
  to the birth of Jesus. Although this is ascribed only to the Jews, even in Celsus, 
  the Jews need not necessarily be regarded as its authors, for it is possible 
  that it originated among heretics inimical to Jesus, as the Ophites and Cainites, 
  of whom Origen says &quot;they uttered such hateful accusations against Jesus 
  as Celsus himself did&quot; (&quot;Contra Celsum,&quot; iii. 13). It is probable, 
  furthermore, that the accusation of illegitimacy was not originally considered 
  so serious; it was ascribed to the most prominent personages, and is a standing 
  motive in folk-lore (Krauss, &quot;Leben Jesu,&quot; p. 214).</p>
<p>The incident of Jesus concerning the dispute with the Scribes was copied by 
  the rabbinical sources (Kallah 18b [ed. Venice, 1528, fol. 41c]; comp. N. Coronel, 
  &quot;Comment. Quinque,&quot; p. 3b, Vienna, 1864, and &quot;Batte Midrashot,&quot; 
  ed. Wertheimer, iii. 23, Jerusalem, 1895). All the &quot;Toledot&quot; editions 
  contain a similar story of a dispute which Jesus carried on with the Scribes, 
  who, on the ground of that dispute, declared him to be a bastard. Analogous 
  to this story are numerous tales of predictions by precocious boys.</p>
<p>Sojourn in Egypt.</p>
<p>The sojourn of Jesus in Egypt is an essential part of the story of his youth. 
  According to the Gospels he was in that country in his early infancy, but Celsus 
  says that he was in service there and learned magic; hence he was there in early 
  manhood. This assumption may serve to throw more light on the obscure history 
  of Jesus than the account found in the Gospels. The Talmud also says that Jesus 
  was in Egypt in early manhood. R. Joshua b. Pera?yah is said to have fled with 
  his pupil Jesus to Alexandria in order to escape the persecutions of the Jewish 
  king Yannai (103-76 B.C.); on their return Jesus made a remark on the not faultless 
  beauty of their hostess, whereupon R. Joshua excommunicated him; and when Jesus 
  approached him again and was not received he set up a brick for his god, and 
  led all Israel into apostasy (Sanh. 107b; So?ah 47a; Yer. ?ag. 77d). This account 
  is supplemented by the statement, made on the assumption that Ben S?ada is identical 
  with Ben Pandera, that Ben S?ada brought magic from Egypt (Shab. 104b). The 
  story that Joshua b. Pera?yah, a contemporary of Simeon b. She?a?, was the teacher 
  of Jesus, is not clearly stated in the various &quot;Toledot&quot;; it is saidmerely 
  that Jesus was named after this brother of his mother. The assumption that Joshua 
  b. Pera?yah was the uncle of Jesus is confirmed by ?ir?isani, who wrote about 
  937 a history of Jewish sects (ed. Harkavy, &sect; 1, St. Petersburg, 1894; 
  comp. &quot;J. Q. R.&quot; vii. 687). The references to Yannai, Salome Alexandra, 
  and Joshua b. Pera?yah indicate that according to the Jewish legends the advent 
  of Jesus took place just one century before the actual historical date; and 
  some medieval apologists for Judaism, as Na?manides and Salman ?ebi, based on 
  this fact their assertion that the &quot;Yeshu'&quot; mentioned in the Talmud 
  was not identical with Jesus; this, however, is merely a subterfuge.</p>
<p>Jesus as Magician.</p>
<p>According to Celsus (in Origen, &quot;Contra Celsum,&quot; i. 28) and to the 
  Talmud (Shab. 104b), Jesus learned magic in Egypt and performed his miracles 
  by means of it; the latter work, in addition, states that he cut the magic formulas 
  into his skin. It does not mention, however, the nature of his magic performances 
  (Tosef., Shab. xi. 4; Yer. Shab. 13d); but as it states that the disciples of 
  Jesus healed the sick &quot;in the name of Jesus Pandera&quot; (Yer. Shab. 14d; 
  'Ab. Zarah 27b; Eccl. R. i. 8) it may be assumed that its author held the miracles 
  of Jesus also to have been miraculous cures. Different in nature is the witchcraft 
  attributed to Jesus in the &quot;Toledot.&quot; When Jesus was expelled from 
  the circle of scholars, he is said to have returned secretly from Galilee to 
  Jerusalem, where he inserted a parchment containing the &quot;declared name 
  of God&quot; (&quot;Shem ha-Meforash&quot;), which was guarded in the Temple, 
  into his skin, carried it away, and then, taking it out of his skin, he performed 
  his miracles by its means. This magic formula then had to be recovered from 
  him, and Judah the Gardener (a personage of the &quot;Toledot&quot; corresponding 
  to Judas Iscariot) offered to do it; he and Jesus then engaged in an aerial 
  battle (borrowed from the legend of Simon Magus), in which Judah remained victor 
  and Jesus fled.</p>
<p>The accusation of magic is frequently brought against Jesus. Jerome mentions 
  it, quoting the Jews: &quot;Magum vocant et Jud&aelig;i Dominum meum&quot; (&quot;Ep. 
  lv., ad Ascellam,&quot; i. 196, ed. Vallarsi); Marcus, of the sect of the Valentinians, 
  was, according to Jerome, a native of Egypt, and was accused of being, like 
  Jesus, a magician (Hilgenfeld, &quot;Ketzergesch.&quot; p. 370, Leipsic, 1884). 
  There were even Christian heretics who looked upon the founder of their religion 
  as a magician (Fabricius, in &quot;Codex Apocr. Novi Testamenti,&quot; iii. 
  396), and public opinion at Rome accused all Christians of magic (W. M. Ramsay, 
  &quot;The Church in the Roman Empire Before A.D. 170,&quot; pp. 236, 392, London, 
  1897). The Apostles were regarded in the same light (&quot;Acta Petri et Andre&aelig;,&quot; 
  ed. Bonnet, &sect; 8). Neither this accusation nor that concerning the birth 
  of Jesus is found in the canonical Gospels, but it occurs in the apocryphal 
  accounts; e.g., &quot;Gesta Pilati,&quot; ii. 1; &quot;Acta Pilati,&quot; version 
  B, ii. 3, iii. 1; ib. i. 1 (&micro;a?e?a?; comp. ???? ?st?? = &quot;he is a 
  magician&quot;); ib. in ed. Tischendorf, 2d ed., p. 216, &quot;maleficus est&quot;; 
  ib. p. 338 (&quot;Zeit. f&uuml;r die Neutest. Wissenschaft,&quot; 1901, iii. 
  94), with which comp &quot;veneficus&quot; = &quot;poisoner&quot; (&quot;Evang. 
  Infanti&aelig; Arab.&quot; ed. Thilo, &sect; 36). Somewhat different is the 
  accusation that Jesus imposed upon the people and led them astray (comp. Bischoff, 
  &quot;Ein J&uuml;disch. Deutsches Leben Jesu,&quot; p. 20, Leipsic, 1895: , 
  often also , and in the Greek texts p?a???, ?a?p?a???; comp. p?a?? t?? ????? 
  = &quot;he deceives the people&quot;; John vii. 12). As Balaam the magician 
  and, according to the derivation of his name, &quot;destroyer of the people,&quot; 
  was from both of these points of view a good prototype of Jesus, the latter 
  was also called &quot;Balaam.&quot;</p>
<p>The Disciples of Jesus.</p>
<p>Celsus (i. 62) says there were ten or eleven apostles. A passage of the Talmud 
  (Sanh. 43a) ascribes five disciples to Jesus: &quot;Matthai&quot; (Matthew), 
  &quot;Nakai&quot; (Luke), &quot;Nezer&quot; (Nazarene, a general designation 
  for Christian in antiquity), &quot;Boni&quot; (probably the Nicodemus mentioned 
  by John), and &quot;Thoda&quot; (Thadd&aelig;us). The following are mentioned 
  in the &quot;Toledot&quot; (Huldricus, p. 35): &quot;Simeon&quot; (Peter), &quot;Matthia&quot; 
  (Matthew), &quot;Elikum&quot; (Luke), &quot;Mordecai&quot; (Mark), &quot;Thoda&quot; 
  (Thadd&aelig;us), and &quot;Johannos&quot; (John)&#151;that is, the four evangelists 
  plus Peter and Thadd&aelig;us. Paul is mentioned in another connection, and 
  (p. 48) Judas &quot;the betrayer&quot;: it is to be noted that the last-named 
  does not occur at all in Talmudic legends. The Twelve Apostles are mentioned 
  in other versions of the &quot;Toledot&quot; (ed. Wagenseil, p. 19; ed. Bischoff, 
  p. 21), while still other versions frequently mention a following of 300, 310, 
  320, 330 men. It is especially striking that all these disciples are described 
  as eminently wise and learned, while according to Celsus (i. 63, ii. 46) the 
  disciples of Jesus were common men, toll-keepers and seamen, an assumption that 
  agrees to some extent with the canonical Gospels.</p>
<p>The Doctrines of Jesus.</p>
<p>In all the editions of the &quot;Toledot&quot; the doctrine of Jesus is summed 
  up in the statements that he was the son of God, born of a virgin mother, a 
  descendant of David and the promised Messiah; this he proved from passages of 
  Scripture, in the rabbinic-Talmudic manner. In connection with these statements 
  he is also represented as engaging in disputations with Jewish scholars. The 
  only specifically Christian doctrine mentioned by the Talmud is (Shab. 116a, 
  b) that the law of Moses has been annulled and the Gospels put in its place&#151;the 
  well-known Christian doctrine of the abrogation of the Law; the saying of Jesus, 
  &quot;I have not come to take away the law of Moses, but to add to it,&quot; 
  is also cited (ib.). In the &quot;Toledot&quot; the doctrine of abrogation is 
  put into the mouth of Peter, and the latter, secretly intending to separate 
  the Christians from the community in the interest of the Jews, promulgates the 
  following tenets: Jesus suffered the pain and punishment of death in order to 
  redeem from hell those that believe in him (comp. I Cor. xv. 26, 55); believers 
  shall not hurt the Jews (comp. Acts iii. 26); one who deserves to be accompanied 
  one mile only shall be accompanied two miles; both cheeks shall be offered if 
  one cheek has been struck (comp. Matt. v. 39-41); instead of the Sabbath, Sunday 
  shall be kept holy; Easter shall be celebrated instead of the Passover, Pentecost 
  instead of the Feast of Weeks, etc.; circumcision is abrogated, and the dietary 
  laws annulled. All these doctrinesare merely external, while the essential points 
  of the teachings of Jesus are hardly alluded to.</p>
<p>Jesus performed all his miracles by means of magic, as stated above. These 
  miracles are not specified in the Talmud, but they are in the &quot;Tole-dot&quot;; 
  they are partly such as are mentioned in the Gospels, as the healing of the 
  halt, blind, and leprous, and are somewhat different in nature, though based 
  on the Gospels, as the story of Jesus walking on the sea on a heavy millstone 
  (&quot;Toledot&quot;&#151;ed. Wagenseil, p. 14; ed. Huldricus, p. 43; ed. Bischoff, 
  p. 25; MS. Adler, in Krauss, &quot;Leben Jesu,&quot; p. 119; comp. Matt. xiv. 
  25, xviii. 6). Other miracles are derived from apocryphal accounts, as the story 
  that Jesus fashioned birds from clay or marble and put life into them; this 
  occurs also in the &quot;Gospel of Thomas,&quot; in &quot;Evang. Infanti&aelig; 
  Arab.&quot; &sect; 36 (Thilo, ib. i. 111), and in the Koran. These legends are 
  much amplified in the later &quot;Toledot,&quot; although the substance remains 
  the same.</p>
<p>Trial and Death of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Talmudic account of the manner of executing a person guilty of leading 
  the people astray (Sanh. 67a) would be of signal historical importance if it 
  were certain that it referred to Jesus. The proceeding against one who incites 
  others to deny the religion of their fathers consists in convicting him of his 
  guilt by means of concealed witnesses, as follows: The accused is placed in 
  an inner room with a light, so that witnesses unknown to him and watching him 
  from an outer room can see and hear him clearly. Then a companion says to him: 
  &quot;Tell me again what you told me in confidence [in regard to renouncing 
  our religion].&quot; If he does so, the other replies: &quot;How could we leave 
  our God in heaven and serve idols?&quot; If he recants now, it is well; but 
  if he says, &quot;It is our duty and we must do it,&quot; then the witnesses 
  outside take him into court and he is stoned. &quot;Thus they did with Ben S?ada 
  at Lydda, who was hanged on the eve of the Passover.&quot; This passage refers 
  to Jesus only if he is regarded as identical with Ben S?ada; this can hardly 
  be assumed in view of the reference to Lydda. The frequently repeated statement 
  that Jesus was condemned for inciting to apostasy () is based on Sanh. 43a; 
  there is added the entirely improbable statement that forty days before the 
  condemnation of Jesus a herald called upon any one who could say anything in 
  his favor to come forward and testify, but that no one appeared.</p>
<p>The proceeding is related very differently in the &quot;Toledot&quot;; although 
  the several editions of the same differ in detail they agree in substance. The 
  following account is found in a rather old edition (see Krauss, l.c. pp. 43 
  et seq.). The scholars of Israel took Jesus into the synagogue of Tiberias and 
  bound him to a pillar; when his followers came to liberate him, a battle occurred 
  in which the Jewish party was worsted and his disciples took him to Antiochia. 
  On the eve of Passover he entered Jerusalem riding on an ass (comp. Matt. xxi. 
  4-17), disguised&#151;according to several editions&#151;so that his former 
  disciple Judas had to betray him in order to secure his seizure. He was executed 
  on the eve of the Passover festival, which was also the eve of the Sabbath. 
  The executioners were not able to hang him upon a tree, for he had conjured 
  all trees, by means of the name of God, not to receive him, and therefore they 
  all broke; he was finally received by a large cabbagestalk (comp. Targ. Sheni 
  to Esth. vii. 9). He was buried on the same day, in conformity with the Law, 
  and the apostates, his disciples, wept at his tomb.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Toledot&quot; his disciples sought for his body in the 
  tomb, but being unable to find it they used the incident as proof before Queen 
  Helena that he who had been slain had ascended into heaven. It then appeared 
  that a man&#151;sometimes called &quot;Judas the Gardener&quot; (Judas Iscariot), 
  sometimes, indefinitely, the &quot;master of the garden&quot;&#151;had taken 
  the body out of the grave, used it as a dam to keep the water out of his garden, 
  and had flooded the tomb. Then there was joy again in Israel; the body was taken 
  before the queen at Jerusalem, and the Christians were shamed. Three points 
  deserve notice in this account: (1) The fact that the body was stolen. According 
  to Matt. xxvii. 64, the Pharisees asked Pilate to guard the tomb so that the 
  disciples might not steal the body and say that Jesus had ascended into heaven; 
  but when the report was nevertheless circulated that Jesus had ascended, the 
  Pharisees bribed the soldiers to say that the body had been stolen by the disciples 
  (Matt. xxviii. 13). The &quot;Gospel of Nikodemus,&quot; &sect; 13 (Thilo, ib. 
  i. 616), adds that the Jews still persisted in this statement. A similar story 
  is known to Justin (&quot;Dial. cum Tryph.&quot; &sect; 108; comp. &sect; 17) 
  and Eusebius (&quot;Hist. Eccl.&quot; ch. iv. 18), while in the pseudo-Clementine 
  &quot;Recognitiones&quot; (i., &sect; 42) this assertion is ascribed to &quot;others&quot; 
  (probably the Jews). (2) The statement of the theft of the body and the statement 
  of the gardener who was afraid that the multitude of disciples might destroy 
  his lettuce-beds were both known to Tertullian (&quot;De Spectaculis,&quot; 
  &sect; 30). (3) The insult offered to the body in the streets of Jerusalem is 
  alluded to in the Koran (see below).</p>
<p>The Resurrection.</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that the Jewish legends deny the resurrection of Jesus; 
  the halakic assertion that Balaam (i.e., the prototype of Jesus) had no part 
  in the future life must also be especially noted (Sanh. x. 2). It is further 
  said: &quot;The pupils of the recreant Balaam inherit hell&quot; (Abot v. 19). 
  Jesus is accordingly, in the following curious Talmudic legend, thought to sojourn 
  in hell. A certain On?elos b. ?aloni?os, son of Titus' sister, desired to embrace 
  Judaism, and called up from hell by magic first Titus, then Balaam, and finally 
  Jesus, who are here taken together as the worst enemies of Judaism. He asked 
  Jesus: &quot;Who is esteemed in that world?&quot; Jesus said: &quot;Israel.&quot; 
  &quot;Shall one join them?&quot; Jesus said to him: &quot;Further their well-being; 
  do nothing to their detriment; whoever touches them touches even the apple of 
  His eye.&quot; On?elos then asked the nature of his punishment, and was told 
  that it was the degrading fate of those who mock the wise (Gi?. 56b-57a). This 
  most revolting passage was applied in the Middle Ages to another Jesus (e.g., 
  by R. Je?iel, in the Paris disputation; &quot;Wikkua?,&quot; p. 4, Thorn, 1873). 
  A parallel to the story is found in the statement of the &quot;Toledot&quot; 
  that when Judas found he could not touch Jesus in any way in theaerial battle, 
  he defiled him. This feature naturally especially angered Christians (see Wagenseil, 
  &quot;Tela Ignea Satan&aelig;,&quot; p. 77). According to a passage in the Zohar 
  (Steinschneider, &quot;Polemische Litteratur,&quot; p. 362) the same degrading 
  fate is meted out to both Jesus and Mohammed.</p>
<p>Legends regarding Jesus are found in Mohammedan folk-lore. Although the innocence 
  of Mary is most emphatically asserted, there are such striking parallels to 
  Jewish legends that this material must certainly have been taken from Judaism 
  into the Koran. In that work, also, it is stated that Jesus formed birds out 
  of clay and endowed them with life (sura iii. 43); both the Koran and Jalal 
  al-Din (in Maracci, &quot;Refutatio Alcorani,&quot; fol. 114b, Patavii, 1698) 
  refer to the peculiar clothing worn by the disciples of Jesus; and in Ibn Said 
  (Maracci, l.c. fol. 113b) is found the statement that the body of Jesus was 
  dragged with ropes through the streets.</p>
<p>Karaites and Samaritans.</p>
<p>The cardinal point in the Jewish legends concerns the birth of Jesus. This 
  question is discussed by both the Samaritans (&quot;Chronique Samaritaine,&quot; 
  ed. Neubauer, p. 18, Paris, 1873) and the Karaites, as may be seen in a recently 
  published passage from the work of the Karaite Judah Hadassi (&quot;J. Q. R.&quot; 
  viii. 440). Other essential points are that Jesus performed his miracles by 
  conjuring with the name of God (ib. viii. 436), and the legend appended to the 
  &quot;Toledot&quot; editions regarding the finding of the cross (ib. viii. 438). 
  The Karaites, however, had their own &quot;Toledot.&quot; Meswi al'Akkbari, 
  the founder of a Karaite sect, engaged in similar polemics against the Christian 
  doctrines (&quot;R. E. J.&quot; xxxiv. 182).</p>
<p>Antichrist Legends.</p>
<p>The Jewish legends referring to Jesus can not be regarded as originally purely 
  Jewish, because the Christian Antichrist legends also make use of them. The 
  Antichrist is born of a wandering virgin, the latter being, according to one 
  version, a Danitic, hence Jewish, woman, while the father belongs to the Latin 
  race (corresponding to the Roman soldier Panthera). Similar details are found 
  in the Armilus legend (Bousset, &quot;Der Antichrist,&quot; p. 99, G&ouml;ttingen, 
  1895; Krauss, &quot;Das Leben Jesu,&quot; p. 216).</p>

<p align="center">'AM HA-ARE?<br>
</p>
<p align="center"> By : Kaufmann Kohler </p>
<p>ARTICLE HEADINGS:<br>
  Historical Origin. <br>
  Antipathy of the Pharisees. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A term used in common parlance in the sense of &quot;ignoramus,&quot; applied 
  particularly to one ignorant of Jewish matters. Compare Gamaliel's maxim (Abot, 
  ii. 5): &quot;No 'Am ha-Are? can be pious [?asid]; also Lev. R. xxxvii.: &quot;Jephthah, 
  the judge, who failed to obtain release from his rash vow, was an 'Am ha-Are?&quot;&#151;that 
  is, &quot;one of the multitude which knows not the Law&quot; (see John, vii. 
  49). According to the Tannaim of the second century an 'Am ha-Are? is &quot;he 
  who does not eat his ordinary food in a state of priestly purity&quot; (R. Meir); 
  or, according to the majority of rabbis, &quot;he who does not give his tithes 
  in due manner&quot;; according to R. Eliezer, it is &quot;he who does not read 
  the Shema' evening and morning&quot;; according to R. Joshua, &quot;he who does 
  not put on the phylacteries [tefillin]&quot;; according to Ben 'Azzai, &quot;he 
  who does not wear fringes [?i?it] on his garments&quot;; according to R. Nathan, 
  &quot;he who has no mezuzah on his door-post&quot; (Deut. vi. 9); according 
  to R. Nathan ben Joseph, &quot;he who has children and does not educate them 
  in the Law&quot;; and according to others, &quot;he who has not associated with 
  the wise in order to learn the practise of the oral law&quot; (Ber. 47b; So?ah, 
  22a; Gi?. 61a). Ishmael b. Eleazar says: &quot;The 'amme ha-are? [the vulgar 
  crowds] incur the penalty of death by the disregard with which they treat the 
  sacred Ark and the synagogue, calling the one simply 'chest' and the other 'the 
  people's house'&quot; (Shab. 32a).</p>
<p>'Am ha-Are? meaning literally &quot;the people of the land&quot; or &quot;the 
  rural population,&quot; this appellation, like pagan from &quot;pagus&quot; 
  or heathen from &quot;heath&quot; in the early Christian centuries, came to 
  denote the country people inaccessible to, or untouched by, the influence of 
  the teachings offered by the religious community&#151;in a word, by the Synagogue.</p>
<p>Historical Origin.</p>
<p>The history of the term 'Am ha-Are? leads us back to the beginning of the second 
  commonwealth, or rather to the time of the exile, when &quot;none remained, 
  save the poorest sort of the people of the land&quot; (II Kings, xxiv. 14): 
  these had mingled with the rest of the surrounding people and lost their specific 
  character as Jews. Then Ezra and Nehemiah made &quot;separations from the peoples 
  of the lands ['amme-ha-ara?ot] the condition of admission to the congregation 
  (Ezra, ix. 1; Neh. x. 31). Henceforth separation from the lawless multitude 
  became the watchword, and the result was the formation of the party of the Separatists 
  (&quot;?asidim&quot; = the pious; like the Aram&aelig;an &quot;Perushim&quot; 
  = those that separate themselves from all impurity). United in associations 
  (?aberim) in every town for common worship and common meals, as well as for 
  communal works of charity, the faithful observers of the law (Pharisees) shunned 
  any contact with an 'Am ha-Are?, any one of &quot;the vulgar crowd,&quot; as 
  defiling, because such a one failed to observe conscientiously the Levitical 
  laws of purity, or to give the portions of his produce due to the priest and 
  the Levite. Moreover, he was regarded as a transgressor of the law, since he 
  neglected to fulfil all those duties which the religious practise of the synagogue 
  had in the course of time introduced as means of the sanctification of life. 
  The very touch of his garment was defiling to the members of the Pharisaic brotherhood 
  (?ag. ii. 7), nor was he trusted in matters of Levitical purity or of tithes 
  even as a witness in court (Dem. ii. 2 et seq., Pes. 49b). As a matter of course, 
  no marriage relations with him were entered into by the Pharisees.</p>
<p>Antipathy of the Pharisees.</p>
<p>Such exclusiveness naturally tended to intensify the hatred between the masses 
  and the Pharisees, and bitter expressions were used on both sides which can 
  scarcely be taken literally. &quot;When I was one of the uneducated, I used 
  to say, 'Give me one of the learned scribes that I may bite him like an ass,'&quot; 
  said R. Akiba. R. Eliezer says, if they were subject to the 'Am ha-Are?, they 
  could not be sure of their lives. Accordingly it is declared that an 'Am ha-Are? 
  is so dangerous a man that he may be killed on the &quot;Sabbath of Sabbaths&quot;; 
  or says another, &quot;torn like a fish&quot; (Pes. 49b). Such expressions have 
  been taken perhaps too seriously by Montefiore (&quot;Hibbert Lectures,&quot; 
  1892, p. 499); on the other hand, Lazarus (&quot;Ethics of Judaism,&quot; i. 
  appendix, note 48a, p. 258, English translation) goes too far in the other direction, 
  taking them as mere jests. That a hostile feeling prevailed, is shown by the 
  expression in John, vii. 49: &quot;this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.&quot; 
  Even more animosity is shown in the halakic dictum of Joshua ben Levi in the 
  name of Antigonus: &quot;The claim of the ?aber upon the charity-treasury to 
  provide his wife with raiment is greater than that of the 'Am ha-Are? for the 
  support of his life&quot; (Yer. Hor. iii. 48a; compare also B. B. 8a).</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that it was this contemptuous and hostile attitude of 
  the Pharisaic schools toward the masses that was the chief cause of the triumphant 
  power of the Christian church. In preaching the good tidings to the poor and 
  the out-cast, Jesus of Nazareth won the great masses of Judea. The Pharisaic 
  schools, laying all stress on the Law and on learning, held the 'Am ha-Are? 
  in utter contempt. The new Christian sect recruited itself chiefly from the 
  ranks of the untaught, laying special stress on the merits of the simple and 
  thehumble. As Montefiore well says: &quot;The 'Am haAre? was probably the creation 
  of the burdensome agrarian and purity laws.&quot; Still it is hardly correct 
  to say that &quot;after the destruction of the Temple the 'Am ha-Are? slowly 
  disappeared.&quot; Nor is it more than mere conjecture of Hamburger that during 
  the war of Bar-Kokba the 'Am ha-Are? furnished the informers and traitors. R. 
  Judah at the close of the second century still points to the gulf separating 
  the 'Am ha-Are? from the learned, and Judah ha-Nasi refuses him a share of the 
  communal charity, probably because his disciples required it all for their own 
  support (B. B. 8a). Now and then hatred gives way to love, as in the following: 
  &quot;A man should not say, 'Love the pupils of the wise but hate the 'Am ha-Are?'; 
  but one should love all and hate only the heretics, the apostates, and informers, 
  following David, who says: 'Those that hate Thee, O Lord, I hate'&quot; (Ps. 
  cxxxix. 21; Ab. R. N. ed. Schechter, xvi. 64). Again, &quot;he who teaches the 
  son of an 'Am ha-Are? the Law, for him the Lord will annul every misfortune 
  decreed upon him&quot; (B. M. 85a).</p>
