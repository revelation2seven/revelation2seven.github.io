    </font> </i>(Woe to Jerusalem, Woe in the East, Woe in the North, Woe in the

    him, What did Jesus say unto you?</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thomas said to them, If I tell one of the things which 
    he told me, you will pick up stones and throw them at me </font></i>(see Deuteronomy 
    13:1-10)<font size="+1"><i>, and when you do a fire will come out of the stones 
    and burn you up...</i>(The Gospel of Thomas 13). </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>The secret words that the Savior spoke to Judas Thomas 
    which I, Mathaias, wrote down, while I was walking, listening to them speak 
    with one another.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Savior said, Brother Thomas, while you have time in 
    the world listen to me, and I will reveal to you things that you have pondered 
    in your mind.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Now since it has been said that you are my twin and true 
    companion, examine yourself and learn who you are, in what way you exist, 
    and how you will come to be. Since you will be called my brother it is not 
    fitting that you be ignorant of yourself. And I know that you have understood, 
    because you have already understood that I am the knowledge of the Truth. 
    So while you accompany me, although you are uncomprehending, you have already 
    come to know, and you will be called the one who knows himself. For he who 
    has not known himself has known nothing, but he who has known himself has 
    at the same time received knowledge about the depth of all. So, then, you, 
    my brother Thomas, have beheld what is obscure to men, that is, what they 
    ignorantly stumble against.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Now Thomas said to the Lord, Therefore I beg you to tell 
    me what I ask of you before your ascension, and when I hear from you about 
    the hidden things, then I can speak about them. And it is obvious to me that 
    the truth is difficult to perform before men.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Savior answered, saying, If the things that are visible 
    to you are obscure to you, how can you hear about the things that are not 
    visible? If the deeds of truth that are visible in the world are difficult 
    for you to perform, how indeed shall you perform those that pertain to the 
    exalted Height and to the Pleroma (the Fulness) which are not visible? And 
    how shall you be called laborers? In this respect you are apprentices, and 
    have not yet received the Height of Perfection.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Now Thomas answered, and said, Tell us about these things 
    that you say are invisible, but are hidden from us?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Savior said...visible bodies survive by devouring 
    creatures similar to them with the result that the body changes. Now that 
    which changes will decay and perish, and has no hope of life from then on, 
    SINCE THAT BODY IS BESTIAL. So just as the body of THE BEAST perishes, so 
    will all these formations </font></i>(such as nations and empires)<font size="+1"> 
    <i>perish also.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And Thomas answered, Therefore I say unto you, Lord, that 
    those who speak about things that are invisible and difficult to explain are 
    like those who shoot their arrows at a target by night. To be sure they shoot 
    their arrows as anyone would--since they shoot at the target--but it is not 
    visible. Yet when the light comes forth and hides </font></i>(puts aside)<i><font size="+1"> 
    the darkness, then the work of each will appear. And you, Your Light, enlighten, 
    O Lord.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Jesus said, It is in the Light </font></i>(of reality 
    itself)<font size="+1"> </font><i><font size="+1">that light exists.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thomas spoke, saying, Lord, why does this visible light 
    </font></i>(the Sun)<font size="+1"> </font><i><font size="+1">that shines 
    on behalf of men rise and set?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Savior said, O blessed Thomas, of course this visible 
    light shines on your behalf--not in order that you remain here, but rather 
    that you might come forth--and whenever the elect abandons bestiality </font></i>(not 
    sexuality as some in the church would have it)<i><font size="+1">, then this 
    light will withdraw up to its essence, and its essence will welcome it, since 
    it is a Good Servant...</font></i><font size="+1">(The Book of Thomas the 
    Contender, the Nag Hammadi Library).</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;WOODROW WILSON was a great 
    war leader and crusader for world peace who insisted that the United States 
    must share responsibility for maintaining international stability. In his 
    first term he brought to fruition a basic program of progressive reform the 
    New Freedom. In his second term he mobilized the manpower and industrial might 
    of the United States, which helped bring an Allied victory in the war to make 
    the world &quot;safe for democracy.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson sought to implement that 
    ideal through the League of Nations, but the Senate blocked the entrance of 
    the United States into the league and frustrated his dream.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps because his earliest memories 
    were of the Civil War, Wilson's most earnest hope was for permanent peace. 
    He was born in Staunton, Virginia, in 1856, the son of a Presbyterian minister 
    who during the Civil War had a church in Augusta, Georgia, and during Reconstruction 
    taught theology in charred Columbia, South Carolina...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson was raised in the traditions 
    of the South; he was proud the Confederates had fought, but was glad the Union 
    survived.</font></p>

  MAN&quot; ENTERS POLITICS</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After being graduated from Princeton...and 
    attending the University of Virginia Law School, Wilson practiced law in Atlanta. 
    But finding law practice uncongenial, he subsequently earned a Ph.D at the 
    John Hopkins University and began an academic career. His hope, as he told 
    his future wife, Ellen Louise Axson, was to move on to statesmanship.&quot;

  WILSON AND THE NEW FREEDOM</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is not a day of triumph; 
    it is a day of dedication. Here muster not the forces of the party, but the 
    forces of humanity...I summons all honest men, all patriotic, all forward 
    looking men to my side. God helping me I will not fail them, if they will 
    but counsel and sustain me.&quot; </font>Inaugural Address, 1913<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson was not only born a Southern 
    Democrat, but he developed into a Democrat steeped in the ultra-liberal Jeffersonian 
    tradition. Like Jefferson...he had a strong faith in the judgment of the masses, 
    if they were properly informed. </font>(Thus the words: <i>And they worshipped 
    the dragon</i>--the collective lower consciousness of man--<i>which gave its 
    power unto the Beast</i>...Rev.12)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The son of a Presbyterian minister, 
    Wilson was reared in an atmosphere of extreme piety. He believed devoutly 
    in the power of prayer and in the presence of a personal God. </font>(See 
    Daniel 4:34-37)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...At heart a clergyman, 
    he later used the presidential pulpit to preach his inspirational public sermons.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson was not only a born reformer 
    but an idealist who could radiate righteous indignation. Moved by a stern 
    sense of duty when he saw wrongdoing, he would become &quot;angry for the 
    right.&quot; As an earnest Christian who habitually read his Bible and prayed 
    in the bosom of his family, he hated war so much that he became at heart a 
    pacifist. Such tendencies were reinforced by his boyhood years in Yankee-gutted 
    Georgia.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Idealism Enthroned</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The man and the hour providentially 
    met. The lover of peace, as fate would have it, emerged as a magnificent leader 
    of war. Flourishing the sword of righteousness, he aroused, almost hypnotized, 
    the nation with his inspirational ideals.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson's burning idealism led him 
    instinctively to the right course. Radiating the spiritual fervor of his Presbyterian 
    forbears, he proclaimed the twin goals of &quot;a war to end war,&quot; and 
    a crusade &quot;to make the world safe for democracy.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This war, unlike most of its predecessors, 
    was fought with a high degree of unity and enthusiasm. At the outset there 
    existed considerable confusion, and even downright opposition, especially 
    among the German community of the Middle West. But Wilson, holding aloft the 
    torch of idealism, mobilized public emotion into an almost frenzied outburst. 
    &quot;Force, force to the utmost&quot; he cried, while the country responded 
    less elegantly with &quot;Hang the Kaiser.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The entire nation, catching the 
    spirit of a religious revival, burst into song &quot;Over there...send the 
    word...that the Yanks are coming. The drums rum-tumming everywhere.&quot;</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Baha'is, a religious 
    sect founded by a Persian mystic, believed that Isaiah of the Bible was talking 
    about President Woodrow Wilson when he prophesied: 'For unto us a child is 
    born, unto us a son is given, and his name shall be called...the Prince of 
    Peace'... The war meant something almost as dramatic to many who took themselves 
    to be ordinary Christians. This has been 'Christ's war,' commented the Los 
    Angeles Times. 'Christ on one side, and all that stood opposed to Christ on 
    the other side,'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At seven in the morning...factory 
    whistles blew and church bells rang in every hamlet and city in the country. 
    State officials sat expectantly at long tables ready to hand out green draft 
    cards to anyone who lined up to register his name, address and age. This was 
    the test day, the moment of truth for the government's war policy...By noon 
    apprehension among the state officials turned to rejoicing. The young men 
    of the country were indeed turning out...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was little trouble anywhere, 
    and it was easily put down wherever it occurred. The newspapers reported that 
    in Racine, Wisconsin:<font size="+1"> </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John 
    Robush, employed at the J.I. Case Tin Company was forced to kiss the American 
    flag by 300 of his fellow employees after he declared that he would not register 
    and would not fight for the United States. The man was made to crawl on his 
    knees to the flag which had been spread upon the floor and after kissing it 
    compelled to salute.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time Ute Indians of 
    Colorado refused to register under the Selective Service Act and spent most 
    of the day dancing war and 'bear' dances in native costumes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other parts of the country, 
    scattered groups of conscientious objectors who refused to register for the 
    draft were quietly put in jail...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Wilson's urging, the United 
    States...passed a law that threatened a 20-year jail sentence to anyone who 
    'shall willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, 
    or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces of the United States...Thousands 
    of people were sent to jail for their antiwar speeches and writings, and thousands 
    more were frightened into silence.</font></p>

    told his Vermont Bible class that 'a Christian can take no part in the war,' 
    he was sentenced to 15 years in the Atlanta penitentiary.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The day before Wilson was expected 
    to deliver his message to congress, the Reverend John Haynes Holmes, the pacifist 
    minister of a church in New York, stood in the pulpit and told a stunned congregation:<font size="+1"> 
    </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'War is an open violation 
    of Christianity. If war is right then Christianity is wrong, false, a lie. 
    If Christianity is right then war is wrong, false, a lie...When or if the 
    system of conscription is adopted, I shall have to decline to serve. If this 
    means a fine, I will pay my fine. If this means persecution, I will carry 
    my cross. No order of President, no law of nation or state, no loss of reputation, 
    freedom or life, will persuade me or force me to this business of killing.'...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Such stories of true spiritual conviction, bravery and self-sacrifice 
  go on and on, from the First World War to the present. They can and will fill 
  volumes. Pacifists, religious and non-religious alike, stood side by side in 
  a cause that was not only unpopular but dangerous to uphold. One young man named 
  Ernest Meyer wrote from his prison cell:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'I wish that we war objectors were 
    not the miserable handful that we are, but a clamoring host, so that word 
    of our existence would travel on the wind to all corners, and men everywhere 
    would spike their guns and refuse longer to serve the warrior-imperialists 
    who have betrayed them. We are so few now. But late, in the next war--for 
    more will come, be sure of it--our ranks may be formidable...our folded arms 
    all powerful.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For one fleeting moment, Ernest 
    Meyer forgot about his loneliness and boredom as he contemplated a distant 
    future when thousands of young idealists like himself would act as he believed 
    real patriots should act and refuse to bear arms.&quot; </font>Hooray For

<p align="center"><font size="+2">A Psychological Study</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">by Sigmund Freud and William C. Bullitt</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Three months after Wilson's inauguration 
    as President of Princeton his father died. His entire life had been dominated 
    by his relationship to his father. The loss of his father, therefore, necessitated 
    a considerable rearrangement of the outlets of his libido.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the customary manner, he replaced 
    his lost father by himself and thenceforth in his unconscious he was more 
    than ever the Reverend Joseph Ruggles Wilson. Thus he found a new outlet for 
    his aggressive activity to his father...After his father's death his addiction 
    to speech-making, which was already excessive, grew to fantastic proportions; 
    his desire for a friend to love became an imperative need; and his interest 
    in all forms of religious activity increased...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, after the loss of his 
    father, he began to display increased inclination imperiously to rearrange 
    the world and to hate with unreasonable intensity distinguished men who disagreed 
    with him. The charge of libido in his passivity to his father was evidently 
    too great for the outlets which remained in existence to carry its full flow. 
    After his father's death Wilson had to repress a large portion of it. As we 
    pointed out, the Ego invariably employs a reaction-formation to assist in 
    the repression of a strong desire. The amount of passivity to his father which 
    had to be repressed...was great and it required a large reaction-formation 
    to assist in its repression. That reaction-formation found outlet through 
    his attempts to rearrange the world and through hostile actions against father 
    representatives.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original source of all these 
    character traits was, of course, little Tommy Wilson's passivity to his &quot;incomparable 
    father.&quot; The Reverend Joseph Ruggles Wilson, who incidentally is not 
    to be recommended as a model for fathers, had made his son love him so deeply 
    and submissively that the flood of passivity he had aroused could be satisfied 
    by no other man or activity. To find outlet for it was not easy for a man 
    whose Super-Ego demanded that he should be all masculinity: <i>GOD HIMSELF</i>. 
    The Professor Extraordinary of Rhetoric, dead, continued to overwhelm his 
    son.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson, installed as President 
    of Princeton, began at once to dominate the life of the university. He dismissed 
    various professors, increased the severity of examinations, sharpened discipline, 
    resisted an agitation for the abolition of compulsory daily attendance at 
    chapel and reorganized the entire course of study... (pp.112,113).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1916...To do nothing (about the 
    situation in Europe) was impossible. He asked House to prepare a stiff cable 
    to Grey. House sent Grey various messages the gist of which was: either accept 
    Wilson as dictator of the peace or look out for trouble. Wilson's hope emerged 
    in his address of the following weeks. On May 20, 1916, he said: &quot;I would 
    like, therefore, to think the spirit of this occasion could be expressed if 
    we imagined ourselves lifting some sacred emblem of counsel and of peace, 
    of accommodation and righteous judgment before the nations of the world and 
    reminding them of that passage in the Scripture: </font><i><font size="+1">After 
    the wind, after the earthquake, after the fire, the still small voice of humanity</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    On May 30, 1916, he said: AND THIS SPIRIT IS GOING OUT CONQUERING AND TO CONQUER<i> 
    </i></font><font size="2">(Rev.6:2)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> 
    </i>until, it may be, in the Providence of God, a new light is lifted up in 
    America which shall throw the rays of liberty and justice far abroad upon 
    every sea, and even upon the lands which now wallow in darkness and refuse 
    to see the light.&quot; He was ready to lift up his light and let it shine 
    even upon Germany. &quot;Came he not into the world to save sinners?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson finally began to feel that 
    the Allies, not Germany, stood between him and achievement of his desire to 
    be the SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD and became extremely angry at them. He ceased 
    to talk about the war as if all right were on the side of the Allies and all 
    wrong on the side of the Germans. On July 23, 1916, he wrote to House: &quot;I 
    am, I must admit, about at the end of my patience with Great Britain and the 
    Allies...I am seriously considering asking Congress to authorize me to prohibit 
    loans and restrict exportations to the Allies. It is becoming clear to me 
    that there lies latent in this policy the wish to prevent the merchants getting 
    a foothold in markets which Great Britain has hitherto controlled and all 
    but dominated....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From October 17, 1915, when he 
    dispatched the letter which he believed would lead to his being called to 
    make the peace, to March 26, 1916, when the torpedoing of the <i>Sussex</i> 
    made it seem certain that he would be forced into the war without a previous 
    agreement with the Allies that he should be allowed to dictate the peace, 
    Wilson had been in a state of extreme happiness. He had a new wife and he 
    had taken the world under his personal charge...As soon as the prospect of 
    becoming the PRINCE OF PEACE began to fade he grew intensely nervous and unhappy, 
    and indigestion and headaches began to harass him. He began to be irritated 
    by all of his associates, bored by his Cabinet, bored by the presidency. On 
    May 3, 1916, &quot;He declared that he did not desire to be President any 
    longer, and it would be a delightful relief if he could conscientiously retire.&quot; 
    The only living being who completely pleased him was Mrs. Wilson. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On June 16, 1916, he was renominated 
    unanimously by the Democrats and the slogan of his second campaign was...&quot;He 
    kept us out of war.&quot; Wilson, knowing that he had been doing his best 
    the previous eight months to get the American people into the war on his own 
    terms, had such a bad conscience that he avoided in his personal campaign 
    speeches all reference to the fact that he had kept the country out of war 
    and all promises to keep the country out of war in the future. Nevertheless, 
    he knew that he could not be elected without the votes of the Western states, 
    which were overwhelmingly against war. Therefore he sanctioned the use of 
    the slogan, &quot;He kept us out of war!&quot; by his party; and from thousands 
    of posters and thousands of throats the idea was driven into the American 
    people: Wilson kept us out of the war and he will keep us out of the war. 
    The vote for Wilson was a vote for peace. If the American people had known 
    that he had been attempting to get them into the war, he would have been overwhelmingly 
    defeated...</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And make straight paths for your Feet, lest that which 
    is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which 
    no man shall see the Lord:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of

    BE DEFILED...</font></i><font size="+1">(Hebrews 12:13-15; Daniel, chapter 
    4).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout the presidential campaign, 
    Wilson continued to be in a bad temper, and he loosed his nervous irritation 
    impartially on his friends and enemies...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson's mood had completely changed 
    since the day in 1915 when he had described the Germans as &quot;wild beasts.&quot; 
    </font><font size="2">(Jeremiah 15:1-3)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Because the Allies had refused to accept him as the SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD he 
    had begun to feel that they were nearly as great enemies of God as the Germans. 
    His wish to turn the war into a <i>crusade</i> which he might lead and his 
    growing belief that the Allies might be as infidel as the Germans were remarkably 
    juxtaposed in his speech of October 5, 1916, in which he said: &quot;The singularity 
    of the present war is that its origin and objects have never been disclosed...It 
    will take a long inquiry of history to explain this war. (continued)...</font></p>

    he had asked for a declaration of war. He could not ask about it except as 
    a crusade for peace. The facts conflicted most terribly with his desire. And, 
    in the manner which had become habitual to him, he escaped from his dilemma 
    by ignoring the facts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his war message he expressed 
    not his desire that the war should be a crusade but his belief that it was 
    a crusade, and forgot the facts. But the facts were still vivid in his mind 
    when Cobb talked to him, and to Cobb he expressed the facts. Thereafter he 
    did his best to suppress the unpleasant facts, and in large measure he succeeded. 
    The facts of war became to him not the actual facts but facts which he invented 
    to express his wishes. From time to time the actual facts rose out of suppression 
    and he drove them back by renewed assertions of the imaginary facts which 
    expressed his own desires. He was persuaded by his own words. He began to 
    believe utterly in his phrases. By his words he made many men in many lands 
    believe that the war would end in a just peace, and he made all America 'drunk 
    with the spirit of self-sacrifice;' but no man was more deceived or intoxicated

    to flower freely in the night when he wrote his war message and could not 
    face the facts. He announced that the war was a crusade, KNOWING WELL IN ONE 
    LOCKED CHAMBER OF HIS MIND THAT THE CRUSADERS WOULD NEVER REACH THE HOLY LAND 
    but believing in the rest of his mind, because he desired to believe, that

    WITH CHRIST was unquestionably the chief psychic force which made it so difficult 
    for him to make his decision; but an additional cause seems to have contributed 
    to his excessive uncertainty (about going to war). The scene in the Cabinet 
    Room of the White House after Wilson had delivered his war message to Congress 
    remained unexplained. Tumulty described it thus: 'For a while he sat in silence 
    and pale in the Cabinet Room. At last he said: Think what it was they were 
    applauding. My message today was a message of death for our young men. How 
    strange it seems to applaud that.'&quot; (pp.194,95)...</font></p>

    this world depended on our finite intelligence I should not know how to reason 
    my way to sanity, and I do not believe that there is a body of men however 
    they concert their power of their influence, that can defeat this great enterprise,

    not to risk something besides reputation--risk life and everything. WE KNEW

<p align="center"><font size="+1">PROPHECY IN OUR TIME</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">by Martin Ebon</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AUTHOR'S NOTE..The subject of this 
    book, prophecy in our time, is part of an area of long-standing interest to 
    the author: the psychology of public affairs. BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS PROPHECY? 
    How does its meaning compare to that of precognition, foreknowledge, forecasting, 
    anticipation, and related concepts? Prophecy, a highly subjective experience, 
    is too much in flux, too alive, for rigid catagorization<i><font size="+1">...</font></i>Taking 
    advantage of this freedom, I have included prophetic efforts in modern economics...because 
    forecasting techniques in this field are closer to traditional oracular methods 
    than is commonly realized...</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FREUD: OEDIPUS WITHOUT 
    ORACLE</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The scientific 
    study of prophetic claims has made halting but notable progress with the advancement 
    of psychology, notably in psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud, who so greatly widened 
    man's insight into his unconscious drives, was selective in his research and 
    ideas; nowhere is this more striking than in his major concept of the Oedipus 
    complex. Named after the legendary Greek King Oedipus, who killed his father 
    and married his mother, Freud's concept postulated that just about everyone 
    falls in love, at least briefly, with the parent of the opposite sex.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Examination of Sophocles' 
    play<i>Oedipus Rex</i> shows that Freud accepted one key idea from this ageless 
    tragedy but ignored the significance of another. He plucked the Oedipus complex 
    from the plot and dialogue, but shunted aside Sophocles' classic acceptance 
    of oracular prophecy...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles 
    of God...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Peter 4:11).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">And the king said unto them...I have a dreamed 
    a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 
    2:3) </font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel 
    in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</font></i></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the 
    name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</font></i></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">And he changeth the times and the seasons: 
    he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and 
    knowledge to them that know understanding:</font></i></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">He revealeth the deep and secret things: 
    he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him...</font></i><font size="+1">(Dan

    thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation 
    thereof?...</font></i><font size="+1">(Dan.2:26-47).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Freud<i><font size="+1"> 
    </font></i>could have noted the universal validity of Oedipus' predestined 
    fate, while recognizing the fundamental psychological implications that relate 
    man's longing to know the future, as dramatized in the play. In his </font><i><font size="+1">Interpretation 
    of Dreams</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, Freud wrote 
    that the play was 'known as a tragedy of destiny,' and that 'its tragic effect 
    is said to lie in the contrast between the supreme will of the gods and the 
    vain attempt of mankind to escape the evil that threatens them.' But to him 
    the play's impact on a modern audience, as on the ancient Greek one, 'does 
    not lie in the contrast between destiny and human will,' but in 'the particular 
    nature of the material on which the contrast is exemplified.'</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Freud, 
    we are moved by the fate of Oedipus 'only because it might have been ours--because 
    the oracle laid the same curse upon us before our birth as upon him.' And 
    he adds: 'It is the fate of all of us, perhaps, to direct our first sexual 
    impulse toward our mother </font><font size="2">(the Church)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    and our first hatred and our first murderous wish against our father <font size="2">(God)</font>. 
    Our dreams convince us that it is so.' Freud added that we outgrow these emotions 
    unless we are </font><i><font size="+1">psychoneuratic</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">; 
    for the mature audience watching <i>Oedipus</i>, 'these primal wishes of our 
    childhood have been fulfilled, and we shrink back from him with the whole 
    force of the repression by which those wishes have since that time been held 
    down within us.'</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In summarizing the 
    Sophocles play, Freud plays down the element of predestination but emphasizes 
    the love-of-mother and hatred-of-father themes. He does note that the Oracle 
    warned Oedipus' father, Laius, that the stillborn child would murder him. 
    In order to prevent the prophecy from coming true, the parents abandoned the 
    newborn baby in the mountains, presumable to die. The child was found, of 
    course, by a shepherd, who called him 'Oedipus' which means 'SWOLLEN FEET.'...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Freud picks up the 
    story when the rescued child, a grown prince at an alien court, wondering 
    about his origin, 'questioned the Oracle and was warned to avoid his home 
    since he was destined to murder his father and take his mother in marriage.' 
    Oedipus, believing the King and Queen of Corinth to be his parents, now flees 
    to Thebes. On the way, he quarrels with an old man and kills him...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">It is reported commonly that there is fornication 
    among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, 
    that one should have his father's wife...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Corinthians 
    5:1). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of the wide 
    attention that Freud's concept of the 'Oedipus complex' has attracted in popular 
    psychology, the implications of Sophocles' sequel to the play has been largely 
    ignored...In it the aged Oedipus returns to Attica, accompanied by one of 
    his daughters, at peace with himself but in rebellion against fate. AS HE 
    HAD NEVER KNOWN THAT LAIUS AND JOCASTA WERE HIS NATURAL PARENTS, DESTINY HAD 
    VIRTUALLY TRICKED HIM INTO HIS ACTIONS, and into the partial self-destruction 
    he committed by blinding himself. Oedipus at the end of his life's journey, 
    turns with contempt on those who took advantage of his misfortune. He acts 
    out yet another oracular prophecy by going serenely to an all-forgiving death--a 
    man purged of whatever curse he may have suffered, cleansed of the guilt that 
    was never his. In the concluding scene of the play, Oedipus is freed of his 
    'complex' by following a predestined fate that is no longer tragic, but that 
    of a man sure of his essential purity and worth...Oedipus comes to terms with 
    his own fate in this soliloquy:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>&quot;...The bloody deaths, the incest, the calamities You speak so glibly 
      of: I suffered them, by fate against my will! It was God's pleasure, and 
      perhaps our race has angered him long ago. In me myself you could not find 
      such evil as would have made me sin against my own.</p>
    <p>And tell me this: if there were prophecies repeated by the oracles of the 
      gods, that Father's death should come through his own son, how could you 
      justly blame it on me? On me, who was yet unborn, yet unconceived, not yet 
      existent for my father and mother?</p>
    <p>If then I came into the world--as I did come--in wretchedness, AND MET 
      MY FATHER IN FIGHT, AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN, NOT KNOWING THAT I KILLED HIM, 
      NOR WHOM I KILLED--again how could you find guilt in that unmeditated act?&quot;</p>

  Thomas Woodrow Wilson to be the <i>First king</i> of modern Grecia (Egypt, Assyria,

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Preparing for death Oedipus settles 
    in the groves of the Furies, at Colonus, about a mile northwest of Athens. 
    Eagerly he awaits word from the Oracle of Apollo. He welcomes his daughter 
    Ismene...and questions her to find out whether the gods are 'concerned with 
    my deliverance.' Ismene assures him, 'I have, father, the latest sentence 
    of the Oracle.' Oedipus asks, 'HOW ARE THEY WORDED? WHAT DO THEY PROPHESY?' 
    She replies, 'That you shall be much solicited by our people. Before your 
    death--and after--for their welfare.' And further: 'The oracles declare their 
    strength's in you...For the gods who threw you down sustain you now...'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly, these passages indicate 
    a concern for the continuing theme or oracular power, the impact of destiny 
    on man. Freud sought out and found the Oedipal tragedy in the work of Sophocles, 
    but ignored its dramatization of the psychological dynamics underlying man's 
    search of prophetic assurance, the desire to know, conquer, and possibly control 
    a seemingly inevitable fate...The Oracle's roles in the Oedipus legend correspond 
    to human concern with future destiny, strong in man's emotions, in his daily 
    existence as well as in his apparent premonitory dreams. (Acts 2:16-21). At 
    times, such dreams have a multiple impact: they not only picture events that 
    seem to come true later on in defiance of orderly chronological concepts, 
    but they may also reflect emotional states that bring about the events; the 
    very strength of the dream experience may help to pave the way for these events. 
    Freud never got around to studying closely, much less accepting, a number 
    of psychological implications of </font><i><font size="+1">Oedipus at Colonus</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>, 
    </i>but some of those who build their own ideas on the foundation of Freudian 
    concepts, have done daring and fascinating research in precognition as well 
    as in telepathy...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With all this going on the last 
    thing Freud needed was involvement with 'occult matters such as telepathy 
    or, worse still, prophecy. But he was being pushed and pulled on these subjects 
    as on so many others...Freud was being badgered IN VIENNA by his brilliant 
    and eccentric disciple, Sandor Ferenczi, to acknowledge psychic phenomena. 
    And Freud's 1912 split with C.G.Jung was partly over the issue of the 'occult,' 
    for which Freud expressed extreme aversion, but which Jung regarded as a fitting 
    subject for exploration in the development of his own 'open system' of analytical 
    psychology...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wish to know the future is 
    alive in man today, as it has been since prehistoric times. It has a strong, 
    basic emotional appeal. Certainly, an issue so old and fundamental cannot 
    be cast aside by schools of psychology that seek to explore, understand, diagnose, 
    heal, and guide modern man...&quot; (pp.85-87).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Jung regarded some premonitions 
    as remnants of the child's world. In </font><i><font size="+1">The Significance 
    of the Father in the Destiny of the Individual</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    he stated in 1908 that as the mind matures, parental influences fade into 
    the unconscious, but that out of this reservoir 'the infantile situation still 
    sends up dim, premonitory feelings, feelings of being secretly guided by other-worldly 
    influences,' just as 'the power which forces the bird to migrate is not produced 
    by the bird itself, but derives from its ancestors.'...He says that there 
    exists 'the possibility of a natural or absolute knowledge, when the unconscious 
    psyche coincides with objective facts </font>(with both natural and spiritual 
    reality)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jung's investigations led him to 
    the conclusion that beyond the world of the psyche, with its causal manifestations 
    in time and space, there must lie a 'transpsychic reality' where time and 
    space are no longer of absolute but relative validity; what the psyche experiences 
    as past, present and future merges 'there into an unknowable unity of timelessness, 
    and what appears to consciousness as near and far combines 'there' into a 
    likewise unknowable spacelessness. And that, for the time being, is the most 
    authoritive summary of Jung's search for the reality of prophecy in our lives--his 
    and ours.&quot; (pp.94-102). </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE NEOCONS AND WOODROW 
  WILSON</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By PHILIP GOLD</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    Sunday, May 11, 2003. I know from neocons. Midge Decter, the movement's grande 
    dame, introduced me to journalism in 1981. She and neocon&quot;godfather&quot; 
    Irving Kristol helped get me the grant for my first book. Throughout the '80s 
    and much of the '90s, while living in Washington, D.C., I worked with neocons, 
    wrote for them, attended their conferences, appeared with them on panels and 
    occasionally drank their whiskey. I still read their stuff and, for the most 
    part, I like them as people. But I also know that, in three critical ways, 
    Joshua Muravchik's description elides some unflattering truths.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, neoconservatism is a multigenerational 
    movement that has never really been conservative or fully accepted by the 
    mainstream, let alone the fringes. At its best, it was a valuable aberration. 
    Today, it's maligned. Second, although the younger neocons, the Boom X generation, 
    are Republicans, THEY DRAW THEIR DEEPEST SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION FROM WOODROW 
    WILSON. That's a dangerous liaison. And third, there's the matter of neocon 
    &quot;influence&quot; -- an issue that, sadly, cannot be divorced from the 
    tawdry subject of anti-Semitism and its present real and/or alleged reinvigoration. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEOCONSERVATISM, as Muravchik notes, 
    AROSE IN THE 70s AS A REACTION TO THE 60s. IT WAS AT FIRST A NEW YORK PHENOMENON 
    AND MOSTLY, though far from entirely, JEWISH. It reflected the sensibilities 
    of a unique generation of intellectuals, often starting out as the poor children 
    of immigrants, who made the long march from Brooklyn and City College of New 
    York and FDR for some and Trotsky for others, to that literary section of 
    Manhattan where they take their politics and their cocktail parties -- and 
    their book reviews -- very, very seriously. These were people of ideas, always 
    articulate and often brilliant, who'd also known depression, war, discrimination 
    and lives of unrelenting effort. They had struggled and succeeded. They were, 
    in short, full dues-paying members of the Greatest Generation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And neoconservatism was as much 
    their personal journey, their midlife crisis, as a political movement. Irving 
    Kristol, a founder of &quot;The Public Interest,&quot; and Norman Podhoretz, 
    former editor of &quot;Commentary&quot; and author of &quot;Making It,&quot; 
    have written movingly of this. THEIR BREAK WITH THE LEFT WAS PAINFUL AND COMPLEX, 
    BOTH A FAREWELL TO THEIR OWN GENERATION AND A REPUDIATION OF THE 1960s NEW 
    LEFT EXCESSES that their former friends' children had wrought. The children 
    they chided for their tantrums and immaturity, the parents for their excessive 
    tolerance and flaccidity in the face of barbarisms both foreign and domestic.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Midge Decter's &quot;Liberal Parents, 
    Radical Children&quot; can still be read with profit here. Indeed, many saw 
    liberalism's greatest failure AS A MATTER OF &quot;WILL&quot; AND &quot;NERVE,&quot; 
    two favorite neocon value-words, especially when dealing with communists and 
    kids. AND WHEN THEY TOOK UP RONALD (WILSON) REAGAN, it was his steady anti-communism 
    that they found most attractive. All in all, they were the right people at 
    the right time. THEY HELPED FASHION THE &quot;WILL&quot; AND THE &quot;NERVE&quot; 
    THAT BROUGHT THE SOVIETS DOWN. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nor are their children lacking 
    in will, certainly not in the chicken hawk sense -- an unfair epithet, but 
    not entirely inapt, APPLIED TO THOSE WHO URGE WAR and pander to bellicosity 
    BUT NEVER SERVED, OR WILL SERVE, THEMSELVES. What they are lacking is their 
    parents' depth and life experiences. And perhaps it is not too much to suggest 
    that the current leadership of the movement shows more than a trace of the 
    arrogance imputed to Boomer and Generation X left radicals, and of the infatuation 
    with their own theories that only those who've never been smacked upside the 
    head by reality (poverty, unfriendly fire, hard bigotry) can indulge. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What theories? Today, the Boomer/Generation 
    X neocons invoke icons of steadfastness such as Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan, 
    even Winston Churchill. But neocon writer and former Wall Street Journal editor 
    Max Boot caught it best some months ago WHEN HE DESCRIBED THEIR PREFERRED 
    FOREIGN POLICY AS &quot;HARD WILSONIANISM&quot;-- making the world safe for 
    democracy, THIS TIME WITH THE WILL AND THE NERVE AND THE POWER TO MAKE IT 
    STICK. Whatever else this may be, it is not conservatism, which holds these 
    truths to be self-evident: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">History does not begin anew with 
    us. We cannot force people to be free. Evil is real and, therefore, best we 
    take a modest, exceedingly modest, view of our ability to change human nature. 
    And speaking of human nature, power corrupts. It corrupts those who wield 
    it. And it corrupts those who seek to influence those who wield it. WHEN WOODROW 
    WILSON SAILED FOR THE VERSAILLES PEACE CONFERENCE IN 1919, HE TOOK WITH HIM 
    A TRAVELIING THINK TANK KNOWN AS &quot;THE INQUIRY.&quot; He exhorted these 
    young intellectuals, some of whom wrote for and most of whom read The New 
    Republic: &quot;TELL ME WHAT'S RIGHT AND I WILL FIGHT FOR IT!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WE'RE STILL TRYING TO CLEAN UP 
    THE MESS THOSE INTELLECTUALS MADE. And in some ways, from &quot;The New Republic&quot; 
    then to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; now, not that much of a change. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which brings us to the subject 
    of influence. Muravchik is right. Some of President Bush's policies &quot;resemble 
    things advocated by neocons,&quot; but &quot;Who knows how Bush decides?&quot; 
    (Does Bush always know?) And anyway, as Midge Decter wisely warned me, influence 
    can never be claimed. It can only be bestowed by those who are influenced. 
    What is bestowed can be taken away. Even the appearance of influence can lead 
    to an unpleasant backlash. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if you're Jewish, and high-visibility, 
    and associated with controversial policies and perilous actions, if your name 
    is Kristol (Irving or son Bill) or Podhoretz (Norman or son John) or Kagan 
    or Perle or Wolfowitz or Frum, backlash can get ugly. Is this happening? It's 
    hard to say. It's expected that the Arab press would run articles headlined, 
    &quot;PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF NEOCON.&quot; It's not surprising when neocons 
    such as David Brooks complain in print about anti-Semitic e-mails and phone 
    messages. It's business-as-usual when segments of the far right and the farther 
    left find themselves accused of bigotry masquerading as anti-Zionism, or anti-neoconism. 
    But it's something else entirely to hear, as I have, military officers speak 
    openly and contemptuously of &quot;the Likudniks in the E-Ring&quot; (Likud 
    being Ariel Sharon's party, the E-Ring the Pentagon corridor where the senior 
    leadership hangs out). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it's scary to realize that 
    the United States has undertaken to remake the Islamic world in our own image 
    and to our own satisfaction, by military conquest and occupation and the making 
    of examples, in order to encourage the others. And harder still to know that 
    the most prominent advocates of THIS NEW WILSONIAN IMPERIALISM are a small 
    group of public intellectuals with no significant political or cultural base 
    and scant knowledge of the nation beyond the Beltway or the world beyond their 
    abstractions. And it would be tragic, were a movement that did some good once, 
    to be remembered -- mostly for its part in marching the nation toward folly.</font></p>
