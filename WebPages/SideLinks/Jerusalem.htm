<p align="center">THE GENESIS AND GEOMETRY OF THE LABYRINTH,</p>
<p align="center">ARCHITECTURE, HIDDEN LANGUAGE, MYTHS, AND RITUALS</p>
<p align="center">by Patrick Conty</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Labyrinthh2.jpg" width="250" height="248"></p>
<p align="center">THE ENIGMA</p>
<p align="left">The story of how Ariadne fell in love with the brave and daring 
  Theseus is well known. Betraying her father, King Minos, and her half-brother, 
  the Minotaur, Ariadne gave Theseus a ball of thread that unwound before him, 
  showing him the way through THE LABYRINTH built by Daedalus to imprison the 
  Minotaur. (Half man, half Taurus). Thus equipped, Theseus escaped from the inextricable 
  labyrinth, and after having killed the Minotaur and liberated his companions, 
  he set sail for Athens with Ariadne, whom, for reasons that remain obscure, 
  he abandoned along the way on the island of Naxos.</p>
<p align="left">The myth presents us, as it did Theseus, with a specific problem: 
  HOW TO FIND THE PATH FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE CENTER OF THE MAZE. Theseus certainly 
  did not just let the thread unroll behind him as he advanced...Rather he used 
  the thread to find the center. The task is linked to a geometric and topological 
  problem epitomized by the GORDIAN KNOT , which had to be unraveled without one's 
  knowing the location of the ends of the rope.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Knot.gif" width="249" height="248"></p>
<p align="left">Gordius, legendary king of Phyrigia, used this knot to attach 
  a yoke TO THE SHAFT OF HIS CHARIOT. It was later preserved in Zeus's temple 
  at Gordium. THE LEGEND HELD THAT WHOEVER COULD UNTIE THE KNOT WOULD BECOME MASTER 
  OF THE WORLD. Alexander the Great, FAR TOO IMPATIENT FOR THIS ENDEAVOR, cut 
  it in half with his sword.</p>
<p align="left">If the rope of the Gordian knot were untied <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(figured 
  out)</font> and rolled into a ball to avoid its getting tangled, would it not 
  be similar to Ariadne's ball of thread? It could then be seen as representing 
  the complex path of the rope in the knot, at once untangled and arranged in 
  a new manner, BUT AS IF PRESERVED IN MEMORY. The image of the ball of thread 
  that indicates the way as it unwinds can also be seen as a backward projection 
  of a film capturing the movement of the knot being unraveled and of the rope 
  being progressively rolled into a ball. Ariadne's thread seems to be a subtle 
  link between two similar topological problems.</p>
<p align="left">Even though the quest for a solution should be less burdensome 
  for us than it was for Theseus, SEEING THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE TO FEAR A CONFRONTATION 
  WITH THE MINOTAUR (?...continued)...</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><b>There is, however, the Behemoth (Job 40:15-24, KJV). <font size="2">The 
    author, Patrick Conty, lives in the south of France, and therefore might appreciate 
    ( in his own quietly spiritual and intellectual way) the connection that exists 
    between his statement about the Minotaur and the actual conflict that is being 
    waged in the earth at this present time, not only between the majority of 
    the French people (as well as others all throughout the earth) and the American 
    government over the issue of War in the Middle East, but between the millions 
    who are rising up inside America, against the great Beast, over the issue 
    of WAR itself. But more than this, the conflict shall soon revert to the question, 
    or rather the meaning, of history, and then to the very meaning of LIFE itself 
    and our connection to all that is Divine in the world. </font></b></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="2">We have included the entire first chapter 
    of Patrick Conty's deeply insightful, inquisitive and timely work here, for 
    the very simple reason that it is &quot;timely.&quot; It brings all of us 
    to the very threshold of our present human dilemma. It places the human quest 
    in its proper historical and spiritual perspective, and poses on behalf of 
    all of us all of the necessary questions. The author has heard the voice of 
    the Spirit Herself saying &quot;Ask, seek, knock,&quot; so that She Herself 
    can provide the answers. Without the proper questions the Universe finds no 
    means to provide the answers. The mystery of the Labyrinth? It is indeed the 
    way to Jerusalem. It is the way to Eternal Life itself.</font></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">(continued)...the problem seems nonetheless impossible to solve, 
  since no one agrees about what the labyrinth really was or where it was located. 
  Some suggest that it was the palace of Knossos itself, BUILT AS A REPLICA OF 
  THE FAMOUS EGYPTIAN LABYRINTH that disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p align="left">Others state that it refers to neighboring quarries, or to those 
  of Crotone, in Calabria. Still others suggest that the myth corresponds to a 
  ritual that is represented in one of the frescoes in the palace of Knossis that 
  represents a bullfighting game. According to Herbinger, this fresco can be interpreted 
  as a ritual calendar in which the circles in the border represent the Lunar 
  months...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/TwelveLunarMonths.gif" width="550" height="400"></p>
<p align="left">...There are a multitude of mazes, labyrinths, and drawings depicting 
  them from all over the world, BUT THEIR SOLUTIONS ARE TOO OBVIOUS OR TOO SIMPLE 
  TO ENTIRELY JUSTIFY THE <i>INESCAPABLE</i> CHARACTER OF THE LABYRINTH REFERRED 
  TO IN THE MYTH...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Labyrinth.gif" width="400" height="550"></p>
<p align="center"><b>A Journey to the Center, to Tiphereth.</b></p>
<p align="left">Any sinuous path, any fortress or fortified enclosure, can eventually 
  represent or evoke a labyrinth. When its angles are rounded, the (path) can 
  also take on the form of A SERIES OF WAVES THAT REPRESENT THE SEA OR THE ELEMENT 
  OF WATER AND THUS, BY EXTENSION, ALL OF LIFE. Without being able to formulate 
  the problem we are confronted with explicitly, it is difficult, if not impossible, 
  to find a strategy capable of bringing us nearer to a solution.</p>
<p align="left">Could we then see the labyrinth in the same way as Kafka's castle 
  or court? Should we see it as a simple metaphor or as a way of evoking those 
  <i>things that never happened but always are</i>? Does this mean that the myth 
  is speaking to us about <i>Being</i>?</p>
<p align="left">In any case, the myths and legends in which all civilizations 
  since the beginning of history have presented different versions of the labyrinth 
  raise this question: WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE MYTH? Here again, a precise 
  answer is difficult to formulate, as many myths present different versions, 
  each one offering many different possibilities for interpretation. Like Proteus, 
  the labyrinth eludes all attempts to lay hold of it by constantly presenting 
  itself in new forms. Where the Greek myth presents the labyrinth as a prison 
  from which escape is impossible, the <i>Aeneid</i> suggests THAT IT HIDES THE 
  ENTRANCE TO HADES.</p>
<p align="left">The Mahabharata describes it as a lethal formation used in the 
  Battle of Kurukshetra, but in the Ramayana it is an impregnable fortified castle, 
  lair of the (Ten Headed) demon Ravana. (Revelation 12:3; 13:1). In tantric art 
  the labyrinth is a yantra symbolizing <i>citta</i>, or the mind. The Native 
  Americans see it as the point of emergence and path along which their distant 
  ancestors entered this world. In certain parts of Africa the labyrinth takes 
  the form of a strategic duel. FOR MEDIEVAL MAN IT IS THE ROAD TO JERUSALEM, 
  THE PATH THAT LED THE PILGRIM TO A TOTAL REORIENTATION. But it can also represent 
  the the siege and storming of Troy, and for the Jews it represented the capture 
  of Jericho. In each case, the meaning given to the labyrinth is different <font size="2">(but 
  not really)</font>, which makes for great flexibility in its interpretation. 
  THIS VARIETY CAN INDICATE THAT THE LABYRINTH'S ORIGINAL OR FUNDAMENTAL SIGNIFICANCE 
  IS EITHER LOST OR VERY BROAD. Thus the ancient Egyptian labyrinth located near 
  Lake Moeris was known to be A SORT OF MATRIX, reflecting the structure of the 
  universe...</p>
<p align="left">In Korea, there is a labyrinth called the Ocean Seal, conceived 
  by the first patriarch of Hua-yen Buddhism to contain a fundamental metaphysical 
  text, called THE <i>ROUND </i>OR <i>ALL-EMBRACING</i> VIEW, and whose profound 
  meaning it seems to reflect. Finally, the very ancient Tihuanaco calendar, like 
  the one at Knossos...seems to link the structure of the labyrinth TO THE PASSAGE 
  OF TIME....Kerenyi concludes by saying that the labyrinth must remain a <i>mystery</i>, 
  which seems more than a bit evasive! If we can legitimately suppose that the 
  labyrinth is connected to ancient mysteries, it remains to be seen how this 
  is so, AND TO WHICH MYSTERIES?.</p>
<p align="left">In fact interpretations of the labyrinth do exist. <font size="2">(continued)</font>...</p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">Jill Purce, in her work entitled The Mystic Spiral, 
  say</font>s:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The earliest known labyrinth 
    is that dating from the 19th century B.C. in Egypt; the most famous was in 
    Minoan Crete. These, and some of the earliest spiral rock engravings from 
    Paleolithic times, are reminders of man's increasing preoccupation with the 
    spiral order and his own spiral development.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the labyrinth creates and dissolves, 
    expands and contracts, so it reveals and conceals, It is cosmos to those who 
    know the way, and chaos to those who lose it. It is Ariadne's thread, whose 
    windings create the world and yet enables us to unravel it...</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>I give unto you the end of the Golden String,</b></p>
    <p><b>Only wind it in a ball,</b></p>
    <p><b>It will lead you in at Heaven's Gate</b></p>
    <p><b>Built in Jerusalem's Wall. <font size="2">William Blake, Jerusalem</font>.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point or centre, in those labyrinths 
    depicted in the pavement floors of many medieval cathedrals, is sometimes 
    a depiction of Theseus and the Minotaur. The symbolism is that of the original 
    Cretan--an initiatory hero test, the overcoming of death at the center, and 
    a subsequent return or rebirth into life. For, as it is necessary to be born 
    from the womb to see this world, only he who is born from himself sees the 
    other world. &quot;He who is not twice born will not ascend to the Kingdom 
    of Heaven.&quot; Other cathedral labyrinths depict the architect at the center, 
    sometimes symbolized in the person of Daedalus, the builder of the Cretan 
    maze. Since treading the maze was a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in miniature, 
    Daedalus also represents the Divine Architect. <font size="2">The Mystic Spiral, 
    p.29</font>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">(Patrick Conty continued)</font>...but as we shall 
  see, they do not solve the problem mentioned Kerenyi. WESTERN TRADITION GENERALLY 
  REPRESENTS THE LABYRINTH AS A WORLD THAT HOLDS US CAPTIVE, WITH ARIADNE'S THREAD 
  BEING THE SYMBOL OF LIBERATION. If this liberation is that promised by all religions, 
  the key to attaining it is found precisely in the ancient mysteries. The image 
  of the labyrinth seems to echo the question--&quot;Where are you?&quot;--that 
  God asked Adam after he had committed the transgression that excluded him for 
  Paradise. Here again, in yet another form, we are faced WITH A COMPLEX TOPOLOGICAL 
  SITUATION (<i>topos</i> in Greek means &quot;place&quot; or &quot;location&quot;). 
  If the labyrinth is the path of all seeking, it must also hold the answer to 
  the Sphinx's questions: &quot;WHO ARE YOU? WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? WHERE ARE 
  YOU GOING?&quot; Or to the <i>Quo vadis</i> heard by Paul on the road to Damascus. 
  But it can also become the symbol for the center of the primordial castle spoken 
  of by mystics AND KNOWN AS THE HOME OF THE SPIRIT, such as that described by 
  Meister Eckhart: &quot;There is within the soul a fortified castle where even 
  God's eye, in its three manifestations, cannot penetrate because it is the abode 
  of pure unity.&quot; This notion of an impregnable castle seems to contradict 
  that of an inescapable prison, BUT WHEN THE PATH LEADING OUT OF THE LABYRINTH 
  APPEARS, IT NEED ONLY BE REVERSED TO BECOME THE PATH LEADING FROM THE EXIT TO 
  THE CENTER. TO FIND THE PATH LEADING TO LIBERATION ONE MUST HAVE ALREADY TRAVELED 
  THE PATH LEADING TO THE CENTER, SYMBOL OF PURE UNITY, FOR IT IS ONLY THIS KNOWLEDGE 
  THAT IS CAPABALE OF BRINGING ABOUT FINAL LIBERATION. In other words: &quot;Everything 
  that appears to be <i>without</i> is in fact <i>within</i>.&quot; ...</p>
<p align="left">The traditional Western interpretation applies to medieval labyrinths, 
  THOSE CALLED THE ROAD TO JERUSALEM<i>, </i>which were laid into the floors of 
  churches and basilicas. JERUSALEM HERE DESIGNATES THE CELESTIAL CITY--THAT IS, 
  PARADISE RECOVERED.</p>
<p align="left">If not suspect, the interpretation is at least incomplete. It 
  presents a single meaning for a poly-semous myth that offers a constellation 
  of interwoven meanings. <font size="2">(continued)</font>...</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The quest for an earthly 
    Paradise is one of the oldest and most enduring themes of mythology. Ancient 
    clay tablets dating back to the 2nd millennium B.C. tell of the hero Gilgamesh 
    and his epic journey to the Garden of the Sun in search of the secrets of 
    immortality. In the 2nd century B.C. the Chinese emperor Wu Ti sent envoys 
    looking for the mythical palace of Hsi Wang Mu--the dwelling place of the 
    immortals, hidden in the mysterious Kunlun Mountains of Central Asia. During 
    the Middle Ages Irish monks set out on the Atlantic, seeking legendary isles 
    of the Blessed where they might find salvation. Centuries later the Pilgrims 
    crossed the ocean, hoping to find a Garden of Eden in the new world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tibetans have long held a tradition 
    of just such an earthly Paradise, called Shambhala--a mythical kingdom that 
    is hidden among the Snow mountains north of Tibet. (Snow, a six-stemmed crystal 
    is another symbol of that hidden place named Beauty on the Tree of Life). 
    There in the sanctuary free from strife and want, a line of divine kings is 
    said to be preserving the highest teachings of Buddhism for a time in the 
    future when barbarians will destroy all true religion in the world outside. 
    When the barbarians try to conquer even Shambhala, a Saviour king will emerge 
    with a supernatural army to defeat them in great battle and establish a golden 
    age throughout the world.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Buddhist prayer: &quot;MAY I 
    QUICKLY TAKE BIRTH IN SHAMBHALA, THE TREASURY OF JEWELS, AND COMPLETE THE 
    STAGES OF THE HIGHEST YOGA TANTRA.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2">(continued)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font>In 
  this medieval tradition one of the many implicit meanings of the myth becomes 
  explicit, and thus finds itself separated from its context in order to justify 
  the dogmas and mysteries of the Christian faith. Ariadne's thread becomes simply 
  a symbol of grace or even the string of a rosary. But we shall never understand 
  the importance of the thread or how it is supposed to guide the pilgrim. The 
  concrete topological problem of the myth--how to get out of the maze--fades 
  and becomes unsolvable. The relationship between geometry and metaphysics remains 
  obscure.</p>
<p align="left">The exegetical method used by the Western tradition to interpret 
  the myth is in itself mysterious and obscure, AS IT SPRINGS FROM AN INTIMATE 
  CONTACT WITH A REVELATION THAT TRANSMITS, OR RATHER TRANSLATES OR TRANSPOSES, 
  AN OLD MESSAGE INTO A NEW CONTEXT. This revelation can be achieved from arduous 
  studies, but it can also be the fruit of uncommon experiences, accidents, or 
  a destiny or pathway that more often than not can only be described in singularly 
  subjective terms. This destiny is precisely one of the themes interwoven with 
  that of the labyrinth in Jorge Luis Borge's short stories. We can also find 
  it in one of the inscriptions that accompanies a labyrinth from the Renaissance, 
  <i>FATA VIAM INVENIENT</i>, &quot;All destinies find their path.&quot; As it 
  reveals itself, the meaning of the labyrinth is transformed, taking on yet another 
  disguise.</p>
<p align="left">Yet by the very fact that these images handed down from tradition 
  are incomplete and yet explicit, they speak to us more directly than the myth. 
  Sometimes, when we try to think about our life AND TO UNDERSTAND ITS ULTIMATE 
  MEANING, it does effectively seem to stretch before us devoid of all purpose, 
  to follow a somewhat random path across a tangle of other paths, with all of 
  them leading nowhere. And when we try to avoid dead ends, to find an exit or 
  a reason for living, to get to the bottom of it or to establish a more satisfying 
  itinerary, we find only new twists and loops in a Gordian knot; the more we 
  struggle, the more it seems to confine us. IF FINALLY, WE RECOGNIZE THE PAST, 
  LIKE OUR REFLECTION IN A MIRROR, we discover a sort of Minotaur staring back 
  at us, half man, half beast. <font size="2">(Please consider Ecclesiastes 3:16-21)</font>. 
  And so, if we tend to drift, to go around in circles, to follow goals that ultimately 
  lead us away from our most essential desire, to which no compass can direct 
  us, we can easily suspect that we are living, like the character in Robert Pirsig's 
  <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, an inextricable maze...</p>
<p align="left">It is remarkable that in our age, when the idea of the Fates unwinding 
  the thread of our destiny seems old-fashioned and makes us smile, THE LABYRINTH 
  IS STILL LIKENED TO THE PROBLEM OF THE MEANING OF OUR EXISTENCE and even haunts 
  our consciousness with renewed vigor as a symbol of a quest that has become 
  ever more obscure. The most subtle writers of our time, Kafka, Joyce, Roussel, 
  Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Eco, have all found in the maze an effective image to 
  represent our world, and have each proposed his own version, which he presents 
  as a castle, a court, the city of Dublin, an immense library, a secret garden,or 
  even a strategy. Perhaps this can be attributed to the fact that with the arrival 
  of the scientific revolution, language itself has become a kind of maze:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;The social subject itself seems to dissolve in this dissemination of 
    language games. The social bond is linguistic, but it is not woven with a 
    single thread. It is a fabric formed the intersection of at least two (and 
    in reality an indeterminate number of) language games, obeying different rules. 
    Wittgenstein writes: 'Our language can be seen as an ancient city; a maze 
    of little streets and squares, of old and new houses with additions from recent 
    periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight 
    streets and uniform houses.'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scientists themselves use these images to describe the inconclusive or indeterminate 
  character of knowledge that modern science leads to. Rudy Rucker gives us an 
  example when he describes Godel's incompleteness theorem: &quot;Mathematicians 
  can never formulate a correct and complete description of the set of ordinary 
  whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3 . . .). They are thus left like Kafka's K. in <i>the 
  Castle, </i>unable to escape from the imprisoning passageways. Endlessly they 
  hurry up and down corridors, meeting people, knocking on doors, conducting their 
  investigations. But nowhere in the castle of science is there a final exit onto 
  absolute truth.</p>
<p>Even the new scientific method, which seemed to have cleared A STRAIGHT PATH, 
  is now described as a labyrinth:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;It is now less a path than a multitude of tracks, a map: the labyrinthine 
    forest of the intellectual's wanderings...The scientific problem is an interrogation 
    of intersubjectivity...It is enclosed within the complex graph of the encyclopedic 
    labyrinth. So that if the labyrinth itself torments and is problematical, 
    in and of itself and by the complication of its intersections, it is nonetheless 
    both causing the problems and solving them precisely by the very power of 
    its intersections. The object of science grows, correlatively in power, and 
    its problems in generalities. The scientific problem raises itself suddenly 
    to universalizing dignities, recognized of late, by the philosophical questions: 
    less the facing of an obstacle than the confrontation of a community to a 
    global complication that concerns it and that it concerns.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when we speak about a labyrinth today, are we trying to analyze or chart 
  a structure in order to find an exit or a center, or is it more in order to 
  survive within it and adapt like intelligent laboratory rats? Today, Ariadne's 
  thread is ignored, and it seems that only the negative aspect of the labyrinth 
  has been maintained. AS FOR ITS POSITIVE ASPECTS, WHICH EVOKES A FINAL LIBERATION, 
  a threshold, a chiasmus WHERE A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION IS BROUGHT ABOUT, or 
  a <i>metamorphosis</i>...it remains suspicious and foreign. This positive aspect 
  lives on at most as a truth of historical value, a possibility that departed 
  with the gods, a secret that must remain shut away, like the Minotaur, in the 
  domain of the fantastic. It is as if reality, like the lowlands of Holland, 
  needed a carefully maintained dike to protect it against the myth.</p>
<p>Like the protagonists of <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, the man who enters the modern 
  labyrinth has resigned himself to endure and to adapt to his new environment. 
  Or else, taking the opposite stance, he is resolved, come what may, to sever 
  the Gordian knot. Modern man can identify himself with Daedalus: He admires 
  a <i>cunning craftsman</i> who advocates artificial intelligence and genetic 
  engineering, but who seems little concerned with assuming responsibility for 
  his inventions. He can identify himself with the Minotaur, also called Asterius, 
  The Man Marked With a Star, but much less so with Theseus, whom he converts 
  to Don Quixote. HE HAS ABANDONED THE SEARCH FOR THE CENTER AND AN EXIT AND GIVEN 
  UP THE CONQUEST OF DEATH, so that instead of being opposed to birth it has become 
  opposed to Life, thereby determining its absurd meaning. He follows Heidegger's 
  &quot;paths leading nowhere: without even understanding what this nowhere might 
  mean. As Borges has pointed out in his book <i>Labyrinths</i>,&quot;it is absurd 
  that such a long corridor should lead to such a small room.&quot;...</p>

    stands the house where Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote his opera &quot;Cosi 
    fan tutte&quot;, with Lorenzo da Ponte, his librettist, who was the son of 
    a Jewish craftsman from Venetia, coming to see him frequently in house number 
    four.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, on Vienna's Judenplatz Square, 
    many Jews gathered for their common prayers, as early as the late Middle Ages. 
    However, we also find here evidence for many centuries of hatred against the 
    local Jewish population. We are standing now on the foundations of that synagogue 
    where, more than 500 years ago, the repeatedly flaring phases of expulsion, 
    persecution and killings of Jews in Vienna culminated in their desperate act 
    of self-conflagration. And we come to realize that - here again - THERE IS 
    A LONG CHAIN OF INTERACTION AND INVOLVEMENT WHICH WE MUST ACCEPT, IN SORROW 
    AND WITH HUMILITY, AS PART OF OUR HISTORY, AND WHICH RUNS THROUGH THE CENTURIES 
    LIKE A STIGMA. </font>(Like a Stigmata)?<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    However, we must KNOW in order to be able to ACKNOWLEDGE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, on Vienna's Judenplatz Square, 
    you also see a statue of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, the German poet, whose 
    &quot;Ring Parable&quot; has remained alive to this day, as a forceful symbol 
    for tolerance. For us, a plea attaches to his person, namely that - time and 
    again - we must find the strength to actively and courageously stand up for 
    tolerance and to accept those who are different and are strangers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, on Judenplatz Square, finally, 
    we will unveil a memorial today, which is dedicated TO THOSE AUSTRIAN JEWS 
    WHO BECAME THE VICTIMS OF THE GREATEST INHUMANITY OF THE PAST CENTURY. If 
    I use the expression inhumanity this is, in fact, not correct. After all, 
    human beings devised, planned and consistently implemented this virtually 
    industrial extermination of millions of their fellow men and women. There 
    were many Austrians among those who let the flame of hatred burn so high in 
    their hearts as only human beings are capable of admitting. And they were 
    human beings &#150; acquaintances, colleagues, neighbours, or even friends 
    who were prepared, or had been moved, for the most diverse motives, TO TAKE 
    PART IN THE GREATEST CRIME THAT HAS EVER BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST THE JEWISH 
    PEOPLE: THE SHOA.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><font size="+1">And the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of 
      the City, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads 
      of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the 
      midst thereof.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">And to others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him 
      through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, 
      and women, but come not near any upon whom is the mark; AND BEGIN AT MY 
      SANCTUARY. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ezekiel 
      9:4-7). </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we have come here today to unveil 
    the memorial that Rachel Whiteread, the British artist, has designed and which 
    seems fit - like no other monument - to describe that which cannot be described, 
    then we must also admit that many Austrians share in the blame of having committed 
    the crimes of the Nazi regime. And we must also insist and demand anew THAT 
    WE MUST REJECT AND FIGHT AGAINST ANY FIRST SIGN OF ANTI-SEMITISM AND RACISM 
    IN AUSTRIA TODAY. There is no way around it, nor any looking to the side. 
    There must be no compromise, nor concession.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same holds true when addressing 
    the question of returning expropriated belongings to deportees or their descendants, 
    or of finding the best possible way to compensate them for the injustices 
    that they have suffered. Austria adopted restitution laws which stipulate 
    that the Government must take the iniative and examine ownership relations. 
    Austria's federal museums and art galleries have already returned to their 
    lawful owners a great many works of art which were unjustly in their possession. 
    As you may know, several bilateral agreements were signed yesterday in connection 
    with the issue of slave and forced labour. And we are also making efforts 
    to find a solution, acceptable to both sides, regarding &quot;aryanizations&quot;. 
    The negotiations relating to this issue began yesterday.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THIS GRADUAL COMING TO TERMS WITH 
    THE PAST&#150; also in a legal sense &#150; was neglected for a long time 
    &#150; for too long, in fact. As a result, there has been a strain on this 
    so very important relationship with our fellow Jewish citizens and their descendants. 
    It must therefore be in our all interest to make up for these omissions. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
    also want the Jewish community in Austria to know that their contribution 
    to the cultural life of this country is a very valuable, even inalienable 
    component of how we see ourselves in this country. Austria and, in fact, Europe 
    owes many different and impressive elements to Judaism. We must therefore 
    continue to promote and protect Jewish life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ladies and Gentlemen, Perhaps you 
    may say: Haven't we known that all for a long time? Aren't these matters obvious? 
    &#150; Let me reply by also asking a question: Doesn't it also happen in Europe 
    today that fire bombs are thrown at synagogues? Doesn't it happen time and 
    again that Jewish cemeteries are desecrated? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
    be on the alert and to show personal courage are therefore the dictates of 
    the hour. Together, let us be vigilant guardians of these virtues!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, we can hear time and 
    again questions like &quot;Shouldn't we make a clean break with the events 
    of the past? Shouldn't we stop looking back on the past all the time? Let 
    me react by saying very clearly: It is only by remembering the victims that 
    we are able to mould our future. That is the lesson that Simon Wiesenthal, 
    the initiator of this Memorial, has taught us and followed as a model throughout 
    his life. I would therefore like to thank Simon Wiesenthal most cordially 
    - he who has been a great teacher for Austria when the issue at stake was 
    to let the truth prevail. He has always regarded himself as a self-sacrificing 
    admonisher. He has often been misunderstood; YET, HE NEVER GAVE UP FEELING 
    COMMITTED SOLELY TO THE HISTORIC TRUTH. Hardly any other person but him knows 
    so well how difficult it is to make it possible for others to experience our 
    memories and to measure, in all their dimensions and complexity, the questions 
    that I asked at the beginning: What is the time span for our recollections? 
    How long do times past last? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Richard 
    Beer-Hoffmann, the Jewish poet, gave his answer to the questions in his very 
    forceful verses when he wrote:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;All are within us. Who feels 
    alone? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You are their life 
    &#150; their life is yours.&quot;</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
