<blockquote> 
  <p><b><i>And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a Great Red 
    Dragon, having Seven heads and Ten horns, and Seven crowns upon his head...</i></b></p>
  <p><i><b>And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against 
    the dragon; and the dragon fought, and his angels,</b></i></p>
  <p><i><b>And prevailed not; neither was there their place found any more in 
    heaven.</b></i></p>
  <p><i><b>And the Great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent, called the Devil, 
    and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: HE WAS CAST OUT INTO THE EARTH, 
    and his angels were cast out with him.</b></i></p>
  <p><i><b>And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and 
    strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the 
    accuser of the brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day 
    and night...</b></i><b>(Revelation 12:3, 7-10)</b><i><b>.</b></i></p>

  <p><b><i>And here is the mind which hath Wisdom. The Seven heads are Seven mountains, 
    on which the Woman sitteth.</i></b></p>
  <p><i><b>And there are Seven kings </b></i>(the heads of the Seven great nation-empires...Egypt, 
    Assyria, Babylon, Persia, the Grecian, THE ROMAN, and the Holy Roman Empire 
    of Central Europe)<i><b>, five are fallen, AND ONE IS, and the other </b></i>(the 
    Seventh)<i><b> is not yet come; and when he cometh </b></i>(understand Napoleon 
    Bonapart)<i><b>, he must continue a short space.</b></i></p>

    no kingdom as yet </i></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(because 
    the mysteries of the Ten Sefirot were still hidden)</font><b><i>: but receiveth

  <p><i><b>These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the 
    Beast.</b></i></p>
  <p><i><b>These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them; 
    for he is the Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him

<p align="center"><b>THE TEN KINGS</b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">It was supposed by many that these Ten Kings represented 
  ten members of the European Common Market, until that number grew to 12, and 
  then fifteen. And though there <i>are</i> ten remaining monarchs left over from 
  the old ruling order of Europe--England, Belgium, Denmark, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, 
  Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden--the text in the Revelation 
  contains a deeper (kabbalistic) significance. As there are Ten Sefirot on the 
  Tree of Life, and each one a <i>Crown </i>as Paul said: <i>A Crown shall he 
  give me in that day...</i></font></p>

  structure of the mind of Darkness:</font></p>

  <p><b>&quot;There is no tabulated account of the hierarchy of the blessed Angels 
    in the Zohar, but we hear generically of great hosts and cohorts, battalions, 
    and guardians, usually for purposes of honor--AS WHEN ANGELS ACCOMPANY SHEKINAH 
    ON SOME OF HER MISSIONS. It is specified that METATRON </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
    Angel of Divine Presence)</font><b> is the leader of the invisible host </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(John 
    1:51; 2 Thessalonians 1:6-9; Isaiah 66:15,16)</font><b>, and that his place 
    is directly below the Throne of God </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Daniel 
    7:10)</font><b>. As regards THE INFERNAL HIERARCHY there are various catagories 
    consisting of Angels who kept not their first estate and of demons generated 
    in many ways....</b></p>

    THESE ARE THE AVERSE SERAPHIM IN THE FORM OF SERPENTS, EMANATING FROM THE 
    EVIL SERPENT. There are finally Seven Averse Palaces corresponding on the 
    one hand, to the Palaces (the various states of Mind that emanate from above), 
    and on the other to the Seven names which are attributed to the tempting spirit:

  <p><b>&quot;According to the Kabbalah, before the complete form of the Heavenly 
    Man was produced </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(in the dimensions 
    of the Ten Sefirot)</font><b>, there were certain primordial worlds created, 
    but these could not subsist, as THE EQUILIBRIUM OF BALANCE WAS NOT YET PERFECT, 
    AND THEY WERE CONVULSED BY THE UNBALANCED FORCE AND DESTROYED. THESE PRIMORDIAL 
    WORLDS ARE CALLED THE 'KINGS OF ANCIENT TIME,' and the 'KINGS OF EDOM WHO 
    REIGNED BEFORE THE MONARCHS OF ISRAEL.' </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(See 
    Hebrews 12:11-29)</font><b>. EDOM IS THE WORLD OF UNBALANCED FORCE, AND ISRAEL 
    IS THE BALANCED SEFIROTH </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Genesis 
    36:31)</font><b>. This important fact, that worlds were created and destroyed 
    prior to the present creation, is again and again reiterated in the Zohar.</b></p>
  <p><b>The Demons are the grossest and most deficient of all forms. THEIR TEN 
    DEGREES ANSWER TO THE DECAD OF THE SEPHIROTH, BUT IN INVERSE RATIO, AS DARKNESS 
    AND IMPURITY INCREASE WITH THE DESCENT OF EACH DEGREE. Next follow Seven Hells 
    occupied by those Demons which represent incarnate human vices, and torture 
    those who have given themselves up to such vices in earth-life. Their prince 
    is <i>Samael, </i>SMAL, the angel of Poison and Death. HIS WIFE IS THE HARLOT 
    , or Woman of Whoredom </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Revelation 
    17 and Ezekiel 16)</font><b>...AND UNITED THEY ARE CALLED BEAST. THUS THE

    OF THE SUPERNAL CREATIVE ONE. Samael is considered to be identical with Satan.&quot;
