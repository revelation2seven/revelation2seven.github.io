<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE SYMBOLIC COMPARISON 
  OF THE JEWS AND THE MOON</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Rabbi Avrohom Berger</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the approach of the month 
    of Nisan, we read the special </font><i><font size="+1">Parshah</font></i><font size="+1"> 
    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">of</font><font size="+1"> 
    <i>This month is for you the first of the months of the year</i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    because the month in which the Jewish people were redeemed from Egyptian slavery 
    is the first and foremost in the Jewish year. It is the time when the world 
    was created, when the patriarchs were born, and when we shall again be freed 
    from our present exile. </font>(Others have attributed these things to the 
    time of the New Moon of the Seventh Month)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Talmud tells us (</font><i><font size="+1">Sukah</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    29) that the Jewish calendar is based upon the Lunar Month, while the nations 
    of the world count their years according to the Sun. Where in the Torah is 
    there any indication that the Moon is the principal element upon which our 
    time-reckoning is founded? The Hebrew word for the a month is </font><i><font size="+1">Codesh</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    which means new or renewal. Because the Moon gives off no light of its own, 
    it is reflecting the light of the Sun. Each month the Moon is </font><i><font size="+1">born 
    again</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. As the Moon and 
    earth move along in their orbits, more of the Moon's sunlit part is seen, 
    until it shines as a Full Moon. Then less and less of the sunlit part is seen, 
    until the dark New Moon appears <font size="2">(in the West)</font>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All our holidays are based upon 
    the Moon, the heavenly body that revolves around the earth once in about 29 
    and a quarter days...The </font><i><font size="+1">Midrash</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    (Exodus) sees inthe rythm and orbit of the Moon a similarity and reflection 
    of Jewish history. Just as the Moon increases its light until it reaches a 
    complete fulness by the 15th of the month, and then it gradually diminishes 
    until it becomes dark, so it is with the Jewish nation. With the appearance 
    of the first Jew--</font><font size="+1"><i>Avraham Avinu</i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--on 
    the world scene, the world began to be illuminated by the spark of G-dliness. 
    The decendants of Avraham advanced the Jewish idea. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the time of Moshe </font><i><font size="+1">Rabeinu</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    a Torah nation was created. And in the 16th generation from Avraham, Judaism 
    reached its highest point in the reign of King Solomon, whose fame and wisdom 
    spread throughout the world, and who built the first Temple. The Jewish Moon 
    was full.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then the decline began. With the 
    ascending to the throne of Solomon's son, king Rehoboam, the Jewish kingdom 
    was split in two (and Ephraim went backwards), and the deterioration lasted 
    another 15 generations, until the time of king Zedekiah, the 30th generation 
    from Avraham, when the independent Jewish State disappeared with the destruction 
    of the </font><i><font size="+1">Beth Ha-mikdash</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    and the exile of the Jewish people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the prayer of the </font><i><font size="+1">Sanctification 
    of the Moon</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, we find 
    another resemblance of the Jewish people to the Moon. &quot;Just as the Moon 
    is renewed, so the Jewish people will be renewed,&quot; meaning that even 
    in the darkest hour we shouldn't despair. We always have the spiritual strength 
    and vigor to liberate ourselves from the dreary and gloomy situations in which 
    we sometimes find ourselves, (Daniel 12, for instance), and resume the struggle 
    to revitalize ourselves and to flourish and thrive again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since all of our beloved holidays 
    are dependent upon the date of the Jewish month, the Rabbinical Court had 
    to determine each month in accordance with <i>halachic</i> procedures, the 
    day when the new month will begin. The </font><i><font size="+1">Talmud</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    relates (</font><i><font size="+1">Rosh Hashana</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> 
    </i>25a) that once, when the Roman <font size="2">(read American)</font> authorities 
    prohibited the Jewish sages to proclaim officially when the new month will 
    start, in order that the Jews shouldn't be able to celebrate the holidays, 
    R. Yahuda Hanasie sent R. Chiya to a certain small town to establish the precise 
    time when the New Moon was seen, and when </font><i><font size="+1">Rosh Chodesh</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> 
    </i>will be. Since this had to be kept secret, they made up that in case the 
    mission will be successful, R. Chiya should send the news in the code words 
    of &quot;DAVID, THE KING OF ISRAEL IS ALIVE AND EXISTING.&quot; Rashi explains 
    that David is compared to the Moon, because the renewal of the Moon brings 
    with it the hope and expectation that the kingdom of David will be reborn.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This as also the reason, that at 
    the </font><i><font size="+1">Blessing of the Chodesh</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    we appeal to G-d, that He &quot;should redeem us in the near future, and gather 
    us from the Four corners of the world.&quot; Since the emergence of the New 
    Moon represents and embodies the idea of our national rejuvination and our 
    hopes and dreams for redemption, so we pour out our hearts to </font><i><font size="+1">Hashem</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    and urge Him to transform the concept of the Jewish comparison to the Moon, 
    into the concrete reality of actual redemption, and to make it an accomplished 
    fact. </font>The Jewish Press<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">.</font></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE FIRST GEULA AND 
  THE ULTIMATE GEULA</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By R. Shmuel M. Butman</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In </font><i><font size="+1">Nissan</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> 
    </i>our ancestors were redeemed, and in </font><i><font size="+1">Nissan</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    they will in the future be redeemed,&quot; say our sages (</font><i><font size="+1">Talmud, 
    Rosh Hashana</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> </i>11a,<i> 
    </i></font><i><font size="+1">Midrash Shmos Rabba</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> 
    </i>15:11). More specifically, the Geula (Redemption) that started with the 
    exodus from Egypt was incomplete for it was followed by further exile and 
    suffering. But the process of Geula that started then continues till now and 
    will be completed in the true ultimate Geula with the coming of </font><i><font size="+1">Moshiach</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the </font><i><font size="+1">Seder</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    the start of </font><i><font size="+1">Pesach</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    the emphasis is on the </font><i><font size="+1">mitzva</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    of the Evening, which is to tell how our ancestors were liberated from Egypt. 
    We conclude this mitzva with the first two chapters of </font><i><font size="+1">Hallal</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    (psalms of praise)--(</font><i><font size="+1">Tehilim/Psalms</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> 
    </i>113 and 114)--which refer to G-d's </font><i><font size="+1">descent</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    to the low spiritual depths of Egypt in order to raise us up from there to 
    the very heights when we received the Torah at Mount Sinai. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the end of the Seder refers 
    to the future Geula. We pour out a special </font><i><font size="+1">Koso 
    shel Eliyahu</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, a cup for 
    Eliyahu (Elijah) the prophet who will announce that the Geula is here. We 
    go to the outside door to greet him, asking G-d to make this the time to give 
    our people's persecutors their just deserts, <font size="2">(be careful)</font>. 
    Continuing immediately with the last four psalms of Hallal (Psalms 115 to 
    118) which start with these words, we specify that we ask this of G-d, </font><i><font size="+1">Not 
    for our sake, G-d, not for our sake but for the sake of Your Name</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    And we conclude the Seder with the words: </font><i><font size="+1">THE COMING 
    YEAR IN JERUSALEM</font></i>.</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IN FACT, THE FIRST <i>YOM TOV</i> 
    DAY (the first of the Seven days of Passover) EMPHASIZES THE ORIGINAL GEULA 
    FROM EGYPT, WHILE THE LAST YOM TOV DAY EMPHASIZES THE FUTURE GEULA. This becomes 
    clearer as the yom tov draws to a close.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the Seventh Day of Pesach, the 
    anniversary of the splitting of the sea, the public Torah reading includes 
    the famous Song of Praise </font><font size="+1">(<i>Shmos</i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">/Exodus 
    15:1-19) <font size="2">(Understand Revelation 15:1-4, KJV)</font> after that 
    great miracle, starting with the words </font><i><font size="+1">Oz yoshir</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--&quot;then 
    Moshe sang.&quot; Literally, however, the words mean &quot;he <i>will</i> 
    sing--one of our sages' proofs that the Torah forecasts the future RESURRECTION 
    OF THE DEAD that will culminate the ultimate Geula.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Song concludes with the words: 
    </font><i><font size="+1">You will bring them and plant them on the Mountain 
    of Your Inheritance, the Prepared place that You, G-d, have made for Your 
    abode, the Sanctuary that Your Hands, G-d, have established. G-d shall be 
    King forever and ever</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Rashi, the most basic commentator, explains that this refers to the future 
    </font><i><font size="+1">Beis Hamikdash</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    in Jerusalem which will be built by G-d's Hands at the time that His sovereignty 
    will be seen by the entire world to be everlasting--in the future <font size="2">(most 
    imminent)</font> Geula.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When this Song is read in the weekly 
    Torah readings of each </font><i><font size="+1">Shabbos</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> 
    </i>(Sabbath), the </font><i><font size="+1">Haftora</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> 
    </i>(reading of the Prophets) that follows is the </font><i><font size="+1">Song 
    of Devorah</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> </i>(Deborah) 
    <i>(</i></font><i><font size="+1">Shoftim</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>/</i>Judges, 
    chapter 5). But on the Seventh day of Pesach, the Haftora is specifically 
    the Song of King David (</font><i><font size="+1">Shmuel II</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>, 
    </i>chapter 22) the founder of the royal house from whom Moshiac descends, 
    to emphasize his connection to the future Geula.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, on the last day of Pesach, 
    the Haftora (</font><i><font size="+1">Yashayahu</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">/Isaiah 
    10:32 to 12:6) speaks at length about Moshiac and the wonders of the Messianic 
    era: ...</font><i><font size="+1">A shoot shall come forth from the stem of 
    Yishai</font></i><font size="+1">/Jesse....<i>The spirit of G-d shall rest 
    upon him...He shall be permeated with the spirit of the fear of G-d</i>..</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.all 
    referring openly to Moshiach.</font><font size="+1"> ...<i>The wolf shall

    the far-flung islands of the sea</i>...<i>He will gather the exiled of Israel</i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...the 
    ingathering of the exiles.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is why the </font><i><font size="+1">Baal

    </font><i><font size="+1">Chassidus</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    initiated the custom to eat a Third festive meal on the last afternoon of 
    Pesach, called </font><i><font size="+1">Seudas Moshiach</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--the 
    &quot;festive meal of Moshiach.&quot; The fifth leader of Chabad, Rabbi Sholem 
    Dov Ber of Lubavitch, started the custom of drinking Four cups of wine at 
    this meal (parallel) to the Four cups drunk at the Seder at the start of Pesach). 
    On this day, our Rebbes tell us, &quot;SHINES THE RADIANCE OF THE LIGHT OF 
    MOSHIACH<i>.</i>&quot; And this gives us the strength to to continue on during 
    the very last moments of our exile as we prepare to go out to greet Moshiach. 
    May it be NOW.&quot; </font></p>
  <p>(Many in the Luvavitcher sect believed, and many still believe, that Rebbe 
    Menachem Schneerson was the Moshiac. This, of course, was not true. The Anointed 
    Ones will not appear from any of the Zionist factions of Judaism. But of those 
    who have been faithfully <i>keeping the Fig Tree</i>, it is written):</p>
