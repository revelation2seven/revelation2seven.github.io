  <p align="left"> &quot;In today&#146;s global economy, we see a dramatic rise 
    in inflation; exponentially increasing debt increased geopolitical tension; 
    an escalation in global poverty; a widening disparity between rich and poor; 
    and wide-scale environmental degradation. How do we deal with these problems? 
    If we want to create a world that works for all of us, the power to create 
    money must be decentralized and brought back to the individual and community 
    level. This shift in power is critical to the survival of life and development 
    of a positive future. </p>
  <p>Local Currencies in the 21st Century is a conference convened in affirmation 
    of an emerging era of vibrant citizen activism. The conference goal is to 
    empower attendees by providing an understanding of the principles of monetary 
    issue and the techniques by which communities can create their own regional 
    currency systems. We imagine a network of robust local economies, benefiting 
    small businesses and family farms, and involving consumers ever more directly 
    with the people and land of their community.</p>
  <p>In today&#146;s global economy national currencies have had the effect of 
    centralizing ownership of wealth and widening the gap between rich and poor&#151;all 
    the while undermining local communities, devastating indigenous peoples, and 
    polluting the environment. Decentralized regional currencies are an important 
    counterforce working to redistribute wealth more broadly while supporting 
    unique regional identities, cultures, and communities. A local currency defines 
    a regional trading area, favoring those small independent businesses willing 
    to trade in the currency. Local businesses, unable to compete with the products 
    of an increasingly predatory global economy, become strong players in resilient, 
    regional marketplaces.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> <br>
    WHAT IS DECENTRALISM?</p>
  <p>Transcending traditional categories of &#147;right&#148; and &#147;left,&#148; 
    decentralism has been the logical meeting place for those in many fields of 
    endeavor who believe that preserving human scale and encouraging a spirit 
    of community are essential for the human spirit to thrive. In a world afflicted 
    with giantism in its social, economic, and political institutions, decentralism 
    is often mistakenly identified as radical, but it is in fact based on many 
    traditional values. Decentralists are a diverse group, but they share a common 
    belief in restoring community self-reliance and bringing economic and social 
    activities back to a more human scale. </p>
  <p>Over the centuries, human scale has had many eloquent advocates, ranging 
    from Lao Tzu and Aristotle to Kropotkin and Jefferson, Gandhi and Chesterton. 
    Fritz Schumacher introduced the concept of human scale to mainstream industrial 
    society in the book <i>Small Is Beautiful: Economics As If People Mattered</i>. 
    In it he called for an economy of permanence, based on human values and sustainable 
    uses of natural resources, and this marked a cultural shift in our thinking 
    about economics.</p>
  <p>Schumacher&#146;s ideas rekindled a modern interest in the human scale, decentralist 
    approach, one which has been intensified by today&#146;s social, economic, 
    and environmental crises. The modern environmental movement has awakened an 
    interest in the decentralized approach as issues of energy use, resource consumption, 
    bioregional preservation gain urgency. Intensified globalization has brought 
    forth the need for cultural and community preservation and appropriate technologies. 
    Many visionaries and activists in a variety of fields have opted to develop 
    small-scale, community-based solutions to these problems. Together with the 
    writings of Leopold Kohr, farmer Wendell Berry, economist Ralph Borsodi, regional 
    planner Jane Jacobs, bioregionalist Kirkpatrick Sale, and many others, they 
    continue to build a modern decentralist legacy.</p>
  <p>The Schumacher Society is dedicated to gathering this rich decentralist tradition, 
    continuing to bring the values of scale and sustainability into our modern 
    discourse, and demonstrating that small is not only beautiful&#150; it is 
    a viable alternative.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="center">WHY LOCAL CURRENCIES?</p>
  <p align="center">By Chris Lindstrom</p>
  <p>In today's global economy our national currencies tend to flow where money 
    is concentrated, rather than where money is scarce. As money is centralized, 
    so is the productive economy&shy;-the part of the economy that produces real 
    wealth. Manufacturing locations are chosen based on access to cheap labor 
    and technology rather than out of ecological and humanitarian considerations. 
    This trend has undermined regional economies and created economic, social, 
    and environmental imbalances throughout the world. It is a trend that cannot 
    be reversed by electoral politics or street demonstrations. Change must happen 
    at a local level aided by the implementation of local and complementary currencies. 
  </p>
  <p>To create a local currency is not a form of local isolationism; it is not 
    cutting oneself off from the rest of the world; it is simply a movement of 
    citizens taking responsibility for the well being of their own community. 
    Local and community currencies do not seek to replace national currencies, 
    but to supplement them, hence the increasingly popular term &quot;complementary 
    currencies.&quot; Ultimately the goals of complementary currencies are to 
    renew and uplift community, to create a sustainable and environmentally beneficial 
    economy, and to empower all people with a new sense of what's possible.</p>
  <p>One of the objectives of &quot;Local Currencies in the 21st Century&quot; 
    is to bring the concept of local and complementary currencies to a broader 
    audience. We are very excited about the remarkable group of conference co-sponsors 
    who have agreed to help with this task, featuring such prominent publications 
    as The Nation, Acres USA, Resurgence, Orion, Yes! A Journal of Positive Futures, 
    World Affairs: The Journal of International Issues, E Magazine, In Business, 
    and Dollars &amp; Sense. In addition, a host of prestigious and pioneering 
    organizations are supporting the conference including Co-op America, BALLE, 
    Investor&sup1;s Circle, Chelsea Green Publishing, Institute for Local Self 
    Reliance, NOFA Mass, Center for Community Futures, Community Environmental 
    Legal Defense Fund, New Economics Foundation, and the Hawthorne Valley Association. 
    And lastly, some of the ground breaking practitioners and pioneers of local 
    and complementary currencies will be joining us from the ACCESS Foundation, 
    Community Information Resource Center, Ithaca HOURS, Maine Time Dollar Network, 
    and the Time Dollar Institute. With this team of visionary co-sponsors we 
    are confident of taking the local currency movement into its new role in the 
    twenty-first century. All that is needed is your participation and enthusiasm 
    to bring this transformative tool to your community.</p>
  <p> We are pleased to announce that Pete Seeger will be attending as our honorary 
    guest along with Gandhian economist, Dwarko Sundrani. Pete will be performing 
    Sunday evening at the Local Food Fest, a closing cookout with festivities 
    to celebrate and honor local and family farmers. The closing event will be 
    open to the public; so those with family and friends in the region, please 
    welcome guests for a night of home-grown food and entertainment. </p>
  <p> In addition to a stellar cast of keynote speakers, the conference program, 
    still in preparation, will feature workshop presenters from all over the world. 
    Joining us from Sweden is Per Almgren, designer of the interest-free savings 
    and loans system developed in 1973 and used by the Swedish JAK bank (http://www.jak.se) 
    that is owned and managed by its 23,000 members. Per will be giving presentations 
    on his experience with interest-free banking and will talk about ways to secure 
    a local currency with conventional money.</p>
  <p> Another extraordinary person taking part in the program is Auta Main, executive 
    director of the Maine Time Dollar Network (soon to be the New England Time 
    Dollar Network), who has helped build the MTDN into a model for others throughout 
    the rest of the country and the world. She now serves as the interim Community 
    Revitalization Director for Time Dollars USA, where she and other Time Dollar 
    pioneers from around the country are working with Edgar Cahn (founder of Time 
    Dollars) on organizational development for the new national network.</p>
  <p> Coming from Japan are Ikuma Saga and Takanori Yamamoto. Together, they will 
    be representing the Earth Day Money Association, a community currency in Japan 
    that promotes environmentally friendly behavior. They will report on the local 
    and complementary currency movement in Japan and how it is helping many Japanese 
    communities deal with the problems facing the nation today. </p>
  <p> The story of money has been obscured from public view. Monetary reform has 
    appeared sporadically throughout our nation&sup1;s history as a heated topic 
    of aspiring politicians who championed it as a central platform in their election 
    bid, but whose passion for reform died down once in office. It is responsibility 
    of peace loving citizens through out the world to bring this back into the 
    public eye.</p>
  <p>Please join us in June at Bard College for a conference dedicated to Understanding 
    Money, Building Local Economies, and Renewing Community.</p>

    <p>&quot;True economics never militates against the highest ethical standard, 
      just as all true ethics to be worth its name must at the same time be also 
      good economics. An economics that inculcates Mammon worship, and enables 
      the strong to amass wealth at the expense of the weak, is a false and dismal 
      science. It spells death. True economics, on the other hand, stands for 
      social justice, it promotes the good of all equally including the weakest 
      and is indispensable for decent life.&quot; Mahatma Gandhi, Harijan, October 
      9, 1937</p>
    <p>&quot;A way of life that ever more rapidly depletes the power of earth 
      to sustain it and piles up ever more insoluble problems for each succeeding 
      generation can only be called 'violent.' In short, man&sup1;s urgent task 
      is to discover a nonviolent way in his economics as well as in his political 
      life. Present day economics, while claiming to be ethically neutral, in

  <p>&quot;Citizen activists, listen up! We all know how loud money can talk in 
    American culture, especially in these days of global capitalism. But money 
    isn't only about power. It can also be about empowerment. Rather than try 
    to turn down money's volume, an increasing number of people from many walks 
    of life are working to create a new language for currency. The local currency 
    movement, which has been steadily gaining in popularity over the past 30 years, 
    includes activists, economists, farmers, environmentalists, regional planners, 
    community development professionals, academics, and small businesspeople from 
    around the world. At its forefront is the E.F. Schumacher Society, named for 
    the author of the now classic text on sustainability, Small Is Beautiful. 
    This month, the Great Barrington, Massachusetts-based E.F. Schumacher Society 
    is hosting an international three-day conference at Bard College on &quot;Local 
    Currencies in the 21st Century.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;The Schumacher Society has, since its formation, been interested in 
    local currencies as a tool for encouraging more vibrant regional economies,&quot; 
    says the organization's director, Susan Witt. &quot;What Schumacher proposed 
    was that you produce locally for local consumption - that was his basic concept. 
    What we're about is trying to figure out: What are the local tools that would 
    encourage local production? What are the solutions that citizens can shape 
    themselves rather than looking for government solutions? &quot;</p>
  <p>Although the local currency movement is generally little known, the concept 
    is not exactly new. &quot;Local currencies have actually been going on for 
    centuries,&quot; says Chris Lindstrom, who is coordinating the conference. 
    For instance, tribal commerce is traditionally based on a gift economy, he 
    explains, &quot;with everyone taking care of whatever needs to be taken care 
    of,&quot; and during the Dark Ages, &quot;everyone had their own currency 
    in Europe; it's when economies evolve, becoming more complex, that currencies 
    usually enter the picture.&quot;</p>
  <p>In the US, local currency reemerged in the early part of the 20th century, 
    gaining headway during the Great Depression, says Lindstrom. &quot;A lot of 
    communities throughout the world started to create their own currency systems 
    as a way of addressing the deflation or inflation of their own currency.&quot;</p>
  <p>The Wir Network (its name is the German word for we), founded in Switzerland 
    in 1931, is the first established system and the longest lasting, with over 
    80,000 members today. &quot;It's a hybrid of community-issued loans of the 
    currency within the network and mutual credit - the direct debiting and crediting 
    of accounts between members. When I buy something from you my account is debited, 
    your account is credited,&quot; Lindstrom explains. &quot;It's brought Switzerland 
    through a lot of ups and downs in their economy, and allowed the Swiss economy 
    to remain relatively stable.&quot;</p>
  <p>Next on the local currency movement's chronology is the establishment in 
    Canada of the first Local Economic Trading System (LETS) network. With local 
    networks numbering over 1,400 throughout the world, LETS members trade goods 
    and services among each other, and use a central operator to acknowledge each 
    trade.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the best-known continuing functioning local currency system is Ithaca 
    Hours, established in 1989 in Ithaca, New York, by Paul Glover. &quot;He issued 
    it by sending out twenty hours [each] to people who agreed to participate 
    in the system and it gradually evolved to include loans made out to community 
    businesses,&quot; says Lindstrom.</p>
  
</div>
<div align="left">
  <p>If there is a hero in the world of alternative currency systems, it's Glover. 
    &quot;Paul Glover made a sacrifice,&quot; says Lindstrom. &quot;He was willing 
    to accept Ithaca Hours and be limited to meeting his living needs within the 
    local economy - which meant that he was limited to the stuff he could buy 
    at the farmer's market and to certain services, like the family practitioner 
    who was willing to take Ithaca Hours.&quot;</p>
  <p>Like Glover, in 1989, the Schumacher Society began experimenting with local 
    currency, starting with the issuance of &quot;Deli Dollars.&quot; The program 
    was specifically geared toward helping an existing business remain in business 
    after it lost its space. The way it worked, explains Lindstrom, was that &quot;you 
    paid eight dollars for a future face value of ten dollars. When the dollars 
    matured in few months you could exchange them for food. So many people ate 
    at the deli that they started to circulate the Deli Dollars within the local 
    economy. The dollars wound up being passed around among people and used functionally 
    as a currency.&quot;</p>
  Deli Dollars was such a success it was dubbed by the international press as 
  an example of &quot;Yankee ingenuity - a way to let a business thrive during 
  economic downturn,&quot; says Lindstrom. In fact, adds Witt, &quot;the publicity 
  was completely beyond the scope of the five thousand dollars the deli raised 
  - there was probably at least six million dollars worth of international TV 
  programs.&quot;</div>
<div align="left">
  <p>Next, the Schumacher Society issued Berkshire Farm Preserve Notes from 1989 
    to 1991. &quot;There's really an ethic here in the Berkshires for finding 
    those citizen-based solutions,&quot; says Witt. &quot;Following Deli Dollars 
    we worked with two farms, Taft Farm and Corn Crib, to issue the Notes. Again, 
    that was a way for consumers to support the kind of small farms they want 
    to see in this region.&quot;</p>
  <p>Also under Witt's direction, the merchants in Great Barrington started BerkShares, 
    a summertime promotions program. &quot;The shares weren't a true local currency 
    yet,&quot; explains Witt. &quot;For every ten dollars you spent at one of 
    the seventy participating businesses you were given one BerkShare; then, during 
    a three-day period in September, you could use those BerkShares as cash.&quot; 
    Once again, the experiment was a success. According to Witt, $75,000 went 
    into circulation, and $28,000 was returned. &quot;That's a huge return on 
    a giveaway,&quot; she says. &quot;There was a real spirit of festivity in 
    the community.&quot;</p>
  <p>Currently, Witt is working on establishing a year-round local currency, possibly 
    to be backed by farm produce during the summer and cord wood in the winter 
    months. &quot;We, of course, have concepts of what a local program will look 
    like, but its evolution will grow out of the local community,&quot; says Witt. 
    &quot;What this conference is doing is bringing up the principles for sound 
    monetary issue. If a community is going to take on issuing its own currency, 
    how does it do so in a responsible, sustainable, sound way?&quot;</p>
  <p>Any given community is capable of successfully starting its own currency 
    system, says Lindstrom, so long as those involved are well-informed. &quot;The 
    most valuable resource for starting a local currency system is information 
    and reason,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of them have not succeeded due to lack 
    of information or understanding as to how to sustain something like this. 
    The ones that have been successful have also managed to reach out to very 
    important sectors of the local economy. That's the discussion we want people 
    at the conference to have.&quot;</p>

  <p><font size="+1">During the sing-along on Sunday afternoon, the kind that 
    only he could orchestrate, the legendary folk singer Pete Seeger said, &quot;I 
    believe this is the very best conference I have ever attended.&quot; The effects, 
    but also the timing of this conference on alternative economics (and others 
    like it) cannot be overstated. Only the Spirit Herself could have convened 
    it. Unlike the strident voices of revolution attending so many of the mass 
    meetings and demonstrations throughout the country and the world since September 
    11, those who came to the campus of Bard College this weekend, from local 
    areas, other states, and from many other places on earth, came to sit and 
    listen, to add their voices, their (tremendous) insights and concerns, and 
    to ask hard questions. &quot;Think globally, act locally.&quot; In keeping 
    with this <i>profound</i> social concept this has been called a conference 
    on &quot;local&quot; economies. And well it was, but, knowingly or not, the 
    nearly three hundred souls in attendance actually came to continue the work 
    (to sort out the nuts and bolts if you will) of the next global order--the 
    next economic paradigm. They assembled here to lay the spiritual and intellectual, 
    as well as the technical groundwork for the revolutionary, nonviolent change 
    that is in every sense of things already happening, but which will perfect 
    itself in the attending crises of our times, as this age continues to come 
    to its conclusion and the new is born. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Bernard Lietaer, the author of <i>The Future of Money</i>, 
    and one of the first keynote speakers, said that we are presently in the <i>Wright 
    Brothers</i> stage of production, that we are trying to build a craft (the 
    framework of a viable alternative economy that can actually fly--<i>from here 
    to there</i> so to say--and weather the winds and currents of economic reality). 
    Many of our attempts, at both community and a viable alternative economies, 
    have, and will crash, he said, advising everyone not to be discouraged. Get 
    back to the drawing board, he said, retool and gear up to the next level of 
    understanding, and involvement. Mary Beth Raddon (<i>A Wealth of Experience: 
    Community Currencies Past &amp; Present</i>), was refreshingly honest about 
    the subject when she spoke to the assembly of the several reasons for the 
    many failed attempts--from the Utopians of the 19th century right up to the 
    present--at creating alternative local economies. Many had to do with <i>personality</i>, 
    most with the overwhelming presence of the larger market economy (the great 
    Beast). But perhaps a primary reason was described (unfortunately, all too 
    briefly, because the point was by and large missed) by an individual who rose 
    to speak, suggesting that it lay partly in our inability at present to distinguish 
    between (what the speaker called) local <i>recreational</i> currencies<i> 
    </i>and <i>life-issue </i>currencies--between attempts at creating (what want 
    to be) alternatives to the greater capitalism (but which are not), and the 
    real work of economic transformation itself. The implication being that the 
    <i>real</i> must be born of real needs (real cause and effect), not the pastime 
    recreations (however well meaning) of the already generally well-to-do liberal 
    middle class, or in further capital investments in the present economic order, 
    no matter how altruistic. Such real changes, of course, can only come when 
    History (the Cosmos...God) moves the wheels (they are turning)...</font></p>

  <p><font size="+1">...thus when the time is right (that day is fast approaching), 
    but must, as the speaker suggested, be rooted, not in the attempt at making 
    our already-comfortable lives more comfortable but in the most basic exigencies 
    of life itself. Let us be perfectly clear, the poor cannot at present afford 
    local organically grown produce, or to shop at the local health food store. 
    Paul Glover, the founder of Ithaca HOURS, who speaks forthrightly on the subject 
    of the corporate takeover of the organic food industry, is also aware of the 
    disparity, and seeks to encourage and provide ways in which the poor and disenfranchised 
    can <i>work</i> their way into Ithaca's alternative economy. Ithaca Hours, 
    however, are still tied directly to the greater capitalist economy. Each Ithaca 
    HOUR is valued at $10 American money. There are many among us, however, who 
    are still not paid ten dollars an hour for their labor, and even when they 
    are, there are many others who can command much more. Until all the participants 
    in the economy are earning the same <i>per hour</i> (the same Hour<i>) </i>as

    these issues, to the plight of youth, community health, education, public 
    housing, the elderly and the care of children with emotional disorders. Their 
    Time Dollar initiatives, while not based on an actual currency, are both a 
    concept and a strategy for furthering changes in the present system and enhancing 
    everyone's sense of the imperitives of social justice. Nevertheless, the introduction 
    to a workshop the Cahns are giving at an upcoming International Time Banking 
    Congress, being held in August, 2004, states:</font></p>

      welfare systems aim to support and strengthen those who are struggling to

      in their neighborhoods, inadequate housing, medical care and transportation 
      needs, emotional disorders, mental and physical disabilities, and so on. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Too often, those systems systematically 
      perpetuate the problem and/or create harmful dependencies, or are simply

      a huge emphasis on &quot;asset-based&quot; and &quot;strength-based&quot; 
      approaches that will do better--but too often the dependency-creating relationships 
      between &quot;professionals&quot; and &quot;clients&quot; change very little. 
      Through illustrative case studies and joint problem solving, this workshop 
      asks: HOW CAN TIME DOLLARS AND CO-PRODUCTION LEAD TO REAL SYSTEMS CHANGE?

<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">Bernard Lietaer said that though the present world economy 
    <i>is the problem</i>, the chances of reforming the world's Central Banks 
    are unlikely. Taking a pragmatic view, as did several others in the conference, 
    he said that we must try to devise our way with them in mind, and work around 
    them where we can, and with them where we must. (Perhaps this pact with <i>the 
    devil</i> is our only option at present, but let us be certain, it is the 
    World Banks and the present Economic World Order that are fated to come down, 
    leaving the sky clear for all the little ideas--the local economies--that 
    shall immediately come off the ground in the wake of such a <i>great crash.

Nevertheless, it behooves us to bear constantly in mind that the 
usurious rapacity of the macro-regime will ultimately overwhelm our
best efforts as it completes its terrible course. The local currency
movement, if it does not move forward in sufficient mindfulness of the 
need for concomitant macro reform, may turn out to be little more than
(a passing distraction). On the other hand, with its special insight,
quality of commitment and experience with usury-free commerce, it 
could plant the seed for the transformation of the monetary system as
a whole. Clarity and focus is everything. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Richard Kotlarz, Usury: The Strange

    <p>The Money Masters</p>
    <p>The Money Masters video is an excellent production with sound history and 
      professionally created images. It tells the story of our debauched money 
      system in a highly entertaining and convincing manner. There is just one 
      problem with it. It offers a false solution - which is to say that it offers 
      no solution at all. The alleged solution is that we abandon our present 
      fiat money system and adopt another one very much like it. Yes, it advocates 
      FIAT money! The proposal is that we should take the power to create money--out-of-nothing--away 
      from those big, bad bankers and turn it over to those nice, trustworthy 
      politicians, instead. It is na&iuml;ve to think that politicians are any 
      more trustworthy than bankers. The problem with money created out of nothing 
      is not who does it but that it is done at all.<br>
      <br>
      In this regard, Money Masters is very much like William Greider's book, 
      Secrets of the Temple, which was offered to the unsuspecting public as a 
      scathing expose of the Federal Reserve System. His history was excellent, 
      but his conclusion was treacherous. After having proven that the Fed was 
      conceived as a weapon of the banking elite against the common man and having 
      shown throughout his book that this is exactly the function it has always 
      served, his conclusion was, not to abolish the Fed or even to make serious 
      changes to it. His call to action was simply to stop worrying about it. 
      The Fed has made mistakes, he said, but we have learned many lessons along 
      the way. All we need now are wiser men to run it! That is exactly the kind 
      of solution that made his book acceptable to the giant publishing house, 
      Simon and Schuster. It is no solution at all. The elite do not care what 
      you know about a problem if you don't do anything about it. They are quite 
      good at putting forth their own opposition - writers like Greider - who 
      will sound the alarm and rally the troops but lead them exactly nowhere.<br>
      <br>
      More recently, Simon and Schuster published another book in this same category, 
      Day of Deceit: The Truth about FDR and Pearl Harbor, by Robert Stinnett. 
      It is a block buster of facts and previously hidden documents proving beyond 
      any doubt that FDR, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, General George Marshall, 
      and many others high in the Roosevelt Administration secretly plotted to 
      cause Japan to successfully Attack Pearl Harbor as an excuse to get the 
      United Stated into World War II. So, what was Stinnett's conclusion? Was 
      it to condemn these men for treachery against their fellow Americans? Not 
      at all. It was that they were justified in doing so as a means of putting 
      a stop to Nazism in Europe. In other words, it was an act of great statesmanship! 
      Once again, Simon and Schuster provided the American people with a false 
      opinion leader. What's the point of getting all frothed up over a President 
      deliberately causing thousands of Americans to be killed if we are then 
      to decide that he was a hero for doing so?<br>
      <br>
      That is exactly what Bill Still has done in Money Masters. The solution 
      to fiat money is NOT more fiat money. It is REAL money based on tangible 
      assets, and none has yet been discovered that serves as well as gold and 
      silver. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Why not gold and silver? 
      Because one must go down into the Darkness to get them. One must continue 
      to rape and plunder the Divine Mother Herself to acquire them. Please understand 
      Zephaniah 1:14-18)</font>. The assertion in the video that wooden sticks 
      were successfully used in England as money is grossly misleading. Sticks 
      were used to a very limited degree in some areas as a substitute for tax 
      money, but at no time in history were sticks ever used as a medium of exchange 
      for meaningful economic transactions. To propose that we now can live with 
      fiat money based on this myth is a despicable act of deception. Beware The 
      Money Masters. It is a trap.<br>

  <p><font size="+1">All of which brings us back to the first two plenary speakers 
    at the conference, Dwarko Sundrani and Margirit Kennedy: Dwarko Sundrani, 
    one of the last living disciple of Ghandi, spoke of <i>total commitment</i>, 
    not only to the idea of social justice in the world, but to the people--always 
    to the people--who are the very real victims of the present world order:</font></p>
  <p align="center">MY LIFE IS MY MESSAGE: AN EVENING WITH DWARKO SUNDRANI</p>
  <p></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left">
    <p>October 23, 2002, Santa Clara</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
<p>A reporter once asked Gandhi, &quot;Bapu, give me your message for the 
      people.&quot; He instantly replied from a moving train, &quot;My life is 
      my message.&quot; Repeatedly, Gandhi asked his supporters to burn all his 
      books and words on his own funeral pyre: &quot;Those who believe in the 
      simple truths I have laid out can propagate them only by living them.&quot; 
      Dwarko Sundrani paid attention. Today, at 80 years of age, he is the last 
      active disciple of Gandhi and living the message of his teacher.</p>
    <p>In Bodhgaya (India) -- the place of Buddha's enlightenment -- Dwarko started 
      with running a school for the poorest of the poor. His aim wasn't just mathematics, 
      chemistry and history, but rather the &quot;total development of man&quot;. 
      Today, he has founded a network of 360 schools and engages in all kinds 
      of social action: from eye camps to vocational services for the underprivileged. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>Dwarko-ji, as he's often referred to in India, also runs an ashram in Bihar. 
      At his ashram, S.N. Goenka gave one of his first 10-day meditation courses, 
      which has reached hundreds of thousands of people since; it was there that 
      Satish Kumar, a student of Dwarko, commenced his revolutionary peace-walk 
      from Gandhi's grave to Kennedy's grave. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited 
      him. Vinoba Bhave, regarded as Gandhi's spiritual successor, entrusted him 
      with running his own ashram and J. Krishnamurti shared an experience of 
      immense joy in their first personal encounter. The stories go on and on. 
      It is no wonder that the 14th Dalai Lama, his close friend, says to him: 
      &quot;Dwarko-ji, I teach compassion but you live it!&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;The purpose of life is to give service,&quot; Dwarko says. From birth 
      to death, we are continuously receiving service, whether it is from our 
      mothers or the plants in our backyard, and it is our duty as human beings 
      to give back to the inter-connected circle of life. When you hear this from 
      Dwarko, somehow, it almost seems common sense. </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>'I Don't Know'</p>
    
  </div>
  <div align="left">
<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot; For a lot of people, those three words can be 
      terrifying. But for Dwarko, they may as well be his favorite words. How 
      did you come to pick Buddha's birthplace as your place of service? I don't 
      know. How do you sustain all these huge projects if you never ask anyone 
      for a donation? I don't know. Dwarko says that it's not his job to know; 
      he is just an instrument of service, in the hands of nature. </p>
    <p>When you have the heart to let go to such a great extent, you bloom wherever 
      you are planted. In his youth, Dwarko didn't want to marry but when his 
      Dad insisted, he put forth one condition -- &quot;I will marry if you don't 
      take any dowry.&quot; After a heated exchange of words, he left his home 
      and became a teacher. (He never did marry but after 35 years, his Dad did 
      eventually reconnect with him.).</p>
    <p>Dwarko had six rupees (worth a dime today) when he first ended up in Bihar; 
      he needed that six rupees to take the train and reach the ashram of Vinoba 
      Bhave. As it turned out, a poor person on the street asked him for the money. 
      Spontaneously, he gave it away! Instead of taking the train, he walked for 
      a couple of days straight and managed to eventually reach his destination 
      ... errrr destiny. </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>My life is my message, as Gandhi would say. </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>To give away literally everything you have is no easy feat. In fact, one 
      wonders if that's even possible. But Dwarko Sundrani is proof positive that 
      it's possible. His work today spans millions of rupees and more importantly, 
      has positively affected thousands of people all over the world. He still 
      doesn't know what he is doing, where is going to be tomorrow, and why he's 
      doing it. And that, actually, is the beauty of it all. </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Soul Force</p>
    
  </div>
  <div align="left">
<p>&quot;When I was young, I once burned a post office for protest,&quot; 
      he said with a wry smile. If you weren't hearing this from the last active 
      disciple of Gandhi, you'd wonder. But for Dwarko, it symbolizes yet another 
      victory over the violent tendencies of the mind. An eye for an eye, over 
      time, will leave the whole world blind. Violence just seemed to destroy 
      what he was trying to build and so Dwarko abandoned his naive ways. </p>
    <p>He developed a new weapon to connect with ideas, things and people -- soul 
      force. Words used to be mightier than weapons but in this age of information 
      overload, words have lost their meaning. Action programs used to work but 
      they are also losing their power due to confused means. &quot;Time has come 
      for using soul force, collective soul force,&quot; Dwarko proclaims.</p>
    <p>Real education for him is an understanding of this soul force. Math, science, 
      and history are necessary but those subjects are simply the glass that holds 
      the water. If you're really interested in quenching your thirst, you have 
      to drink the water. Dwarko explains: &quot;Gandhi's mission wasn't just 
      India's independence. That was a very small part. His real purpose was to 
      create a new man.&quot; </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>For Dwarko, development of that new man of soul force, a man of non-violence, 
      is &quot;true education&quot;.</p>
    <p>&quot;Non-violence isn't a campaign. It's a way of life,&quot; Dwarko emphatically 
      says. And he learned this straight from the man of the 20th century, the 
      father of India, his teacher -- Mahatma Gandhi. For Gandhi, as you know, 
      even haste was a form of violence. An action of violence stems from a thought 
      of violence, which arises from dissatisfaction with the present. And that 
      present moment is every moment. </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>Seven Blunders of The World</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>Dwarko was later asked, &quot;Gandhi faced the cultured British rule but 
      do you think he could've handled Hitler?&quot; &quot;It would've been easier 
      for Gandhi to handle him, actually,&quot; he replied. &quot;Just as you 
      can't see the lights in the evening but can see them brightly in total darkness, 
      the message of nonviolence would've easily worked in the total darkness 
      of Hitler's Germany.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Please 
      open the pages of the Book of Jeremiah the Prophet, in Central Europe, on 
      the morning of the 20th century)</font>. </p>
    <p>Well, then, how can we bring non-violence to the middle-east? &quot;Why 
      aren't you asking how can we bring non-violence to America?&quot; Dwarko 
      asserted promptly. &quot;Everyone needs non-violence. And it starts with 
      you. Are you non-violent?&quot;</p>
    <p>Deafening silence. </p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>Then, he elaborated on Gandhi's seven blunders of the world: wealth without 
      work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce 
      without morality, science without humanity, worship without sacrifice, politics 
      without principle.</p>
    <p>It has been thousands of years since Jesus Christ said, &quot;Love thy 
      neighbor as thyself.&quot; In fact, that golden rule has been proclaimed 
      by every major religion. Gandhi also told us, &quot;It is no nonviolence 
      if we merely love those who love us. It is nonviolence only when we love 
      those who hate us.&quot;</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>As easy and utopian as it sounds, it's not. Someone asked Dwarko, &quot;What 
      were Gandhi's weaknesses?&quot; And he quickly responded: &quot;Gandhi had 
      many many weaknesses. But he had one strength -- when he found truth, he 
      wouldn't let it go.&quot; </p>
    &quot;A saint is a sinner who never gave up,&quot; Yogananda once said. All 
    of a sudden it hits home that you're sitting in front of a saint. </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font size="+1">It was thoroughly fitting that Margrit Kennedy (<i>Interest 
    and Inflation Free Money: Creating an Exchange Medium that Works for Everybody 
    and Protects the Earth)</i> followed Dwarko Sundrani to the podium, because--perhaps 
    without knowing it herself--she opened the Door to an understanding of this 
    entire subject when she allowed God (the Divine Mother) into the human equation. 
    She spoke of Jung's missing archetype--the Goddess, the Divine Feminine Principle 
    of Life. We find Her (the <i>Shekinah</i> as She is known in Hebrew terminology), 
    in Genesis descending to the words: <i>In the beginning God created </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(transformed 
    Themselves into)</font><font size="+1"><i> the heaven </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Uranus)</font><font size="+1"><i> 
    and the earth </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Gaia)</font><font size="+1">...(Genesis 
    1:1). And then, as the Vedic age dawns upon the earth (after the judgment 
    wars of Noah's time), we find Her in India in the figure of Sarasvati, the 
    Goddess of Wisdom and consort of Brahma (Proverbs, chapter 8...KJV). And then 
    She appears in the Torah as Sara(h), the wife (and sister) of Abraham (Abrahm), 
    and finally in the Gospels as <i>the Woman</i> <i>who hid leaven in Three 
    measures of meal until the whole was leavened</i>. (Matthew 13:33,34; Genesis 
    18:1-6). And at last we find Her in the 12th chapter of Revelation, as it 
    is written:</font></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, 
      and pained to be delivered...</font></i><font size="+1">(Revelation 12:1,2...KJV). 
      </font></p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font size="+1">Just as She (Divine Wisdom--Sophia) revealed Herself to the 
    spiritual adepts of those times, and gave birth to the age in which we presently 
    reside, so She is descending once again into our collective field of consciousness 
    and is giving birth to another (the Aquarian) age. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In a workshop shared with Tom Kennedy, Verne Warwick and 
    Richard Kotlarz, who were in turn eloquent in their understanding of the effects 
    of the plague of usury upon the life of the planet, we attempted to put the 
    subject of usury (and therefore the theory of capitalism) in its proper historical 
    perspective. (And let us agree, before we get tangled in what might seem to 
    some like a simplistic and wholesale condemnation of everything that is also 
    obviously good about Western civilization, that not only are there many good 
    people--millions in fact, like Jonah--who are laboring righteously, for true 
    justice here in the West, doing the best they can inside of a system that 
    is very dark, but that it is the Darkness itself that has facilitated this 
    birth of Light. Thus it is all the work of Divine Wisdom). We reasoned, that 
    since the beginning of this age and the birth of Christianity two primary 
    theories of history have affected and guided the philosophy and <i>westward</i> 
    expansion of civilization. The first we attributed to Saint Augustine. (We 
    recalled that Augustine also laid the theological groundwork for the future 
    <i>Inquisitions</i>, gave the church its disdain for womankind, and authored, 
    along with others, the pernicious idea of the <i>Just War</i>). </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Augustine's theory of history implied that everything written 
    in the past was already fulfilled, with the coming of Christ and the rise 
    of the Christianity in the earth. The Caesars (and not the present rulers 
    of the Western world) were the antichrists, which the Church has either already 
    deposed, or will, in time, render subject to the rule of Christ). The key 
    to understanding his theory (and therefore the theory of the subsequently 
    all-powerful Roman Catholic order, and the Reformation order that emerged 
    out of it) are the words, <i>in time</i>. The theory holds that history, and 
    therefore reality, has no definite structure, no pattern to guide our lives 
    by other than the <i>ex-cathedra</i> teachings of Holy Mother Church. It is 
    an open book, linear in its dimension, and will come to its conclusions at 
    some undetermined, far-off juncture in time, way out there in the future, 
    after Christendom has finally subdued all of the <i>pagan</i> and otherwise 
    wayward impulses of humankind. Until then, of course, everyone has a crack 
    at it, everyone has the right, and even the duty, to attempt to establish 
    their own worldview. The chosen, and by this implication the strongest, will 
    prevail. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">This, of course, was the Deist position on history, those 
    who founded the American Capitalist Order. It holds that God set the world 
    in motion, but it is up to us--to <i>man</i>--to establish the world in righteousness, 
    using the power of <i>human reason</i> that has been bequeathed to us at the 
    creation. (This despite every edict in the sacred texts against the abilities 
    of the natural mind). We recalled when Newt Gingrich introduced Alvin Toffler 
    and his work, <i>The Third Wave</i>, on the floor of the U.S. Congress. This 
    was a subtle attempt at the time to co-opt, or assimilate the power of the 
    Third Wave (the Age of Information) that is now sweeping over the globe. The 
    First Wave was the age of hunter-gatherers, basic agriculture and village 
    life. It lasted for thousands of years, yielding ever so slowly, and almost 
    imperceptibly to the Dialectic effect. Then the Second Wave, the Industrial 
    Age, suddenly inundated the world, sweeping over First Wave societies like 
    a torrential flood. The conflict between the two is still being waged in certain 
    parts of the world, including America. Second Wave society--short-lived as 
    it was--is now locked in a life-and-death struggle to maintain its control, 
    not only over the vast resources of the earth, over the world's industrial 
    economy, but also over the ideas that will ultimately determine the direction 
    the world's people will take once they have the information to go on. &quot;It 
    is too late,&quot; Michael Burisch, a friend from Vienna, said, &quot;They 
    have no idea what they did, what power they let loose, when they put this 
    little contraption (the computer and the internet) in our hands.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Likewise is Malachi Martin's <i>The Keys of This Blood, The 
    Struggle for World Dominion Between Pope John Paul II, Mikhail Gorbachev, 
    and the Capitalist West. </i>In a chapter entitled The Grand Design, Martin 
    states that at the time of John Paul's elevation the world was divided into 
    three <i>Internationales</i>: the <i>Red Internationale </i>(which has ostensibly 
    collapsed with the Soviet Union itself), the <i>Black Internationale </i>(the 
    Roman church, which for all metaphorical purposes is as irrelevant to the 
    future course of history as the failing Pope himself), and the <i>Golden Internationale 
    </i>(the internationalists and globalists of the Capitalist West, who seem 
    at present to have won the struggle--a victory, however, that they are still 
    desperately trying to consolidate and turn into reality)...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Which brings us to the second theory of History, the one 
    that is actually unfolding in the earth at this very time. The <i>Cyclical</i>, 
    or <i>Apocalyptic </i>theory of History holds that reality moves in great 
    reoccurring cycles of events. When the Great Wheel of Time (the Great Design) 
    reaches a turning point, as it has at at other minor turning points in the 
    past, the next stage of human consciousness is reached, the old is destroyed, 
    and the new is born. This was the world view of the Essenes and that fellowship 
    of spiritual adepts who laid the (secret if you will) foundation for the age 
    of Christianity as it has come to pass. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It would be a mistake to 
      suppose that the writers of the scrolls and the men of Qumran were inspired 
      only by recollections of things past or that they chose their way of life 
      simply because they were unsettled by political turbulence or disgusted 
      by the venality of the Jerusalemitan priests. They were swept also by other 
      winds. One of these was the widespread and well-attested contemporary belief 
      that great cycle of the ages was about to complete its revolution. This 
      belief was based on a conception, which can in fact be traced to remote 
      Indian antiquity, that existence consists not in linear progressive development 
      --that is, in history </font>(although it does also)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--but 
      in a constant cyclical repetition of primordial and archetypal events. When 
      major upheavals occurred it was promptly supposed that the cycle was nearing

      to chaos. The primal elements, restrained and regulated at the beginning 
      of the world, would again be unleashed; all things would dissolve in an 
      overwhelming deluge (wars) or be burned in that everlasting fire that rages 
      in the depths of the earth. Then the cycle would begin again; a new world

<blockquote> 
  <div align="center"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Every complex society has a dilemma 
      to solve--wealth and power tend to concentrate until the divide between 
      haves and have-nots threaten the social fabric. Some Native American cultures 
      have massive give-aways (potlaches) in which the giver is honored and all 
      benefit from the largesse. The prophets of the Old Testament also cried 
      out for redistribution.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Agrarian life 
      is full of risks: drought, flooding, infestation, and other natural disasters, 
      capped throughout antiquity by wars. Farmers must often borrow to get themselves 
      through the lean months, while hoping that nothing prevents them from bringing 
      in crops that will allow them to repay their debts. In ancient times, failure 
      to repay loans could cost farmers their land, possessions, enslavement of 
      family members, or their own freedom. For millennia, the problem confronting 
      rulers was how to prevent the destabilization that occurs when large portions 
      of the population are forced off the land into debtor's prison for failure 
      to repay loans.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so there developed 
      throughout the ancient Near East a tradition of clean-slate edicts, which 
      &quot;proclaimed justice&quot; or decreed &quot;economic order&quot; and 
      &quot;righteousness&quot; by canceling debts and restoring forfeited land 
      to farmers....Eventually the tradition became known as the Jubilee Year, 
      but by that time it was taken out of the hands of kings and placed at the 
      core of Mosaic law...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The clean-slate 
      tradition was so central to Israelite moral values that it framed the composition 
      of both the Old and New Testaments. Yet so far has the modern idea of market 
      efficiency and progress gone that today, although the Bible remains our 
      civilization's defining book, its economic laws are rarely taken seriously. 
      The...Commandments and Golden Rule have become so dissociated from the economic 
      legislation of Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy that whoever takes these 
      laws in earnest is considered utopian and anachronistic...</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Yet these laws formed the 
      take-off point for Jesus upon his return to Nazareth's synagogue and for 
      his denunciation of the money changers who had taken over Jerusalem's temple. 
      As recently as medieval Spain, the tradition of the Jubilee Year was kept 
      alive by Jewish sages. To dismiss these laws was to remove much of the Bible 
      from the context of its times </font>(as well as our times)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Laws that periodically cancelled 
      debts, freed Israelite debt-servants, and returned lands to their traditional 
      holders have confused Biblical students for centuries. They have long been 
      virtually ignored by historians on the ground that, to modern eyes, they 
      would seem to wreak economic havoc...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus later sought to restore 
      the (ordinances) by overturning the banking tables in Jerusalem's temple 
      and preaching anew the promise of Jeremiah to proclaim equity and liberty 
      throughout the land. Indeed, it was specifically on this principle of restoring 
      freedom to debt-slaves and unburdening the land that Christianity elaborated 
      its ideas of redemption. In addition to redeeming souls, early Christians 
      redeemed their co-religionists from worldly bondage. When Handel staged 
      the first performance of his Messiah in Dublin in 1742, it was no coincidence 
      that the proceeds were used to free debtors from prison. For thousands of 
      years, redeeming people and land from debt was the primary and most concrete 
      form of redemption. When Christians pronounce <i>Hallelujah</i>, the repeat 
      the ritual term <i>alulu</i>, chanted upon the freedom of Babylonian debt-slaves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Echoes of the doctrine can also 
      be heard in American tradition. The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia is inscribed 
      with a quotation from Leviticus 25:10: <i>Proclaim liberty throughout all 
      the land, and to all the inhabitants thereof</i>...</font></p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font size="+1">This is where we must exercise extreme maturity in our interpretation 
    of history. The founders of the American order borrowed (stole) the phrase 
    from sacred writ, but never freed a soul. Instead, began (or rather continued), 
    the systematic process of genocide, land stealing, and the gradual enslavement 
    of future generations in the New Secular Order. Open the pages of the Book 
    of Isaiah. The American nation was founded in absolute violation of the teachings 
    of the Law and the Prophets (not in violation of the Law itself mind you, 
    but of the teachings of the Law, for the higher Law necessitated the existence 
    of America, so that the Light could be born out of it). </font></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The full verse in Leviticus 
      speaks of freeing debt bondsmen and freeing the land from debt generally:

      and to all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a Jubilee unto you, and 
      ye shall return every man unto his family</i>. </font></p>

<div align="left">
  <p><font size="+1">Whether this statement is correct or not, we do know what 
    happened to Rome. And we do know what happened to the Holy Roman Empire that 
    succeeded it. We watched it collapse before our very eyes in the First and 
    Second judgment wars of the 20th century. And those with <i>the sight </i>can 
    plainly see what is about to happen in the world today.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">During the closing hours of the conference, when everyone 
    was invited to offer some parting thoughts, we shared those of a seven-year 
    old girl from West Virginia, Kalila Baker. Her's were fitting words to end 
    a conference on Alternative Local Economies. Kalila went with her family a 
    year or so before to a Rainbow Family gathering at the Upper Peninsular in 
    Michigan. The gathering has been held continuously, at a different national 
    forest every year, since the early 1970s. Thousands come together every summer 
    to recreate, however temporary, a model of a true communal society. (Creative 
    and submissive anarchy, and nonviolence, are the guiding principles). In the 
    weeks leading up to the fourth of July the village (a mile or two long at 
    times) takes shape, small bridges are built (and disassembled again after 
    the gathering...everything is returned to the way it was), free kitchens are 
    set up, fruitful conversation and music fill the air, and the sound of &quot;Welcome 
    Home&quot; is heard everywhere throughout the village. The point here is that, 
    though American dollars are used in the local towns to purchase foodstuff 
    and other supplies for the kitchens they are not used anywhere inside the 
    gathering itself. All commerce inside the village is conducted either through 
    time sharing or direct barter, and as often as not things and necessities, 
    as well as labor, are just given away for nothing. &quot;What goes around, 
    comes around&quot; is a sound economic principle, and functions almost effortlessly 
    wherever the heart and the mind of the people are in alignment. Kalila, not 
    knowing the ways of the Rainbow Family Gathering, set off down the main trail 
    with her sisters and brothers with some dollars in her pocket and a handful 
    of change, hoping to trade for some of the beautiful items (jewelry and other 
    things) that were on display along the way. About an hour later she came back 
    to the tent, took all of the money out of her pocket and threw it on the ground. 
    She said, &quot;Mom, this stuff is no good around here.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">(She later figured it out, and went down the trail again 
    with some little things that she made herself, and with a determination to 
    trade some labor, and came home with a pocket full of bead works and bracelets). 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Perhaps the most fitting way to end this essay is to share 
    the lesson I learned from Chris Lindstrom's mother, Abbey Rockefeller. During 
    a conversation together one afternoon I used the word <i>nature</i>, carelessly 
    now that I understand it. &quot;That's a bad word,&quot; she said, &quot;and 
    nothing will ever change until we stop using it.&quot; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 
    I asked. &quot;We always use that word as if Nature was something else,&quot; 
    she said. &quot;There is no sense of Oneness between ourselves and all that 
    exists, when we define all that exists as something different from ourselves.&quot; 
    What she said rang true, after all what are we but a wholly magical arrangement 
    of...well, water and earth, fire and air. We are created out of...<i>Nature</i>. 
    &quot;Our use of that word,&quot; she explained, &quot;leaves room, even ever 
    so slightly, to imagine ourselves to be separate, or above, or removed from 
    the reality of our own existence. It is impersonal and leaves room for disrespect, 
    and opens an opportunity in our minds for misuse and exploitation.&quot; I 
    understood exactly what she was saying, and will try in the future not to 
    use that word, at least not in that way. It will be difficult at times, however, 
    like finding another word for Mother, or Father, or God.</font></p>

  <div align="center"> 
    <p>THEY FLED MAINSTREAM SOCIETY TO LIVE IN COMMUNES, BUT NOW MANY UTOPIANS 
      EMBRACE CAPITALISM AS A TOOL OF SURVIVAL</p>
    <p>By Anne-Marie O'Connor</p>
    <p>Los Angeles Times</p>
    <p align="left">Albert Bates grows nostalgic remembering the freewheeling 
      days when hundreds of hippies left Haight-Ashbury in a caravan of psychedelic 
      buses for a celebrated back-to-the-land pilgrimage. Bates was a law student 
      when this electric circus rolled through New York in 1970, and he found 
      it irresistible. Soon he followed, joining a young affluent exodus to the 
      American countryside that would be one of the most profound social experiments 
      of its time.</p>
    <p align="left">His long hair and beard have grayed, but Bates still lives 
      on The Farm, the storied American commune he helped build in backwoods Tennessee. 
      Sipping Mystic Brew organic coffee at its eco-village, he chuckles at the 
      memory of the trippy energy that once inspired some communards to boot up 
      their Macintoshes and design a Geiger counter they sold, for almost nothing, 
      as a dashboard ornament for anti-nuke protesters.&quot;It was a novelty 
      item, but it turned out to be very accurate,&quot; Bates says with a grin. 
      &quot;It was pretty funny.&quot; </p>
    <p align="left">The homegrown Nuke-Buster is no joke now. Today, the computerized, 
      satellite-accessible nuclear detectors are used worldwide by police, military, 
      firefighters and federal disaster officials. They are used to stem nuclear 
      contraband at the borders that Belarus and Kazakhistan share with Russia. 
      Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, sales have risen 30 percent, to 
      $2.5 million last year. The Farm-based manufacturer has been commended by 
      the U.S. Department of Commerce. Not bad for a place that spent years under 
      FBI surveillance.</p>
    <p align="left">HIGH-TECH HIPPIES</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;Homeland Security's been good to us. We're high-tech 
      hippies now,&quot; says Stephen Gaskin, the charismatic former San Francisco 
      State University lecturer who was once the Farm's guru, preaching a long-abandoned 
      doctrine of multiple-partner marriage and marijuana spiritualism. &quot;WE 
      HAD TO FIND WAYS TO SURVIVE,&quot; echoed Bates, &quot;IN THE MATERIAL WORLD.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">Hundreds of American utopian communities face the same challenge. 
      A surprising number are thriving. BUT IF AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WERE ONCE, 
      IN THE EYES OF JOAN DIDION, &quot;SLOUCHING TOWARD BETHLEHEM,&quot; MANY 
      TODAY LEAN CLOSER TO MERRILL LYNCH. TIE-DYE, WOOD-BURNING STOVES AND MANDALAS 
      STILL ABOUND. BUT SO DO MULTIMILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES AND FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING

<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>THEY MAY HAVE DROPPED OUT OF MAINSTREAM SOCIETY TO LIVE A UTOPIAN DREAM, 
      BUT NOW THEY EMBRACE CAPITALISM AS A TOOL OF SURVIVAL, ON THEIR OWN TERMS. 
      Most, including The Farm, no longer define themselves as communes, describing 
      themselves as collectives, cooperatives and egalitarian communities. </p>
    <p>More than 600 such settlements in the United States are listed in the directory 
      of the Fellowship for Intentional Community. The Fellowship's executive 
      secretary, Laird Schaub, estimates that at least 10,000 Americans live in 
      rural collectives. That population could climb as high as 150,000 when religion-based 
      cooperative communities--such as the Hutterites, who do not believe in private 
      property--are factored in, according to University of Kansas religion professor 
      Tim Miller, who studies communal life.</p>
    <p>People in their 20s and 30s still join collectives, but more newcomers 
      than ever before are older than 50, Schaub said. &quot;There's a surge,&quot; 
      said Schaub, a member of the 30-year-old Sandhill commune in Rutledge, Mo. 
      &quot;We've been astounded at how easy it is to get summer interns who want 
      to learn about organic farming. We have to turn them away.&quot;</p>
    <p>The communities produce industrial strength quantities of organic nut butters, 
      artisanal cheeses, vegetables, tofu, hammocks, commercial vegetable and 
      flower seeds--even a desert wine endorsed by European wine snobs. Virginia's 
      Twin Oaks produces hammocks for Pier One. The nut butters produced by a 
      Missouri commune, East Wind, supply such mainstream chains as Whole Foods 
      and Wild Oats, whose stores also market Sandhill's organic sorghum. In a 
      region where family farms have become an endangered species, organic farms 
      such as Sandhill are lauded by the Missouri Department of Agriculture Web 
      page as possible models for survival.</p>
    <p>Some communities, like Harbin Hot Springs, in the Northern California town 
      of Middleton, host paying tourists with such amenities as hikes and shiatsu 
      massage. Inisfree, in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, runs a boarding school 
      for disabled children, another community has a summer camp for urban kids. 
      Sunrise Ranch in Colorado runs a conference and retreat center, a growing 
      source of income. The communities have slick Web sites, marketing directors, 
      federations, group health plans, hot lines, magazines, conventions and thick 
      directories filled with romantic names...that evoke an ocean of idyllic 
      yearning.</p>
    <p>INVITING THE WORLD IN</p>
    <p>Far from retreating from society, many invite the world in. Last year the 
      Findhorn community is Scotland hosted a UN-affiliated environmental conference. 
      The Farm started its own UN-recognized international relief agency called 
      Plenty. </p>
    <p>Yet at many communities, the graying elders are soul-searching as they 
      ponder who will carry on their legacy. People interested in living there 
      permanently are often aging 60s veterans who are among the 74 million baby 
      boomers making the transition to senior citizenhood. Even at the venerable 
      Farm, hundreds of commune-born children have grown up and moved to Nashville, 
      New York or California. Few return to live at the end of this dirt track, 
      past the farmhouse where the Confederate flag flaps in the breeze. </p>
    <p>&quot;There are people who need to see their children come back here, as 
      an affirmation that what they did has legs,&quot; said Cynthia Holzapfel, 
      the managing editor of the $1-million-a-year Farm-based Book Publishing 
      Co., which has had several bestsellers: &quot;Spiritual Midwifery,&quot; 
      &quot;Tofu Cookery&quot; and :Defeating Diabetes.&quot; &quot;I'm a little 
      more Buddhist about it. We've built it If they're going to come, they're 
      going to come,&quot; said Holzapfel. </p>
    <p>Capitalism wasn't the only thing that happened to The Farm along the road 
      to Utopia. The commune engaged in a collective divorce in 1982, firing its 
      charismatic leader, Gaskin. Homes that once housed 60 people were given 
      to single families, and residents were required to contribute $135 a month 
      to the community foundation. The bitter exodus that ensued downsized The 
      Farm from a 1,500-strong commune to a 200-member cooperative today.</p>
    <p>That divisive rupture, like The Farm's ragtag infancy, is difficult to 
      envision in the serene pastoral landscape beyond the pamphlet-filled visitors' 
      center. Rustic wood-frame homes nestle in the trees and sun-bleached grasses 
      of gentle hills, reminiscent of Northern California's Marin County...</p>
    <p>A COUNTERCULTURE UNIVERSE</p>
    <p>In those days 10,000 people visited The Farm a year. Most crashed for a 
      few days, but about 1,500 stayed on to create a self-contained counterculture 
      universe, complete with clinic, an ambulance service and a commune-wide 
      phone system dubbed &quot;Beatnick Bell.&quot; All money earned outside 
      was handed over to The Farm. By 1982 many of these norms were being challenged. 
      People were tired of being poor and wanted to keep their wages.</p>
    <p>&quot;People said, 'Why should he have that much authority?'&quot; said 
      Phil Schweitzer, co-director of The Farm's Media Village, a video production 
      business. &quot;We were now in our 30s, and we didn't want a charismatic 
      leader.&quot; Gaskin was fired and the new trustees demanded cash dues. 
      Hundreds left. Those who stayed after &quot;the Changeover&quot; began creating 
      private businesses. When Carter-era subsidies for solar energy dried up, 
      high-tech Farmies turned instead to radiation detectors.</p>
    <p> Today, SE International, now a private company, is among the most lucrative 
      businesses on The Farm. Its modular office park, decorated with soft blues 
      and modern art, hums with activity. Men with long graying ponytails sit 
      on large ergonomic balls, meticulously wiring board circuitry...</p>
    <p>At The Farm, intimacy is a fact not an option. Old grudges dating from 
      the Changeover resurface. Former spouses work side by side. For Holzapfel, 
      the deep kinship is a contrast to the alienation and anonymity that dog 
      some of her friends in mainstream America. &quot;We have preserved a lot 
      of old fashioned values,&quot; she said. &quot;People today feels so disposable. 
      We don't feel that way here. IF YOU FACE HARD TIMES, YOU'RE MORE LIKELY 
      TO CUT YOUR OWN PAYCHECK THAN LAY PEOPLE OFF.&quot;</p>
    <p>HIPPIE RETIREMENT HOME?</p>
    <p>Yet the future still poses a question. Farm leadership wants to attract 
      young families, BUT BANKS WILL NOT EXTEND LOANS FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES 
      WITHOUT INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY TITLES. The Farm is considering building rental 
      housing; otherwise, &quot;I can imagine The Farm becoming an old hippie 
      retirement home,&quot; Schweitzer said. &quot;I'd hate to see that happen.&quot; 
      Gaskin has his own solution: He is building retirement cabins for an elder 
      village he call Rosinante, the name of the bony, aging horse of Don Quixote, 
      who was famed for tilting at windmills and embracing lost causes...</p>
    <p>The Farm may have relinquished the free-floating exuberance of youth, BUT 
      PERHAPS IT HAS ACQUIRED AN EQUALLY VALUABLE IDEALISM OF ANOTHER VINTAGE. 
      &quot;NOW THE FARM HAS THE WISDOM OF OLDER PEOPLE,&quot; said Douglas Stevenson, 
      the 30-year Farm veteran who steered the Swan Creek Project to fruition. 
      THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE HELPS GUIDE YOU TO SUCCESS. IT'S ONE THING WE DIDN''T 
      HAVE IN THE OLD DAYS.&quot; </p>

      Well...pretty impressive (wishing I was able to be there), only one little 
      (thing) that didn't rest well in my mind.. While reading through this...I 
      thought it to be great..But!!...it struck me as odd that here was a CONFERENCE 
      ON LOCAL AND ALTERNATIVE CURRENCIES.. And it COST how much(?) to attend 
      ? The conference could have been more suited being held in an open field..or 
      maybe an old abandoned wharehouse somewhere... why not? I think it would 
      have been more affective..more powerful to live your message as Gandhi would 
      say &quot;My life is my message.&quot;Think about it..Who were (they) getting 
      the message across to? Already believers..Next CONFERENCE should be open 
      to the WHOLE (to everyone)...as in COMMUNITY (break it down..UNITY) not 
      just those who can afford it... like share the &quot;APPLE&quot; the forbidden 
      fruit..Like pass the cup around please... Am I making sense? Just my thoughts 
      but...Well it's late..or is it early? <br>
      <br>
      Anyways I DID enjoy all the positive thoughts..and am so looking forward 
      to living in COMMUNITY where self no longer needs to be put first to survive. 
      I can hardly wait for the New Day where people (all of Humanity) learn to 
      live together in Unity..peace and LOVE..<br>
      <br>
      Okay.. I'm going to bed..I love you ..always</p>

    <p align="left">Do you think it was? Really? I was not trying to be mean..It's 
      just that words from the heart, are like water, they nourish the trees, 
      the land. Everything that IS should be free, free for all not just for those 
      with money. I don't know dad..Maybe it's a silly thought that makes no sense..Please 
      don't pass this along unless you agree...Because &quot;I'm not a smart man 
      , but I do know what love is..(Jenny)!!&quot; <br>

      Much love..<br>
