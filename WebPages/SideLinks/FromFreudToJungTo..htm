<blockquote> 
  <p>A REMARKABLE NEW VIEW OF REALITY, THE BRAIN AS A HOLOGRAM</p>
  <p>&quot;Sit down before fact like a little child, and be prepared to give up 
    every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and whatever abyss Nature 
    leads, or you shall learn nothing.&quot; <font size="2">T.H. Huxley</font>.</p>
  <p>&quot;It isn't that the world of appearances is wrong; it isn't that there 
    aren't objects out there, <i>at one level of reality</i>. It is that if you 
    penetrate through and look at the universe with a holographic system, you 
    arrive at a different view, a different reality. And that other reality can 
    explain things that have hitherto remained inexplicable scientifically: paranormal 
    phenomena, synchronicities, the apparent meaningful coincidence of events.&quot;

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If matter and consciousness 
    are both types of gravitational fields, they are like different ripples in 
    the same pond…what goes on in the consciousness affects the whole universe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And now we must suspect that every 
    point in the human brain is connected, via </font>(what he calls)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    the quantum foam </font>(the underlying fabric of all creation)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    to every other point in the universe.&quot; </font>Mysticism and the New Physics, 
    by Michael Talbot, pp.62, 81<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sir James Jean's notion of 
    the universe as a giant Thought as opposed to a giant machine is further echoed 
    in quantum physics. Jack Sarfatti states, 'signals move through constantly 
    appearing and disappearing (virtual) wormhole connections providing almost 
    instant communication between all parts of space. These signals can be likened 
    to pulses of nerve cells of a great cosmic brain that permeates all parts 
    of space. This point of view is motivated by Einstein's general relativity 
    in the form of Geometrodynamics. A parallel point of view is given in the 
    quantum theory as interpreted by Bohm. In my opinion this is no accident because 
    I suspect that general relativity and quantum theory are simply two complimentary 
    aspects of a deeper theory that will involve a kind of Cosmic Consciousness 
    as the key concept.'&quot; </font>Talbot, p.82</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;During their conversations 
    (David Bohm and Albert Einstein) the two men discovered they each had nothing 
    but admiration for the theory's ability to predict phenomena. What bothered 
    them was that it provided no real way of conceiving of the basic structure 
    of the world. Niels Bohr and his followers also claimed that quantum theory 
    was complete and it was not possible to arrive at any clearer understanding 
    of what was going on in the quantum realm. This was the same as saying there 
    was no deeper reality beyond the subatomic landscape, no further answers to 
    be found, and this too grated on both Bohm and Einstein's philosophical sensibilities...Inspired 
    by his interactions with Einstein, he accepted the validity of his misgivings 
    about quantum physics and decided there had to be an alternative view...His 
    mind, ever active and always looking for deeper explanations, was already 
    searching for a better way of describing reality.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A NEW KIND OF FIELD...After his 
    talks with Einstein, Bohm tried to find a workable alternative to Bohr's interpretation. 
    He began by assuming that particles such as electrons do exist in the absence 
    of observers. He also assumed that there was a deeper reality beneath Bohr's 
    inviolable wall, a subquantum level that still awaited its discovery by science. 
    Building on these premises he discovered that simply by proposing the existence 
    of a new kind of field on this subquantum level he was able to explain the 
    findings of quantum physics as well as Bohr could. Bohm called his proposed 
    new field the <i>quantum potential</i> and theorized that, like gravity, it 
    pervaded all of space. However, unlike gravitational fields, magnetic fields, 
    and so on, its influence did not diminish with distance. Its effects were 
    subtle, but it was equally powerful everywhere. Bohm published his alternative 
    interpretation of quantum theory in 1952.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reaction to his new approach was 
    mainly negative. Some physicists were so convinced such alternatives were 
    impossible that they dismissed the ideas his ideas out of hand. </font>(Theologians 
    are that way too)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Others launched 
    passionate attacks against his reasoning. In the end virtually all such arguments 
    were based primarily on philosophical differences, but it did not matter. 
    Bohr's point of view had become so entrenched in physics that Bohm's alternative 
    was looked upon as little more than heresy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the harshness of these 
    attacks Bohm remained unswerving in his convictions that there was more to 
    reality than Bohr's view would allow. He also felt that science was much too 
    limited in its outlook when it came to assessing new ideas such as his own, 
    and in a 1957 book entitled <i>Causality and Chance in Modern Physics</i>, 
    he examined several of the philosophical suppositions responsible for this 
    attitude. One was the widely held assumption that it was possible for any 
    single theory, such as quantum theory, to be complete. Bohm criticized this 
    assumption by pointing out that Nature might be infinite. Because it would 
    not be possible for any theory to completely explain something that is infinite, 
    Bohm suggested that open scientific inquiry might be better served if researchers 
    refrained from making this assumption.&quot; </font>The Holographic Universe, 
    by Michael Talbot, pp.39,40<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Such skepticism notwithstanding, 
    there are also physicists who are sympathetic to Bohm's ideas, including such 
    big guns as Roger Penrose of Oxford, the creator of the modern theory of the 
    black hole; Bernard d'Espagnat of the University of Paris, one of the world's 
    leading authorities on the conceptual foundations of quantum theory; and Cambridge's 
    Brian Josephson, winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in physics. Josephson believes 
    Bohm's implicate order may someday even lead to the inclusion of God or Mind 
    within the framework of science, an idea Josephson supports.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Considered together, Bohm and (Karl) 
    Pribram's theories provide a profound new way of looking at the world: 'Our 
    brains mathematically construct objective reality by interpreting frequencies 
    that are ultimately projections from another dimension, a deeper order of 
    existence that is beyond both space and time. The brain is a hologram enfolded 
    in a holographic universe.'&quot; </font>The Holographic Universe, p.54<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The holographic idea also 
    sheds light on the unexplainable linkages that can sometimes occur between 
    the consciousnesses of two or more individuals. One of the most famous examples 
    of such linkages is embodied in Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung's concept of 
    a collective unconscious. Early in his career Jung became convinced that the 
    dreams, artwork, fantasies, and hallucinations of his patients often contained 
    symbols and ideas that could not be explained entirely as products of their 
    personal history. Instead, such symbols more closely resembled the images 
    and themes of the world's great mythologies and religions. Jung concluded 
    that myths, dreams, hallucinations, and religious visions all spring from 
    the same source, a collective unconscious that is shared by all people.&quot; 
    </font>The Holographic Universe, pp.59, 60<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Moreover, such dreams were 
    not one-time occurrences. During the course of his practice (Montague) Ullman 
    noticed that when one of his patients failed to recognize or accept some truth 
    about himself, that truth would surface again and again in his dreams, in 
    different metaphorical guises and linked with different related experiences 
    from his past, but always in an apparent attempt to offer him new opportunities 
    to come to terms with the truth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because a man can ignore the counsel 
    of his dreams and still live to be a hundred, Ullman believes this self-monitoring 
    process is striving for more than just the welfare of the individual. He believes 
    that Nature is concerned with the survival of the species. He also agrees 
    with Bohm on the importance of wholeness and feels that dreams are Nature's 
    way of trying to counteract our seemingly unending compulsion to fragment 
    the world. &quot;An individual can disconnect from all that's cooperative, 
    meaningful, and loving and still survive, but nations don't have that luxury. 
    Unless we learn how to overcome all the ways we've fragmented the human race, 
    nationally, religiously, economically, or whatever, we are going to continue 
    to find ourselves in a position where we can accidentally destroy the whole 
    picture.' says Ullman. &quot;The only way we can do that is to look at how 
    we fragment our existence as individuals. Dreams reflect our individual experience, 
    but I think that's because there's a greater underlying need to preserve the 
    species, to maintain species-connectedness.&quot;</font></p>

    6:4).</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is the source of the unending 
    flow of wisdom that bubbles up in our dreams? Ullman admits that he doesn't 
    know, but he offers a suggestion. Given that the implicate order represents 
    in a sense an infinite information source, PERHAPS IT IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS 
    GREATER FUND OF KNOWLEDGE. Perhaps dreams are a bridge between the perceptual 
    and nonmanifest orders </font>(between man and God)?<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    and represent a &quot;natural transformation of the implicit into the explicit.&quot; 
    If Ullman is correct in this supposition it stands the traditional psychoanalytic 
    view of dreams on its ear, for instead of dream content being something that 
    ascends into consciousness from a primitive substratum of the personality, 
    quite the opposite would be true.</font></p>
