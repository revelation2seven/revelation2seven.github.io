<p>&quot;How can you believe in astrology?,&quot; my devout Christian friends 
  have asked me. I tell them that astrology is not a belief system, but an archetypal, 
  poetic language. I don't ask you if you believe in Japanese. I ask if you speak 
  it. I don't ask you if you believe in music, I ask if you play it. I happen 
  to speak the heavenly tongue of astrology along with thousands of other highly 
  intelligent, inspiring, spiritual and even scientific astrologers.</p>
<p>Their skepticism persists due to what they've been taught about the Bible and 
  so I decide to go into their home field and initiate the conversation about 
  Biblical insights into astrology, one of my favorite topics.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bible totally supports the practice of astrology,&quot; I boldly 
  claim staring into horrified eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;That's crazy,&quot; they say. &quot;Astrology is the work of the Devil. 
  You don't need the stars to direct your life, you just need Jesus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, even Jesus respected the wisdom of the heavens,&quot; I say. &quot;Let 
  me see your Bible. I'll show you proof that astrology is a divinely bestowed 
  gift to humanity.&quot; I open to the Psalms and begin reading verse 19:1-3, 
  &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God. The skies proclaim the work of his 
  hands. Day after day they pour forth speech. Night after night they display 
  knowledge. There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds to me like the heavens are supposed to speak, to declare 
  insights, reveal knowledge and that no language even exists that does not contain 
  the voice of the heavens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, so one Psalm by King David says the heavens speak.God can speak 
  through anything: people, places, events. It doesn't mean we have to govern 
  our lives by the stars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, it does indicate that we can have a conversation with eternal being 
  through the motions of the heavens. The Bible speaks clearly about the purpose 
  of the sun, moon and stars.&quot; I open to Genesis 1:14-18. </p>
<p>And God said, let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide 
  the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days 
  and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give 
  light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater 
  light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars 
  also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the 
  earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from 
  the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There you have it. Even in the King James Version. When I interpret charts 
  I illuminate for clients their potential, both shadow and light, to help them 
  accept their whole being and to help them live the full expression of their 
  gifts. We also probe and improve on their weaknesses. When I look at the transits 
  and progressions, I explain the qualities and potential of the seasons, days 
  and years, giving guidance based on the motions and cycles of heavenly bodies 
  reflecting psychological states and the flow of events. My aim is not to predict 
  the future, but to help people live more fully in the present, navigating the 
  currents of life with skill. We all have heard that to everything under the 
  sun there is a season (Ecclesiastes 3:1-10). In Psalms 104:19 it says, &quot;The 
  moon marks off the seasons and the sun knows when to set.&quot; When I read 
  a chart, whether it's for a person, city, nation, or event, I am using the heavens 
  as the Bible says, to read the signs.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow,&quot; the person says, still dismayed by my intense faith in astrology. 
  &quot;That's interesting.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;That's just the beginning,&quot; I continue. &quot;Let's see how deep 
  the rabbit hole goes. My study of astrology has given vital proof of divine 
  intelligence behind the universe.&quot;</p>
<p>Mazzaroth, The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac</p>
<p>In Job, God asked his humble servant a series of questions involving the wondrous 
  miracles performed. In Job 38:31-33, God asks, &quot;Can you bind the sweet 
  influences of the Pleiades or loose the bonds of Orion? Can you bring forth 
  the Mazzaroth in their seasons? Or can you guide Arcturus with his sons? Do 
  you know the principles of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the 
  earth?&quot;</p>
<p>Thus, God is proclaiming that there are principles in the heavens and that 
  they govern life on earth. Furthermore, God is responsible for bringing forth 
  the Mazzaroth in their seasons. Most Bibles avoid translating this sacred word, 
  Mazzaroth, because it literally means &quot;the twelve signs of the zodiac&quot; 
  in Hebrew. So, God created the zodiac and brings them forth in their seasons. 
  He explains that heavenly constellations like the Pleiades and Orion have influences 
  that can be unleashed.</p>
<p>We don't have to be afraid of signs from the heavens. God speaks through them. 
  In Judges 5:20 it describes the stars in battle. &quot;They fought from the 
  heaven. The stars in their courses fought against Ciceria.&quot; In Jeremiah 
  10:2 it says, &quot;&#133;do not be dismayed by signs from heaven.&quot; We 
  need to be open to the realization of messages in the heavens. In Psalms 136:7-9, 
  it says, &quot;Who made the great lights? His love endures forever; the sun 
  to govern the day, the moon and stars to govern the night.&quot; In Psalms 147:3-4 
  it says, &quot;God heals the broken hearted and binds up their wounds. He determines 
  the number of stars and calls them each by name.&quot; The Hebrew word shem 
  means name, a mark of character, individuality, honor and authority. Stars have 
  all that, according to the Bible. Again, in Isaiah 40:26 we hear, &quot;Lift 
  your eyes on high and behold who has created these. He who brings forth the 
  starry hosts by numbers one by one and calls them forth by character.&quot;</p>
<p>In Daniel 1:20 it says, &quot;Daniel was given divine insight by God, even 
  the ability to understand visions and dreams. In every matter of Babylonian 
  wisdom and understanding, they (Daniel and his friends) were ten times better 
  than all the magicians and enchanters in the whole kingdom.&quot; Thus, the 
  followers of the Eternal One imprisoned in a land of astrologers cultivated 
  the wisdom of the heavens that was ten times better than the average astrologer 
  of the day.</p>
<p>In Psalms 89:35-37 God says, &quot;I will not lie to David that his line will 
  continue forever and his throne endure before me like the sun. It will be established 
  forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.&quot; God describes 
  the moon here as the faithful witness in the sky. In astrology the moon governs 
  daily emotional tides and colors events and moods by its changing position. 
</p>
<p>Rahab, The Planet Between Mars and Jupiter</p>
<p>In Job (one of the oldest Biblical texts) 26:12 it says that by, &quot;God's 
  wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.&quot; Rahab is the ancient planet between Jupiter 
  and Mars, which is now an asteroid field. The ancients recorded this planet 
  in their star charts and created many myths about its mysterious destruction. 
  The content of these stories always concerned the loss of the sacred feminine. 
  In modern astrology we are attempting to heal this gap in consciousness by reintegrating 
  the feminine archetypes into our work. In the original Hebrew both the masculine 
  and feminine archetypes are equally respected and integrated into the symbols 
  of their language.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word for light used when God says, &quot;The sun, moon and stars 
  were created for giving light on the earth,&quot; is aur. The Hebrew writers 
  were well versed in the sacred language of archetypes. They were able to contemplate 
  truth through symbol as each letter of their alphabet held an archetypal meaning. 
  Aleph, the beginning letter of aur symbolizes unthinkable vibration, the sacred 
  spirit of life, infinite potential and eternal possibility. Vav, the middle 
  letter, symbolizes the process of divine fertilization emanating from the creative 
  void. Raysh, the final letter, symbolizes the hidden movement of cosmic possibility 
  as creation. Hidden in the letters of Hebrew light we discover its deeper meaning, 
  the infinite potential of the sacred spirit fertilizing creation.</p>
<p>The first line of the Bible says, &quot;In the beginning, God created the heavens 
  and the earth.&quot; When you break it down into archetypal Hebrew it means 
  the first fruits of the spirit aspiring to express eternity through a fountain 
  of divine wisdom were the creation of the celestial dimensions and the manifest 
  world. Now that casts a whole new light on Biblical translation. The Hebrew 
  word for astrologer is ashaph which breaks down to the spirit communicates through 
  the sacred flames.</p>
<p>The word aur, for light, means illumination, but also radiance, happiness and 
  joy in the original Hebrew, just as night layil also means adversity, challenge 
  and resistance. You hear the ancient root of light in words like aura, aurora, 
  our own Uranus, the planet of divine intuition and in Ur, the ancient city of 
  light, home of the legendary Abraham, father of the Hebrews in the land of Chaldea. 
</p>
<p>According to Berosus, a Chaldean historian and priest, in the tenth generation 
  after the Biblical flood there was a man among the Chaldeans (astrologers) called 
  Abram (later changed to Abraham) who mastered skill in the celestial language 
  of the heavens.[1] Close to the beginning of the Age of Aries, two millennia 
  before Christ, God called Abraham to migrate west to start the Hebrew civilization. 
</p>
<p>The Old Testament, from which I've been quoting, describes the Age of Aries 
  from the perspective of the Hebrews. Terah, who was the father of Abraham, left 
  Ur at that time. Ur was a flourishing port city, a center for trade between 
  India and Egypt. To symbolize the Age, Abraham sacrificed God's provision, the 
  ram. Across the world, bull sacrifices from the Age of Taurus were giving way 
  to ram sacrifices as the equinoxes precessed and the quality of times changed. 
  God became known as Jehovah, the warrior God, as Aries exemplifies the archetype 
  of the warrior, pioneer and leader. It was a militant age of sacred ram veneration. 
</p>
<p>The Twelve Tribes</p>
<p>Abraham was a wise spiritual seeker, but also a brave warrior. Moses later 
  became another fiery leader of this Age. They both studied the ancient sciences 
  of the Egyptians and understood that the twelve signs of the Mazzaroth were 
  the immortal thoughts of God that penetrate creation. The twelve tribes of Israel 
  (Abraham's grandsons) are associated with the twelve signs of the zodiac. According 
  to Jewish astrologers, the Hebrews accepted Deuteronomy 32:8 as proof of the 
  fact that people are divided into twelve distinct personality types. It says, 
  &quot;When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated 
  the sons of Adam, he set the boundaries of the people according to the number 
  of the tribes of Israel.&quot; In astrology twelve archetypal forces divide 
  people.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the twelve tribes were given both by Jacob in Genesis 
  49 when he blesses his sons and again in Deuteronomy 33 when Moses blesses the 
  tribes. They correspond to the basic meanings of the twelve signs used today. 
  God ordered Moses to have the twelve tribes camp around the holy tabernacle 
  in the exact order of the zodiac with the entrance to the temple facing east. 
  The four gateways to the camp were Judea, Rueben, Ephraim and Dan. These four 
  tribes correspond to the exact description in Ezekiel and Revelations of the 
  four living creatures before the throne of God, which were the lion, the bull, 
  the man and the eagle. These four ancient symbols correspond to our own astrological 
  signs of Leo, Taurus, Aquarius and Scorpio which contain the four royal stars 
  of Persia, Regulus in Leo, Aldebaran in Taurus, Formalhaut in Aquarius, Antares 
  in Scorpio.[2] God even directs Moses to have the tribes march through the desert 
  starting with Judea (Leo) and going backwards towards the camps of Rueben (Taurus), 
  Ephraim (Aquarius) and Dan (Scorpio). This is the exact motion of the equinoctial 
  precession that gives rise to the flow of the astrological ages, a 26,000-year 
  cycle. </p>
<p>Moses, like Joseph, was well versed in Egyptian astrology. As the adopted son 
  of pharaoh's daughter he was well educated in all the mystery school wisdom 
  of Egypt. The Hebrew word for Egypt is mitsuri, the land of mystery. In Acts 
  7:22 it says, &quot;Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and 
  was powerful in speech and action.&quot; He was the perfect warrior prophet 
  for the Arian age. </p>
<p>Aaron's breastplate was set with twelve sacred stones each symbolizing a Hebrew 
  tribe and thus, a zodiac sign. Joshua 4:6 says, &quot;God is remembered by twelve 
  stones in a circle.&quot; The Hebrews created elaborate rituals based on a lunar 
  calendar. In astrology New Moons symbolize beginnings and the sacred feast of 
  Israel instituted by God's commands to Moses through visions, were based on 
  the phases of the Moon. The day of the New Moon was a day of feasting and blowing 
  trumpets (Numbers 10:10). Psalms 81:3 says, &quot;Sound the ram's horn at the 
  new moon and when the moon is full, on the day of our feast.&quot; The seventh 
  New Moon was the time of the holy convocation feast and the Full Moon of this 
  month was the Feast of Tabernacles to celebrate harvest. The seventh sign in 
  astrology is Libra, symbolizing balance and love and the Full Moon symbolizes 
  illumination, vision and fulfillment, the time when emotional response is highest. 
  Passover was observed from the Full Moon to the waning quarter, a period symbolic 
  of illumination and the dissemination of truth. </p>
<p>The Age of Pisces</p>
<p>The Age of Aries gradually gave way to the next sign of the zodiac, Pisces, 
  the archetype of universal love and compassion through selfless service. The 
  three Chaldean Magi followed the star across the Arabian Desert in search of 
  the incoming spiritual master of love. Three astrologers utilized the language 
  of the heavens to discover the long-prophesized Hebrew Messiah. Modern research 
  has revealed that Jesus may have been born closer to 7 BCE around the time of 
  the Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus triple conjunction in Pisces. Every astrologer 
  inspired to research the illusive chart of Christ has a pet theory as to the 
  exact birth date. My own research lead me to conclude that he was born on September 
  16, 7 BCE around midnight in Bethlehem. In any case, the ultimate spiritual 
  mystic arrived to teach the Way as High Priest of the Order of the Melchizedek 
  (as the Bible refers to him in Hebrews 6:20).</p>
<p>Jesus embodied the Piscean archetype, linking the first sign Aries with the 
  last sign Pisces, the alpha with the omega, starting not just one new age, but 
  a whole cycle of twelve ages. People began spiritually cleansing themselves 
  through the baptismal rites, as Pisces is a water element sign. Suddenly, water 
  was sacred (as opposed to fire) and the fish became holy. Early Christians would 
  identify themselves by drawing the sign of Pisces in the sand. Jesus spoke often 
  of the age of his birth as a preparation age for the Age of Enlightenment to 
  follow. He was referring to the Age of Aquarius that is symbolized by the cosmic 
  man bearing the pitcher of the living waters of life, pouring it throughout 
  the universe. At Jesus' first Jupiter return (age 12) he began instructing the 
  Priests at the temple, saying to his parents, &quot;Let me be about my work.&quot; 
  After his first Saturn return (age 30) he became intensely devoted to teaching 
  and demonstrating the way of unconditional love. He selected twelve disciples 
  each with a character similar to one of the twelve signs. At the Last Supper 
  Jesus washed the feet of the disciples. In astrology each sign governs a part 
  of the body. Pisces symbolizes the feet. </p>
<p>The Bible is strangely silent on the so-called lost years of Jesus between 
  ages 12 and 30. Some sources like The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus[3], channeled 
  by a Christian minister at the dawn of the 20th century, tell a marlvelous story 
  about how Jesus journeyed throughout Persia, India, Greece and Egypt walking 
  all paths of life. The Christians maintain that he stayed home and humbly served 
  as a carpenter all his life until he got the call to begin his ministry.</p>
<p>The New Testament is full of clues and insights that point to Jesus' respect 
  and reverence for astrology. The most obvious quote is Luke 21:25 when he says, 
  &quot;At the end of this Age there will be signs in the sun, moon and stars&#133;the 
  heavenly bodies will be shaken.&quot; (Literally, the heavenly forces will be 
  agitated.) It's in the red print. Jesus said it. He tells his twelve disciples 
  that the age to come will be foreshadowed by signs in the heavens. That is what 
  God said they were supposed to be used for. Signs give directions and guidance 
  to help us navigate life. </p>
<p>The Age of Aquarius</p>
<p>The Age of Aquarius is surely on the rise! Astronomically, the Aries Ingress 
  won't reach the first stars of Aquarius until around 2376 CE, but the symbols 
  of Aquarius are actually alive in the imaginations of the people. Ever since 
  the discovery of Uranus in 1781 the world has been struggling for freedom, independence 
  and human rights in addition to great inventions and advances in science. In 
  the year 2080 Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus will align in the sign of Aquarius 
  similarly to the Piscean configuration of 7 BCE. On the solstice of 2020 Jupiter 
  and Saturn will conjunct in Aquarius. The times are ripe for a new dispensation 
  focused on creative originality, cosmic vision and universal awareness. The 
  next time your religious friends start bad mouthing the celestial language of 
  astrology you'll be armed with Biblical insight. </p>
<p>Astrology asks for a realization of our connection to space, divine being and 
  the process of eternal change. As an intuitive, symbolic language and art of 
  celestial cycles, it not only helps you navigate change, but also teaches you 
  to tap your creative potential. Most people think astrology is about predicting 
  the future, but really it is about diving into the unknown and living the mystery 
  each day. Astrology opens the gateway within so you can discover the sacred 
  silence and encounter the archetypes of creation. This unified spectrum of twelve 
  images symbolizes the image of eternal being. </p>
