<p><font size="+1">In our attempt to understand the Europe-Israel connection it 
  is well to consider the most obvious and first instance that reveals itself 
  from both sides of the historical records, where we find Israel ascending up 
  into Europe after the time of Moses under the collective name of Dan. Armstrong's 
  World Wide Church of God has done as much as anyone to confuse the Universal 
  Israel with the Anglo-Saxon nation-cults (imagining that they are the same), 
  but it has also added much to our studies as well. The confusion that it and 
  other American Zionist cults have created (which include certain Protestant 
  churches along with the Mormon church, which together helped spawn the Klan 
  and an Aryan mentality that presently exists throughout the nation), lies in 
  the general inability to distinguish true holiness (and true righteousness) 
  from what appears to be some certain relative, religious, and civic virtues 
  of Anglo-American culture. These virtues, of course, have only been borrowed, 
  or stolen, from the precepts of Christ themselves. It lies in everyone's general 
  inability to distinguish the true Israel (the Israel of God that is in the process 
  of being <i>Born Again</i> in our time), from the nations and empires that surround 
  it and hold it captive. The difference is critical. Armstrong's work, nevertheless, 
  helps us locate the mysteries of Israel in Europe when it associates the name 
  Dan, or D-N, with the DANube, with MaceDONia, the DON river, DANtzig, with the 
  Danes and ScanDANavia, and, perhaps foremost, with the legendary Tuatha De DANaans 
  of Ireland.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DANOS AND DANEL: 
    A MYTHOLOGICAL COMPARISON</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;An examination of the Greek 
    myths of king Danaos, an eponym of the Danaans, and of his kin may help find 
    a way toward a solution...In our approach we shall not begin by another attempt 
    to reinterpret it as an historical relation. Historical hints, preserved in 
    relics of the myth will be examined later. We should like to put the question 
    this way: If the Argive Danaans really had come from the Semitic East...then 
    this myth must have a close analogy to myths which are told in Syria, Phoenicia, 
    and Palestine, about the hero whose name the Cilician Danunians bore. According 
    to our previous conclusions, that ethnic name derives from Dan. And a hero 
    of that name actually exists among the Western Semites. This was Daniel or 
    Danel, hero of one of the W-S epic cycles discovered in the temple library 
    of Ugarit. Judging from his having been mentioned twice by Ezekiel (14:14; 
    28:3), we can assume that he had been widely known, many centuries after the 
    destruction of Ugarit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, the hypothesis that the 
    tribal name of the Danaans derives from the mythical hero Dan/Danel is corroborated 
    by the existence of another W-S tribe with the same eponym--the Israelite 
    tribe of Dan...both of whom are connected not only by their name but with 
    'judgment'--The archaic blessing of Jacob says, 'Dan will judge his people 
    as one of the tribes of Israel.' (Genesis 49:16). And Danel, sitting in the 
    threshing floor, judges the case of the widow and adjudicates the cause of 
    the fatherless. (I Aqht:24-25; 2 Aqht V.7-8)--But the second saying of the 
    blessing of Jacob on Dan (Gen.49:17) comparing him to a Serpent, is no less 
    important in understanding his character. The Serpent always was, among the 
    ancient Mediterranean peoples, the symbol of the chthonic underworld gods, 
    the givers of fertility, harvest, and healing. And Danel is just such an agrarian-chthonic 
    personage according to the Ugaritic epic. His main activity is in cornfields 
    and vineyards...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Ugaritic poem Danel's and 
    Pgt's hate of Ytpn stems from their desire for vengeance on behalf of their 
    dead son and brother. In the Greek myths this motive is replaced by the Danaides' 
    repugnance to the forced marriage to the Aigyptiads. This same motif is present 
    in the Hebrew myth of Sechem (Genesis 34), which is remarkably close to the 
    bloody wedding of the Danaides, and the heroine of which, moreover, bears 
    the almost identical name Dinah (Dina), a feminine form of Dan. Dinah is raped 
    by Sechem; he falls in love with her and, through his father Hamor, asks Jacob 
    and his sons not only to give him Dinah for a wife, but to arrange a general 
    intermarriage between the clans of Jacob and the Sechemites (as in the Argive 
    myth, the collective marriage of the Fifty sons of Aigyptos with the Fifty 
    daughters of Danaos...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We can see </font><font size="+1">how the Hebrew <i>Dinah</i> 
  represents all Fifty daughters of Danaos. The letter D, or the Dalet in the 
  name of Dan, <img src="../../UsedImages/dandalet.gif" width="9" height="16">, 
  is numerically equivalent in the <a href="../../UsedImages/pg263.gif">ancient 
  Hebrew script</a> to the number Four; and the number Four can also be expressed 
  as Four Dalets <img src="../../UsedImages/SquareDalets.gif" width="14" height="14">, 
  which is the symbol of the great Universal Mandala of the Mystery of Christ 
  on the Tree of Life, which is also an expression of those mysteries that were 
  hidden by the Hebrew scribes in the center of Europe. And then the letter N, 
  or Nun, in the name DaN, is equal to Fifty, and 50 is the number assigned in 
  the Scriptures to the precepts of the Great Jubilee which must be observed by 
  all the children of Israel in the fulness of time. It must be observed in the 
  Seventh Month, which occurs during the Harvest Season in the Great Solar Year.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The closest relationship between 
    agriculture and justice--as in the figure of Danel--manifests itself in the 
    Feast of Thesmorphoria, allegedly introduced by the Danaides and dedicated 
    to the agricultural goddess Demeter </font>(see Mark 4:26-29; John 12:23-25)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    the 'law carrier' or 'law-giver.' What is important is not the historical 
    reliability of that version, but the very fact of the Danaides being associated 
    with the main agrarian and chthonic feast of pre-Dorian women. Pgt, 'who knows 
    the course of the stars,' is precisely the type of wise woman, expert in secret 
    religious lore.&quot; </font>(Please see Chapter V)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.

  <p>The Imperial letter-patent to Bach was dated 20 December 1857. The first 
    step was to set up a commission which would have authority for everything 
    connected with the expansion and rebuilding of the city, finance included. 
    On 31 January 1858, projects were invited, a competition was thrown open to 
    architects...The ramparts facing the Danube Canal (however) had already been 
    razed, and a boulevard along the quay laid out...</p>
  <p>The former Lutheran church in the castle of Hernals became the centre of 
    religious stage-management at its theatrical best. After it had been reconsecrated 
    in the presence of the court and emperor, THE CHAPTER OF ST. STEPHEN DECIDED 
    TO BUILD NEXT TO IT A HOLY SEPULCHRE ON THE MODEL OF JERUSALEM.</p>
  <p>A VIA CRUCIS (The Way of the Cross) WITH SEVEN STATIONS WAS MAPPED OUT, STARTING 
    FROM THE DOOR OF ST. STEPHEN'S, PASSING THROUGH THE CITY GATE NEAR THE <i>SCHOTTEN</i> 
    ABBEY, LEADING TO MOUNT CALVARY AND THE HOLY SEPULCHRE IN HERNALS. The city 
    corporation payed for the first station, the others were built out of pious 
    contributions. Every Friday before Palm Sunday, a penitentiary procession 
    went from the cathedral to its goal in St. Bartholomew's Church, as it came 
    to be called. Lay organizations called confraternities, a mediaeval tradition 
    now refurbished by the Jesuits and giving the Viennese an outlet for their 
    hierarchical ambitions, soon turned these processions into macabre carnivals...</p>
  <p>The plain economic fact is that the vineyards in the lee of the Wienerwald 
    were of the greatest importance to Vienna's everyday life, from the earliest 
    beginnings. MODERN SCHOLARSHIP HAS ESTABLISHED THAT VINES WERE GROWN THERE 
    EVEN BEFORE THE LEGIONARIES INTRODUCED THEIR MORE REFINED STOCK--up to the 
    transformation of Older Vienna into Old Vienna...In 1524, a charter of Archduke 
    Ferdinand called wine &quot;the principal nourishment of the city of Vienna.&quot;...Customs 
    of a strictly practical origin will be handed on as unquestioned rites and 
    hallowed traditions, and largely survive the conditions whence they have sprung. 
    Something of this kind happened with the vinous part of Viennese civilization. 
    As long as the vineyards were cultivated around and between the <i>Vorstadte--</i>the 
    last suburban vineyard was registered till the end of the eighteenth century--the 
    interest of the Viennese in the quality of the <i>New Wine, </i>the <i>Heurige</i>, 
    was matter-of-fact. It was no more than natural that the pleasantest, most 
    popular wine-gardens were set up in the wine-growing villages outside the 
    Line Wall, near the edge of the woods in the garden or yard of the vintner 
    himself.&quot;</p>

<p><font size="+1"> Not only do we learn what things were left hidden from the 
  world by the adepts of the early Christian mysteries, but the whole of it also 
  teaches us that as the ancient mysteries fell from the purely Hebrew into what 
  will later be called the pagan state of mind, they seemed to take on a life 
  of their own apart from their original source. The Mystery of Christ--and long 
  before the time of Christ itself--was transformed into the mysteries of Dionysus, 
  the god of the Vine. These are, of course, the very same that are expressed 
  in the rituals and the liturgy of the Catholic Mass. And the Cup of Dionysus, 
  or Bacchus, is the very same that is lifted to God at every Passover celebration. 
  The wine in such rituals, however, is embued with Hebrew flavor and aroma, and 
  consumed (we must assume) in a completely Hebrew frame of mind rather than pagan:</font></p>

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
    supreme deity of the ancient Greeks, during their historical period at least, 
    was Zeus. His name, referable to a root that means 'to shine,' may be rendered 
    'the Bright One.' </font>(As Varuna in the Hindu myths...see Exodus 24:10)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    And since a whole series of related words in the various languages of the 
    Indo-European are used to denote 'day' or 'sky,' it can be safely inferred 
    that Zeus was called 'the Bright One' as being the god of the bright and day-light 
    sky. Indeed, a presumption is raised that Zeus was first conceived, not in 
    anthropomorphic fashion as the bright-sky god, but simply as the bright sky 
    itself. </font>(see 1 Thessalonians 5)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Closely akin to the substantive 
    Zeus is the adjective 'dios,' which denotes properly 'of' or 'belonging to 
    Zeus.' This meaning it actually bears in Attic drama. But how is it that in 
    the much earlier Homeric poems it has the force of 'bright,' or 'glorious' 
    without any such restrictions to the property of a personal Zeus? Probably 
    because the word was formed before Zeus became a personality, when as yet 
    he was...'the Radiant Sky.' Dios in fact meant at first 'of' or 'belonging' 
    to the Bright sky, and a vestige of its primary meaning is to be found in 
    the frequent Homeric phrases, 'the bright upper air' and 'the bright dawn.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The transition from brightness 
    in this sense to glory and splendor in general is not hard to follow. Further, 
    when Zeus came to be regarded as an individual sky god, the way was open for 
    'dios, of the bright sky' to take on the more personal meaning, 'of the god 
    Zeus.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another adjective 'endios' occurs 
    in epic verses with the meaning 'in broad daylight' or at 'Mid-Day.' For example, 
    Nestor in the Iliad describes an expedition in which he had once taken part: 
    'At Mid-Day (endios) came to the sacred stream Alpheios.' Eidothea too in 
    the Odyssey tells Menelaos the habits of her father Proteus: 'What time the 
    Sun bestrides Mid-heaven, there comes shoreward the unerring Ancient of the 
    Sea.' And fifty lines later: 'So, while Mid-Day (endios) endured and earth 
    grew hot. More brilliant than crystal shone the sky.'&quot; </font>From a 
    chapter entitled Zeus and the Sky<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Elsewhere the same author 
    expresses the Orphic belief that the infant Dionysus 'was a second Zeus...and 
    sent the Rain Storm.' These and other indications of an essential connection 
    between Dionysus and the rain warrant us in attaching weight to Pherekydes' 
    statements. It would seem in Thraco-Phrygian myths, not only did Zeus descend 
    upon Semele in rain when he (they) begat Dionysus, but Dionysus himself 'a 
    second Zeus' came upon the 'nysai' or Trees, in the form of rain. </font>(see 
    Hosea 6:1-3 and Deuteronomy 32:1,2)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...And 
    after all 'nysai' (trees) are compatible with 'nysai' (nymphs), for nymphs 
    may be tree-nymphs, and it is on record that Dionysus was nursed upon the 
    Dryads, (nature spirits, or builders of perfect forms on the higher plane)...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exception might be taken to Kretschmer's 
    view that the sky-god was called Zeus by the Thracians as well as the Hellenes. 
    That view is based on the fact that, just as Hellenic names derived from Zeus...so 
    Thracian names begin sometimes with Deo-, Dio, Diu, sometimes with Deos-, 
    Dios-, the twofold method of formation, producing on the one hand a compound, 
    e.g. Dio-nysos, on the other a synthesis, e.g. Dios-nysos. But these data, 
    it seems to me, are susceptible of another interpretation, viz. that corresponds 
    with the Hellenic sky-god Zeus. There was a Thracian sky-god Dios, whose name 
    coupled with an appelative appeared now as Dios Papas or the like, 'Dios the 
    Father,' now as 'Dios-Nysos,' 'Dios the Son.' The Greeks familiar with Dios 
    as the generative case of Zeus, would inevitably take this Dios-Nysos (or 
    Dio-nysus) to mean Son of Zeus.&quot; </font>From a chapter entitled Dios

    is a series of gates...It will be convenient and more correct to call it the 
    'Book of Gates...As the Book Am-Tuat was composed with the view of asserting

    and had its characteristics molded, by the far less numerous but more powerful 
    Milesian aristocracy and soldiery.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All three of these races, however, 
    were different tribes of the great Celtic family, who, long ages before, had 
    separated from the main stream, and in course of later centuries blended again 
    into one tribe of Gaels--three derivatives of one stream, which after winding 
    their several ways across Europe from the East...finally blended in amity, 
    and flowed onward in one great Gaelic stream.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of these three certain colonisations 
    of Ireland, the Firbolg was the first. Legend says they came from Greece, 
    where they had long been enslaved, and whence they escaped in the captured 
    ships of their masters...But the possession of the country was wrested from 
    the Firbolgs, and they were forced into partial serfdom by the Tuatha De Danann 
    (people of the goddess Dana) who arrived later...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Totally unlike the uncultured Firbolgs, 
    the Tuatha De Danann were a capable and cultured, highly civilized people, 
    so skilled in the crafts, if not the arts, that the Firbolgs named them necromancers 
    </font> (practitioners of the art of revealing future events by calling up 
    the spirits of the dead...compare 1 Samuel 28:7-15 and of the methods employed 
    by the entire school of Christian prophets after the time of Christ...&quot;For 
    Christ was dead, and is now alive.&quot;)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">; 
    and in course of time both the Firbolgs and the...Milesians created a mythology 
    around them. </font>(continued)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The question will arise, especially among present-day Jews: 
  if the Tutha De Danann are among the children of Israel, why do we not find 
  them in history speaking a Hebrew dialect? And the simple answer is, we do. 
  The ancient Gaelic language is the proto-Hebrew dialect. The language that we 
  associate with Hebrew in our time, which was not a spoken language at all in 
  time of Moses (nor was it ever intended to be), was still being created over 
  on the mainland of Europe. It was being devised by that school of the &quot;Druid&quot; 
  religion that was versed in the emerging Hebrew literary tradition--in the allegories 
  and stories--and in the Kabbalistic means by which the Indo-European-Gaelic 
  language of that ancient time was being cryptically transmitted into a sacerdotal 
  Hebrew script. The methods used presently fall under the headings of Gamatria, 
  Notariqon, Temura, and Atbash. This Hebrew code was being devised for the use 
  of the priests and Levites, so that they could keep the Hebrew mysteries (thus 
  access to the oracles of truth) from the sons of Darkness (and it seems they 
  succeeded)... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As these adepts in the Hebrew mysteries walked abroad, transmitting 
  Hebrew precepts and teachings to the peoples around them, they had the ability, 
  or the choice, to do so directly from their own hidden code, thus speaking directly 
  to those who were candidates for initiation into the Inner mysteries, or outwardly 
  in allegories and metaphors to the people at large. They read from their Hebrew 
  code (which had no specific sound in itself other than the Gaelic from it was 
  devised) but spoke to the people in the various languages and dialects of the 
  peoples themselves. They might explain the mysteries of Christ for instance, 
  which were written there in the types and images of their Torah code, in terms 
  of what would later become the Druid cult of Hesus, or the Greek cults of Apollo 
  and Dionysus, or the Thracian Adonis. All of which served in later times to 
  create a mythological system among the other peoples and nations that seemed 
  to be <i>like</i> the Hebrew myths, but different. The reality is that they 
  are all directly related, and all the adepts in the World-mystery, throughout 
  every succeeding generation, have found the freedom to interpret them as such 
  and to interrelate them.</font></p>

    like those of the East. They indulged in the pleasures of the chase, and of 
    fighting, but were more given to the pursuit of Erin's fairest daughters.

    led into trouble thereby.</font></p>

    a goddess called by the ancients Grane.&quot; The Phrygians had a god &quot;Grynaeus.&quot; 
    &quot;Grane&quot; and Baal both refer to the sun. J.T. O'Flarrety regarded 
    the Irish word &quot;Grian&quot; as pure Phoenician. The &quot;Four Masters&quot; 
    inform their readers that &quot;the monarch Loagaire had sworn ratha-Greine 
    agus Gavithe;&quot; this is, by the Sun and the Wind. Breaking his oath, he

    1822, spoke of the Irish word &quot;Sibbol&quot; as &quot;a name by which 
    the Irish, as well as almost all other nations, designated and worshipped

    dew, and then mounting a hill to see the sunrise. According to Schedius, the 
    word may be rendered 2 + 8 + 30 + 5 + 50 + 70 + 200 or 365, the period in 
    days of the sun's annual round. The solar Hercules was represented In Irish
