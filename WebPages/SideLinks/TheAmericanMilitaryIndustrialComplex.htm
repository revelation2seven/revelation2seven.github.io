  <p><font size="+2">THE WARRIOR CULTURE</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">An Essay by Barbara Ehrenreich</font></p>
  <p><font size="+2">(And the Church That Supports It...Revelation, chapter 17)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In what we like to 
    think of as &quot;primitive&quot; warrior cultures, the passage to manhood 
    requires the blooding of a spear, the taking of a scalp or head...Leadership 
    too in a warrior culture is typically contingent on military prowess and wrapped 
    in the mystique of death. In the Solomon Islands a chief's importance could 
    be reckoned by the number of skulls posted around his door </font>(The Skull 
    and Crossbones)?<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> and it was the 
    duty of Aztec kings to nourish the gods with the hearts of human captives.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All warrior peoples 
    have fought for the same high-sounding reasons: honor, glory or revenge. The 
    nature of their real and perhaps not conscious motivation is a subject of 
    much debate. Some anthropologists postulate a murderous instinct</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    almost unique among living species, in human males. </font>(See John 8:43,44)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Others discern a materialistic motive behind every fray: a need for slaves, 
    grazing land or even human flesh to eat. Still others point to the similarities 
    between war and other male pastimes--the hunt and outdoor sports--and suggest 
    that it is boredom, ultimately, that stirs men to fight.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But in a warrior culture 
    it hardly matters which motive is most basic. Aggressive behavior is rewarded 
    whether or not it is innate to the human psyche. Shortages of resources are 
    habitually taken as occasions for armed offensives...And war, to a warrior 
    people, is of course the highest adventure, the surest antidote to malaise, 
    the endlessly repeated theme of legend, song, religious myth and personal 
    quest for meaning. It is how men die and what they find to live for.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;YOU MUST UNDERSTAND 
    THAT AMERICANS ARE A WARRIOR NATION,&quot; Senator Patrick Moynihan told a 
    group of Arab leaders...He said this proudly, and he may, without thinking 
    through the ugly implications, have told the truth. In any ways, in outlook 
    and behavior the U.S. has begun to act like a primitive warrior culture.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We seem to believe 
    that leadership is expressed in no small part by a willingness to cause the 
    death of others. After the U.S. invasion of Panama, President Bush exulted 
    that no one could call him &quot;timid;&quot; he was at last a &quot;macho 
    man,&quot; </font>(Joel 3:9,10)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The press, in even more primal language, hailed him for succeeding in an &quot;initiation 
    rite&quot; by demonstrating his &quot;willingness to shed blood.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For lesser offices 
    too we apply the standards of a warrior culture. Female candidates are routinely 
    advised to overcome the handicap of their gender by &quot;talking tough.&quot; 
    Thus, for example, Dianne Fienstein has embraced capital punishment, while 
    Colorado senatorial candidate Josie Heath has found it necessary to announce 
    that although she is the mother of an 18-year-old son, she is prepared to 
    vote for war. Male candidates in some of the fall contests are finding their 
    military records under scrutiny. No one expects them, as elected officials 
    in a civilian government, to pick up a spear or a sling and fight. But they 
    must state, at least, their willingness to have another human killed.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most tellingly, we 
    are unnerved by peace and seem to find it boring. When the cold war ended, 
    we found no reason to celebrate. Instead we heated up &quot;the war on drugs.&quot; 
    What should have been a public-health ca campaign, focused on the persistent 
    shame of poverty, became a new occasion for martial rhetoric and muscle flexing. 
    Months later, when the Berlin Wall fell and communism collapsed throughout 
    Europe, we Americans did not dance in the streets. What we did, according 
    to the networks, was change the channel to avoid the news. Nonviolent resolutions 
    do not uplift us, and the loss of mortal enemies only seems to leave us empty 
    and bereft.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our collective fantasies 
    center on mayhem, cruelty and violent death. Loving images of the human body--especially 
    of bodies seeking pleasure or expressing love--inspire us with the urge to 
    censor. Our preference is for warrior themes: the lone fighting man, bandoliers 
    across the naked chest, mowing down lesser men in gusts of automatic-weapon 
    fire. Only a real war seems to revive our interest in real events. With the 
    Iraqi crisis, the networks report, ratings for news shows rose again--even 
    higher than they were for Panama.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As in any primitive 
    warrior culture, our warrior elite takes pride of place. Social crises multiply 
    numbingly--homelessness, illiteracy, epidemic disease--and our leaders tell 
    us solemnly that nothing can be done. There is no money. We are poor, not 
    rich, a debtor nation. </font>(Ecclesiastes 5:1-14)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Meanwhile, nearly a third of the federal budget flows, even in moments of 
    peace, to the warriors and their weaponmakers. When those priorities are questioned, 
    some new &quot;crisis&quot; dutifully arises to serve as another occasion 
    for armed and often unilateral intervention.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now with Operation 
    Desert Shield </font>(Do we mean Operation Iraqi Freedom)?<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    our leaders are reduced to begging foreign powers for the means to support 
    our warrior class. It does not seem to occur to us that THE OTHER GREAT NORTHERN 
    POWERS--Japan, Germany, the Soviet Union (France, Germany, Russia)--might 
    not have found the stakes so high or the crisis quite so threatening. It has 
    not penetrated our imagination that in a world where the powerful, industrialized 
    nation-states are at last at peace, there might be other ways to face down 
    a pint--size Third World warrior state than with massive force of arms. Nor 
    have we begun to see what an anachronism we are in danger of becoming: a warrior 
    nation in a world that pines for peace, a high-tech state with the values 
    of a warrior band. </font>(Please see the sub-chapter entitled Cain and Nimrod)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A leftists might blame 
    &quot;imperialism,&quot; a right-winger would call our problem &quot;internationalism.&quot; 
    But an anthropologist, taking the long view, might say this is just what warriors 
    do. INTOXICATED </font>(1 Thessalonians 5)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    by their own drumbeats and war songs, fascinated by the glint of steel and 
    the prospect of blood, they will go forth time and again to war. </font>Time<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to talk this evening about 
  war--not the immediate threat of war against Iraq, but about how this conflict 
  is an instance of a larger tendency toward warmaking endemic to our society. 
  In other words, the phrase from the folksong, &quot;I aint gonna study war no 
  more,&quot; should be rethought, I think we do have to study war. Not to make 
  war, but to understand more deeply how it is put together and about the awful 
  choices that are now being thrust upon us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These remarks have been stimulated 
  by recent events, <i> which have ancient roots, </i>but which have taken on 
  a new shape since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rise of the second Bush 
  administration, and the inception of the so-called &quot;War on Terror.&quot; 
  The shape is that <i>of permanent warfare</i>--warmaking that has no particular 
  strategic goal <i>except total US dominance over global society. </i>Hence, 
  a war without end and whose internal logic is to perpetuate itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are, in other words, well into 
  World War III, which will go on whether or not any other such state as Iraq 
  is involved. It is quite probable that this administration will go to war in 
  Iraq, inasmuch as certain very powerful people crave it. But it is not necessarily 
  the case, given the fact that the war against Iraq is such a lunatic proposal 
  that many other people in high places are against it--and too many people are 
  marching against it. And while war against Iraq is a very serious matter that 
  needs to be checked by massive popular resistance, equally serious are the structures 
  now in place in the United States dictating that whether or not war in Iraq 
  takes place, there will be another war to replace it, and others after that, 
  <i>unless some very basic changes take place</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AMERICA HAS BECOME A WAR-MAKING MACHINE</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The United States has always been 
  a bellicose and expansive country, built on violent conquest and expropriation 
  of native peoples. Since the forming of the American republic, military interventions 
  have occurred at a rate of about once a year. Consider the case of Nicaragua, 
  a country utterly incapable of being any kind of threat to its giant northern 
  neighbor. Yet prior to the Sandanista revolution in 1979 (which was eventually 
  crushed by proxy forces a decade later), our country had invaded Nicaragua no 
  fewer than 14 times in the pursuit of its imperial interests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A considerable number of contemporary 
  states, such as Britain, South Africa, Russia and Israel, have been formed in 
  just such a way. But one of the special conditions of the formation of America, 
  despite its aggresivity, was an inhibition against a military machine as such. 
  If you remember, no less a figure than George Washington warned us against having 
  a standing army, and indeed the great bulk of US inventions prior to World War 
  II were done without very much in the way of fixed military institutions. However, 
  after WWII a basic change set in. War-weary America longed for demobilization, 
  yet after a brief beginning in this direction, the process was halted and the 
  permanent warfare state started to take shape. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In part, this was because policy 
  planners knew quite well that massive wartime mobilization had been the one 
  measure that finally lifted America out of the Great Depression. One of the 
  lessons of that time was that propounded by the British economist John Maynard 
  Keynes, to the effect that <i>capitalist societies</i> could ameliorate chronic 
  (economic) crises by infusions of government spending. The Great War had certified 
  this wisdom, and permanent military expenditure readily became the <i>received 
  wisdom</i>. This was greatly reinforced by the drastic realignment of capitalist 
  power as a result of the war. America was essentially the only capitalist power 
  in 1945 that did not lay in ruins and/or have its empire shattered. The world 
  has been realigned <i>and the United States had assumed a global imperial role</i>. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Policy planners like George Kennen 
  lucidly realized that this meant safeguarding extreme inequalities in wealth, 
  which implied a permanent garrison to preserve the order of things. The notion 
  was especially compelling given that one other state, the Soviet Union, had 
  emerged a great power from the war and was the bellwether of those forces that 
  sought to break down the prevailing distribution of wealth. The final <i>foundation 
  stone</i> for the new military order was was the emergence of frightful weapons 
  of mass destruction, dominance over which became an essential element for world 
  hegemony.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE IRON TRIANGLE</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These factors crystallized into the 
  Cold War, the nuclear arms race, and, domestically, into those structures that 
  gave institutional stability and permanence to the system: the military-industrial 
  complex (MIC). Previously the US had used militarism to secure economic advantage. 
  Now two developments greatly transformed our militarism: the exigencies of global 
  hegemony and the fact that militarism became the direct source of economic advantage, 
  through the triangular relations of the MIC--with the great armament industries 
  comprising one leg, the military establishment another, and the state the third--profits, 
  power, and personnel could flow through the system and from the system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly this arrangement had the 
  potential to greatly undermine American democracy. It was a &quot;national security 
  state&quot; within the state but also extended beyond into the economy and society 
  at large, virtually insulated from popular input, and had the power to direct 
  events and generate threats. Another conservative war hero-become-president, 
  Dwight Eisenhower, warned the nation in a speech in 1961 against the emerging 
  permanent war machine, but this time, the admonitions were not heeded.</font></p>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The machine made a kind of war 
    against the Soviet system for 35 years. Although actual guns were not fired 
    between the two adversaries, as many as 10 million people died in its varied 
    peripheral conflicts, from Korea to Vietnam, Angola, El Salvador, Nicaragua, 
    and Guatemala. The Cold War divided the world into bipolar imperial camps, 
    directed by gigantic superpowers that lived off each other's hostility. It 
    was a terrible war whose immense suffering took place largely outside the 
    view of the American people, but it also brought about an uneasy kind of stability 
    in the world order, in part through the standoff in nuclear weapons.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the Ford and Carter administrations, 
    another great crisis seized the world capitalist economy Having matured past 
    the rebuilding that followed the world war, a period of stagnation set in, 
    which still has the global economy in its grip despite episodic flashes of 
    vigor. Predictably, a spate of militarism was central to the response. A &quot;Second 
    Cold War&quot; took place under Reagan, featuring an accelerated nuclear arms 
    race, which was deliberately waged so as to encourage Soviet countermeasures 
    in the hope that this would cause breakdown in the much weaker, bloated, and 
    corrupt Russian system. The plan worked splendidly: by 1989-91, the mighty 
    Soviet empire collapsed, and the bipolar world order became unipolar , setting 
    a stage for the current phase.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fall of the Soviet Union was 
    widely expected to bring a &quot;peace dividend.&quot; This would have been 
    the case according to the official US line, parroted throughout the media 
    and academe, that our military apparatus was purely defensive (after all, 
    we have no Department of War, only one of &quot;Defense&quot;) and reactive 
    to Soviet expansionism and military/ nuclear threat. As this was no longer 
    a factor, so the reasoning went indeed, as the us now stood bestride the world 
    militarily as had no power since the Roman Empire---conventional logic predicted 
    a general diminution in American militarism after 1991, with corresponding 
    benefits to society.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last decade has at least settled 
    this question, for the effect on us aggression, interventionism, and the militarization 
    of society has been precisely the opposite. In other words, instead of breaking, 
    the machine accelerated.' Removal of Soviet power did not diminish America's 
    imperial appetite: it removed inhibitions on its internally driven expansiveness. 
    As a result, enhanced war-making has replaced the peace dividend.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The object of this machine has 
    passed from dealing with Soviet Communism to a more complex and dispersed 
    set of oil wars (Iraq I and now II), police actions against international 
    miscreants (Kosovo), and now the ubiquitous War Against Terror, aimed variously 
    at Islamic fundamentalists, Islam as a whole, or anybody irritated enough 
    with the ruling order to take up some kind of arms against it. The comparison 
    with the Roman Empire is here very exact. As the eminent economist and sociologist 
    Joseph Schumpeter described Rome in 1919: &quot;There was no comer of the 
    known world where some interest was not alleged to be in danger or under actual 
    attack. If the interests were not Roman, they were those of Rome's allies. 
    And if Rome had no allies that existed, allies would be invented The fight 
    was always invested with the order of legality, Rome was always being attacked 
    by evil-minded neighbors</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The logic of constant threat meshes 
    with that of ruthless expansion,which we see everywhere in this epoch of unipolar 
    world dominion. Currently, the military budget of the US is 334 billion dollars. 
    The budget for the next fiscal year is 379 billion dollars--an increase of 
    more than 10 percent. By 2007, the projected military budget of the US is 
    to be an astounding 451 billion dollars: almost half a trillion dollar, without 
    the presence of anything resembling a conventional war. The present military 
    budget is greater than the sum of all other military budgets. In fact, it 
    is greater than the entire federal budget of Russia, once America's immortal 
    adversary and comprises more than half-52 percent-of all discretionary spending 
    by the us government. (By comparison, education accounts for 8 percent of 
    the federal budget)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A considerable portion of this 
    is given over to &quot;military Keynesianism ,&quot; according to the well-established 
    paths of the MIC. Thus, although in the first years after the fall of the 
    USSR certain firms like General Dynamics, which had played a large role in 
    the nuclear arms race, suffered setbacks, that problem has been largely reversed 
    for the entire class of firms fattening at the trough of militarism. It is 
    fair to say, though, that the largesse is distributed over a wider scale, 
    in accordance with the changing pattern of armaments.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">US ARMIES TAKING ROOT EVERYWHERE</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> From having scarcely any standing 
    army in 1940, American armies now stand everywhere. One feature of US military 
    policy since WWII is to make war and then stay where war was made, rooting 
    itself in foreign territory. Currently, the US has military bases in 113 countries, 
    with 11 new ones formed since the beginning of the War Against Terror. The 
    US now has bases in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kurdistan, encircling China 
    and creating new sources of military tension. On these bases, the US military 
    has erected some 800,000 buildings. Imagine that: 800,000 buildings in foreign 
    countries that are now occupied by us military establishments.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And America still maintains large 
    forces in Germany, Japan, and Korea, with tens of thousands of troops permanently 
    on duty (and making mischief, as two us servicemen recently ran over and killed 
    two Korean girls, provoking massive demonstrations). After the first Gulf 
    War the us military became installed in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, in which 
    latter place it currently occupies one quarter of the country-750 square miles 
    devoted to military activity This huge investment is no doubt determined by 
    proximity to Iraq. Again, after going to war in Kosovo, the us left behind 
    an enormous base in a place called Bondsteel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These self-expanding sites of militarism 
    are permanent goads to terrorist organizations. Recall that one of Osama bin 
    Laden's professed motivations for al Qaeda's attacks on American facilities 
    was the presence of us bases in his home country of Saudi Arabia. The bases 
    are also permanent hazards to the environment--indeed, the US, with some 800,000 
    buildings on these military sites, is the world's largest polluter and the 
    largest consumer of fossil fuels.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With territorial expansion of the 
    US military apparatus, there is a corresponding expansion of mission. For 
    instance, in Colombia, where billions of US dollars are spent in the &quot;War 
    on Drugs,&quot; US troops are now being asked to take care of pipelines through 
    which vital oil reserves are passing. In addition, the War on Drugs is now 
    subsumed into the War Against Terror. The signifier of Terror has virtually 
    unlimited elasticity, for once an apparatus reaches the size of the US military 
    machine, threats can be seen anywhere. With the inauguration of the new hard-line 
    president of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, the US authorized the use of 1.7 billion 
    dollars in military aid hitherto limited to anti-drug operations for direct 
    attacks on deeply entrenched FARC guerrillas. This redirection of aid came 
    after Colombian officials and their American supporters in the Congress and 
    Bush administration argued that the change was needed as part of the global 
    campaign against terrorism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Within this overall picture, American 
    armed forces are undergoing a qualitative shift of enormous proportion. In 
    words read by President Bush: &quot;Our forces in the next century must be 
    agile, lethal, readily deployable, and must require a minimum of logistical 
    support. <i>We must be able to project our power</i> over long distances in 
    days or weeks rather than months. On land our heavy forces must be lighter, 
    our light forces must be more lethal. All must be easier to deploy&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CROSSING WEAPONS BOUNDRIES--BOTH 
    NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result, many boundaries and 
    limits of the bipolar era have been breached. For example, the distinction 
    between nuclear and conventional weapons had always constituted a radical 
    barrier. The standoff between the US and the USSR was epitomized by mind-numbing 
    hydrogen bomb-missiles facing each other in a scenario called &quot;Mutual 
    Assured Destruction.&quot; In short, a strategic condition of deterrence prevailed, 
    which made nuclear weapons seem unthinkable. With the demise of the USSR, 
    deterrence no longer inhibits US nuclear weaponry, and the weapons themselves 
    have proliferated downward, becoming miniaturized and <br>
    increasingly tactical rather than strategic. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, the genie of the weapons 
    industries has developed ever more destructive &quot;conventional&quot; weapons. 
    These include non-explosive devices of awesome power, such as laser beams, 
    microwaves, <i>and large-scale climate manipulation</i>, along with a new 
    generation of super-powerful explosive devices. Thus the strongest non-nuclear 
    weapons are now considerably more lethal than the least powerful nuclear weapons, 
    making the latter thinkable and eliminating a major barrier against their 
    employment. These so-called conventional bombs have already been used, for 
    example, in Afghanistan, where the US employed a gigantic explosive weapon, 
    called a &quot;Bunker Buster&quot; to root out al-Qaeda combatants in underground 
    bunkers. They are based upon the &quot;daisy cutter,&quot; a giant bomb about 
    the size of a Volkswagen Beetle and capable of destroying everything within 
    a square kilometer. Significantly, the model used in Afghanistan, the B61-11, 
    already employs nuclear technology, the infamous depleted uranium warhead, 
    capable by virtue of its extreme density, of great penetrating power.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depleted uranium (DU) is a by-product 
    of the nuclear power industry (chiefly being U-238 created in the extraction 
    of U-235 from naturally occurring uranium ore). Over 500,000 tons of deadly 
    DU have accumulated and 4,000 to 5,000 more tons are being produced every 
    year. Like all products of the nuclear power industry, DU poses immense challenges 
    of disposal. It has this peculiar property of being almost twice as dense 
    as lead and it is radioactive with a half-life of 4.5 billion years. Wherever 
    depleted uranium is used ,it has another peculiar property of exploding, vaporizing 
    at 56 degrees centigrade, which is just like a little more than half the way 
    to boiling water So it is very volatile, it explodes, it forms dust and powders 
    that are inhaled, disburses widely and produces lethal cancers, birth defects, 
    and so forth for 4.5 billion years.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In case of depleted uranium, the 
    challenge of disposal was met by incorporating the refuse from the &quot;peaceful&quot; 
    branch of nuclear technology into the war making branch. Already used in anti-tank 
    projectiles in the first Iraq war (approximately 300 tons worth) and again 
    in Yugoslavia (approximately 10-15 tons were used in each of the various Yugoslav 
    wars), it is presumed, although the defense department coyly denies it, that 
    this material was also used in the Afghanistan war. Depleted uranium has spread 
    a plague of radioactivity and further rationalized the use of nuclear weapons 
    as such. Consequently, the B61-11 is about to be replaced with the BLU113, 
    where the bunker buster will now be a small nuclear weapon, almost certainly 
    spear-tipped with DU.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">POLLUTANTS TO EARTH AND SPACE</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the boundaries crossed between 
    nuclear and non-nuclear weapons, and between the peaceful and militaristic 
    uses of atomic technology, we need to add those between earth and its lower 
    atmosphere on the one hand, and space on the other.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In November 2002, Bush proposed 
    that NATO allies build missile defense systems, with components purchased, 
    needless to add, from Boeing, Raytheon, etc, even as Congress was approving 
    a fiscal 2003 defense budget containing $7.8 billion authorization for missile 
    defense research and procurement as part of the $238 billion set aside for 
    Star Wars over the next 20 years. The administrations , poised to realize 
    the crackpot and deadly schemes of the Reagan administration to militarize 
    space and to draw the rest of the world into the scheme, as client and victim. 
    A new missile defense system bureaucracy has risen. It is currently developing 
    such wild items as something called &quot;brilliant pebbles&quot; which involves 
    the release of endless numbers of mini satellites into outer space.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of this was to protect the 
    world against the threat of rogue states such as North Korea. As the <i>Seattle 
    Times</i> reported, the US expects the final declaration to, &quot;express 
    the need to examine options to protect allied forces, territories, and population 
    centers against the full range of missile threats.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
    an official put it, &quot;This will establish the framework within which NATO 
    allies could work cooperatively toward fielding the required capabilities. 
    With the US withdrawal this year from the anti-ballistic treaty with Russia, 
    it is no longer a question of whether missile defense will be deployed. The 
    relevant questions are now what, how, and when. The train is about to pull 
    out of the station; we invite our friends, allies, and the Russian Federation 
    to climb on board.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The destination of this train is 
    defensive only in the Orwellian sense, as the missiles will be used to defend 
    US troops in the field. In other words, they will be used to defend armies 
    engaged in offensive activities. What is being &quot;defended&quot; by the 
    Strategic Defense initiative (SDI) therefore, is the initiative to make war 
    everywhere.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Space has now become the ultimate 
    battlefield. And not just with use of these missiles. The High Frequency Active 
    Aural Research Program (HARP) is also part of SDI. This amounts to weather 
    warfare: deliberately manipulating climate to harm and destroy adversaries. 
    A very dubious enterprise, to say the least, in an age when global warming 
    and climate instability are already looming as two of the greatest problems 
    facing civilization. The chief feature is a network of powerful antennas capable 
    of creating controlled local modifications of the ionosphere and hence producing 
    weather disturbances and so forth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of these technical interventions 
    are accompanied by many kinds of institutional and political changes. The 
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, for instance, is now 
    a partner in the development of this strategic defense initiative. The very 
    way in which the United Nations was drawn into the resolution in the war against 
    Iraq is a breach and a violation of the original UN Charter, which is to never 
    make war; never to threaten to make war on any member state. The UN was a 
    peacemaking institution, but now the superpower has forced it into its orbit.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The scrapping of the ABM and other 
    elements of the treaty structure (non-proliferation, test-ban) that had organized 
    the world of the Cold War is one part of a process of shedding whatever might 
    inhibit the cancerous growth of militarism. It also creates an atmosphere 
    of general lawlessness in the world. This is felt at all levels-from the rise 
    of an ultra-militarist clique in the White House to the formal renunciation 
    of no-first-use nuclear strategy, the flouting of numerous UN regulations, 
    the doctrine of pre-emptive war, and, as the logical outcome of all these 
    developments, the condition of Permanent War and its accompaniment of general 
    lawlessness, media slavishness, and a wave of repression for whose parallel 
    we have to go back to the Alien and Sedition acts of the 1790s, or Truman's 
    loyalty oaths of 1947.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Militarism cannot be reduced to 
    politics, economics, technology, culture, or psychology. All these are parts 
    of the machine, make the machine go around, and are themselves produced by 
    the actions of the machine. There is no doubt, in this regard, that the machine 
    runs on natural resources (which have to be secured by economic, political, 
    and military action), and that it is deeply embedded in the ruling corporate 
    order. There is no contradiction here, but a set of meshing parts, driven 
    by an insensate demand for fossil fuel energy. As a man from Amarillo, Texas 
    put it when interviewed by NPR as to the correctness of Bush's plan to go 
    to war in Iraq: &quot;I agree with the president, because how else are we 
    going to get the oil to fly the F- 16s?&quot; We go to war, in other words, 
    to get the oil needed to go to war.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A WHO'S WHO LIST OF MIC BENEFICIARIES</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fad that our government is 
    front-loaded with oil magnates is another part of the machine. It is of interest, 
    therefore, that Unocal, for example, celebrated Condoleezza Rice's ascendancy 
    to the post of National Security Advisor by naming an oil tanker after her. 
    Or that Dick Cheney, originally a poor boy, became a rich man after the first 
    Gulf War, when he switched from being Secretary of Defense, in charge of destroying 
    the Kuwait oil fields, to CEO of a then-smallish company, Halliburton, in 
    charge of rebuilding the same oil fields. Or that G W Bush himself, aside 
    from his failed venture with Harken Oil, is scion of a family and a dynasty 
    that controls the Carlyle Group, founded in 1987 by a former Carter administration 
    official. Carlyle is now worth over <br>
    $13 billion and its high officials include President Bush I, his Secretary 
    of State (and fixer of the coup that put Bush II in power) James Baker; Reagan's 
    Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, former British Prime Minister John Major, 
    and former Phillipine President Fidel Ramos, among others.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Carlyle Group has its fingers 
    everywhere, including &quot;defense&quot;, where it controls firms making 
    vertical missile launch systems currently in use on US Navy ships in the Arabian 
    sea, as well as a range of other weapons delivery systems and combat vehicles. 
    And as a final touch which the world's people would be much better off for 
    knowing, there are very definite connections between Carlyle and the family 
    of Osama bin Laden- a Saudi power whose fortunes have been fused with those 
    of the United States since the end of World War II. Thus the military-industrial 
    complex lives, breathes, and takes on new dimensions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a deep structural reason 
    for the present explosion of US militarism, most clearly traceable in the 
    activities of Vice President Cheney, made clear in the energy report that 
    he introduced with the generous assistance of Enron executives in May 2001. 
    According to the report, American reliance on imported oil will rise by from 
    about 52 percent of total consumption in 2001 to an estimated 66 percent in 
    2020. The reason for this is that world production, in general, and domestic 
    production in particular are going to remain flat (and, although the report 
    does not discuss this, begin dropping within the next 20 years). Meanwhile 
    consumption--which is a direct function of the relentless drive of capitalism 
    to expand commodity production is to grow by some two-thirds.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because the usage of oil must rise 
    in the worldview of a Cheney, the US will actually have to import 60 percent 
    more oil in 2020 to keep itself going than it does today. This means that 
    imports will have to rise from their current rate of about 10.4 million barrels 
    per day to about 16.7 million barrels per day. In the words of the report; 
    &quot;The only way to do this is persuade foreign supplier, to increase their 
    production to sell more of their output to the US.&quot; The meaning of these 
    words depends of course on the interpretation of &quot;persuade&quot;, which 
    in the US lexicon is to be read, I should think, as requiring a sufficient 
    military machine to coerce foreign suppliers. At that point they might not 
    even have to sell their output to the US, as it would already be possessed 
    by the superpower. Here we locate the root material fact underlying recent 
    us expansionism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This may seem an extravagant conclusion. 
    However an explicit connection to militarism--and Iraq--had been supplied 
    the month before, in April , 2001, in another report prepared by James Baker 
    and submitted to the Bush cabinet. This document, called &quot;Strategic Energy 
    Policy Challenges for the 21st Century&quot; concludes with refreshing candor 
    that &quot;the US remains a prisoner of its energy dilemma, Iraq remains a 
    destabilizing influence to the flow of oil to international markets from the 
    middle East, Saddam Hussein has also demonstrated a willingness to threaten 
    to use the oil weapon and to use his own export program to manipulate oil 
    markets, therefore the US should conduct an immediate policy review toward 
    Iraq, including military, energy, economic, and political diplomatic assessments.&quot; 
    Note the absence of reference to &quot;weapons of mass destruction,&quot; 
    or aid to terrorism, convenient rationalizations that can be filled in later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly, however things turn out 
    with Iraq, the fundamental structural dilemma driving the military machine 
    pertains to the contradictions of an empire that drives toward the invasion 
    of all social space <i>and the total control over nature</i>. Since the former 
    goal meets up with unending resistance and the latter crashes against the 
    finitude of the material world, there is no recourse except the ever-widening 
    resort to force. But this, the military monster itself, ever seeking threats 
    to feed upon, becomes a fresh source of danger, whether of nuclear war; terror, 
    or ecological breakdown.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The situation is plainly unsustainable, 
    a series of disasters, waiting to happen. It can only be checked and brought 
    to rationality <i>by a global uprising of people</i> who demand an end to 
    the regime of endless war. This is the only possible path by which we can 
    pull ourselves away from the abyss into which the military machine is about 
    <br>
    to plunge, dragging us all down with it.</font></p>

  <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For some reason &#151; 
    perhaps it's just the passing of time &#151; it has now become somewhat fashionable 
    &#151; or at least permissable &#151; to criticize the utterly insane, totally 
    criminal and horrifically inhuman performance by what is known colloquially 
    in Washington these days as the Bush Administration. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Yet because of the eager cheering 
    of the television networks covering up bestial carnage by U.S. troops upon 
    hapless citizens of defenseless countries, and the continuing lawless behavior 
    of those in charge of our nation's laws, nothing significant has yet been 
    accomplished by those throwbacks like you and me still clinging to the faded, 
    prostituted dream of liberty and justice for all upon which our country was 
    ostensibly founded. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True, 
    there has been some tongue-wagging about how America dropped its radioactive 
    torture on Afghanistan and Iraq after telling whoppers of lies that never 
    would have gone unchallenged in an eighth-grade debate class, but nevertheless 
    managed to hold spellbound the entire American populace while these evil massacres 
    took place. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But the identification of the 
    nub of the problem that has turned America from a promising melting pot of 
    financial and social opportunity into a grim gulag of greed and graft is still 
    very far from happening. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
    it may never happen. It never has yet. All those famous crimes we all talk 
    about have never been solved. At least no actual perpetrator has ever been 
    charged, though a few convenient patsies have been executed. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    intense flag waving and hyped-up security measures &#151; accompanied by the 
    flaunted but bogus claims of less liberty means more safety &#151; continue 
    to inhibit public debate on these matters, as is evidenced by the focus on 
    irrelevant issues by the current pack of Democratic presidential panderers, 
    who like the rest of the country, are simply too insincere to admit that behind 
    the red, white and blue bunting lies a bloodthirsty beast which is now cannibalizing 
    even its own citizens in its desperate effort to sate the infinite appetites 
    of the trillionaires who run the war machine. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Sure, questions are being asked 
    about the lies used to justify the wars, but the men who do the lying continue 
    to victimize the folks who do the dying, both at home and abroad. No one of 
    any social consequence in the entire world has yet seriously questioned the 
    single, suspicious event that enabled &#151; by the patriotic mobilization 
    of public opinion &#151; America to come out of the closet as a worldwide 
    murder-for-hire operation... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
    foremost among the silently complicit are the brainwashed American people, 
    who accept their watered down news like the prisoners they are, eating pathetic 
    bioengineered gruel from cardboard boxes in their sad towns with abandoned 
    department stores, no decent jobs, and starving senior citizens. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How is it that wide-eyed young 
    journalists can graduate from America's finest colleges (not Harvard; that's 
    an Israeli school now) and know about U.S. troops laughing during target practice 
    on unarmed Iraqi civilians and simply turn their heads away and not write 
    those stories because they accept the perverted propaganda of national security 
    justifying the massacre of innocent civilians? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How 
    is it that churchgoing American parents can let their beloved children put 
    on their proud uniforms when they know &#151; or should know! &#151; that 
    those kids are going to be cursed with lifelong diseases caused by the vaccines 
    they are forced to take and the poisonous ammunition they are commanded to 
    handle? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How is that our most respected 
    statesmen and religious leaders can remain silent when they know that the 
    evidence of the biggest, most horrendous crime in American history was deliberately 
    destroyed without a thorough forensic examination which could have revealed 
    how that crime was committed, can remain silent when their government tells 
    millions of people that their air is safe to breathe when it wasn't, can remain 
    silent when the big pharmaceutical companies give court-ordered vaccinations 
    to children that turn many of them into vegetables, and the grieving parents 
    can't even sue the makers of the poison? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How is it that the American people 
    can have available to them infrared footage of the Waco massacre that shows 
    federal agents putting bullets into the heads of little children, that they 
    can have documented evidence of respected generals explaining how multiple 
    bombs were attached to the stanchions of that building in Oklahoma City, that 
    they can see convincing photographs that prove that none of the three planes 
    that took off full of happy people on that sunny morning of September 11, 
    2001 were the same planes that hit their bloody targets ... how is it the 
    American people can turn away from these things and not go ... ? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Those well-meaning people around 
    the world who carefully stipulate that it's not the behavior of the American 
    people they object to, but the behavior of the American government that upsets 
    them so ... those people are wrong. Something has curdled in the American 
    bloodstream. Honesty and integrity of purpose are now merely historical relics 
    in a seldom-visited museum that now also houses the American Constitution.

    attempts)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Maybe there are too many nuclear 
    power plants reducing the number of brain cells in the typical American cerebellum. 
    Maybe it's the food additives, the antidepressants, the electric power lines, 
    the cellphones, HAARP, subliminal images in advertising, backward masking 
    in the music, the elimination of important historical facts in our school 
    textbooks (anybody know about the Santa Clara decision? most important law 
    change in American history), the childhood immunizations, the flouride in 
    the water ... THIS LIST COULD FILL A BOOK </font>(Let's Fill It)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And everything on this list, from 
    aspartame to phthlates, has had a debilitating effect on the American psyche, 
    warped it in the minds of our soldiers from someone who would protect and 
    defend the people's God-given rights to home and happiness to someone who 
    mistakenly hallucinates real people with kerchiefs and lollipops into lifeless 
    figures in a video game, which become lifeless figures on a forlorn desert 
    roadway quickly forgotten on the way back to camp to get high. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly 
    the schools have something to do with it, and the media as well, as both have 
    altered the American psyche from one of compassionate seeker of justice to 
    self-destructive, self-hating narcissist. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hmm, 
    sounds like somebody we know, doesn't it? Can you say psycho-anal-y-sis? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And we arrive the big issue, the 
    one they call you an anti-Semite for talking about. Think about it, my friends. 
    All the media, all the schools, all the hospitals, all the movies, the entire 
    nation's phone system. Much, very much of the government. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    American mindset has changed over the past 40 years from live and let live 
    to follow the orders of our leaders, even if we know they are lying. Did you 
    ever wonder why that happened? Did you ever wonder who did that? </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Did

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AMERICAN EMPIRE</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Ivo Daalder and 
    James M. Lindsa</font>y</p>
  <p><br>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 100,000 American troops patrolling 
    Baghdad and other Iraqi cities retain &quot;absolute authority within Iraq,&quot; 
    declared their commander, Lt. Gen. David McKiernan. At the same time, AMERICAN 
    FORCES ARE BEING DEPLOYED IN A GRAND CRESCENT SURROUNDING THE GREATER MIDDLE 
    EAST, FROM THE BALKANS SOUTHEST TO DIJIBOUTI, EAST THROUGH THE PERSIAND GULF 
    REGION INTO PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN, AND NORTH INTO UZBEKISTAN AND KRYGYZTAN.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Little wonder that commentators 
    at home and abroad continually speak of a new American empire. In the last 
    six months alone, as debate on Iraq peaked, the phrase &quot;American empire&quot; 
    was mentioned nearly 1,000 times in news stories, while bookstores have been 
    quickly filling their shelves with freshly minted tomes on the subject.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On one side are those who urge 
    Washington to reject the imperial temptation. These voices can be found on 
    both the far right and the far left. Pat Buchanan, author of &quot;Republic 
    or Empire?&quot; and editor of the new American Conservative Weekly, is concerned 
    that the &quot;conservative movement has been hijacked and turned into a globalist, 
    interventionist, open borders ideology,&quot; which, he says, is a far cry 
    from the conservative movement he grew up with. Noam Chomsky, whose &quot;Hegemony 
    or Survival: America's Quest for Global Domination&quot; is scheduled for 
    publication in the fall, warns that the BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S &quot;FORTHRIGHT 
    DECLARATION THAT IT INTENDS TO RULE THE WORLD BY FORCE&quot;amounts to fanaticism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other side are the so-called 
    neoconservatives, who sayTHE UNITED STATES HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMAKE THE 
    WORLD IN ITS OWN IMAGE. The syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer, for 
    example, says American foreign policy should seek to transform the unipolar 
    moment of the 1990's into &quot;the unipolar era.&quot; William Kristol, the 
    editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, told Fox News recently: &quot;WE 
    NEED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF BEING STRONG. And if people want to say we're an 
    imperial power, fine.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some commentators go even further, 
    arguing that the problem is not too much American imperialism but too little. 
    In their eyes, Afghanistan taught that failed and failing states threaten 
    American security by providing safe havens for terrorists, drug traffickers, 
    transnational criminal networks and other no-goodniks. &quot;Given the historical 
    baggage that `imperialism' carries, there's no need for the U.S. government 
    to embrace the term,&quot; Max Boot, author of &quot;These Savage Wars of 
    Peace&quot; (Basic Books), wrote this week in USA Today. &quot;But it should 
    definitely embrace the practice.&quot; In Iraq this &quot;means imposing the 
    rule of law, property rights and other guarantees, at gunpoint if need be.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The British historian Niall Ferguson 
    makes a similar argument for an imperial America in his new book, &quot;Empire: 
    The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global 
    Power.&quot; The Bush administration and its supporters, not surprisingly, 
    recoil at any suggestion that their foreign policy is or should be imperial. 
    &quot;The metaphor is seductive yet vicious,&quot; complains Philip Zelikow, 
    director of the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs and 
    someone who helped draft the administration's national security strategy, 
    which was articulated last September.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Bush has been less direct 
    but no less definitive. In a speech to the American Enterprise Institute in 
    February, he committed the United States to rebuilding Iraq after the war. 
    &quot;America has made and kept this kind of commitment before &#151; in the 
    peace that followed a world war. After defeating enemies, we did not leave 
    behind occupying armies, we left constitutions and parliaments.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet for all the debate over whether 
    or not the United States should be an empire, that question is beside the 
    point. Like it or not, the power and reach of the United States have already 
    turned it into an empire. Indeed, it has been one in some form or another 
    for more than 100 years, ever since the United States triumphed in the Spanish-American 
    War and American troops occupied Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.And the American imperium did 
    not stop there. In 1903 Teddy Roosevelt engineered Panama's rebellion against 
    Colombia. The next year he asserted the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe 
    Doctrine. Washington not only had the right to keep European powers out of 
    the Western Hemisphere, it also had the right to exercise &quot;an international 
    police power&quot; against any country in the Americas engaged in &quot;chronic 
    wrongdoing.&quot; Over the next three decades, the Marines conducted long 
    occupations of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Nicaragua while fulfilling 
    Roosevelt's charge to restore &quot;the ties of civilized society.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE UNITED STATES DID GO MARCHING 
    HOME AGAIN AFTER WORLD WAR I. BUT IT DIDN'T AFTER WORLD WAR II. INSTEAD WASHINGTON 
    BUILT A WEB OF PERMANENTLY ENTANGLING ALLIANCES THAT STRETCHED AROUND THE 
    GLOBE. AT ONE POINT THE UNITED STATES HAD MILITARY BASES IN MORE THAN 70 COUNTRIES.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TODAY NO OTHER COUNTRY CAN BEGIN 
    TO MATCH THE REACH AND LETHALITY OF THE AMERICAN ARMED FORCES. Only the United 
    States can send bombers from its heartland on a round-trip mission to attack 
    targets anywhere around the globe and do so with great stealth, precision 
    and destructive force. Only the United States can quickly dispatch ground 
    forces in large numbers to any battlefield in the world and defeat any traditional 
    foe. Only the United States can deploy a truly blue-water navy across every 
    ocean, with 12 mammoth aircraft carriers each housing a modern air armada 
    larger than the entire air force of most countries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no doubt that the United 
    States can afford this vast military might. The American economy accounts 
    for 31 percent of the world's total output, as much as it did in the 1950's. 
    It is larger than that of the four next-largest national economies (Japan, 
    Germany, France and Britain) combined, and it accounts for almost half the 
    gross domestic product of the G-7 countries (which also include Canada and 
    Italy). At the same time, military spending consumes a smaller share of the 
    American gross domestic product today than it did a decade ago, and only about 
    half of what it did during the height of the cold war. &quot;Being No. 1 at 
    great cost is one thing,&quot; the Yale University historian Paul Kennedy 
    marvels. &quot;BEING THE WORLD'S SINGLE SUPERPOWER on the cheap is astonishing.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The real debate, then, is not whether 
    to have an empire, but what kind. Should America pursue a go-it-alone strategy 
    as it did in 1910, when the United States exerted its power largely at the 
    point of the bayonet and ignored the views of others? Or should it be the 
    empire of 1950, when Washington embedded American power in multilateral institutions 
    that reflected American interests but also constrained its freedom of action?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This question was the crux of the 
    dispute with the United Nations over whether to invade Iraq and the one preoccupying 
    the world now as the reconstruction begins. President Bush has made it clear 
    since Sept. 11 that he intends to lead, and other countries can follow or 
    get out of the way. HE AND HIS SUPPORTERS SAY THE UNITED STATES EMBODIES A 
    UNIQUE BLEND OF MIGHT AND RIGHT THAT CAN DELIVER A WORLD OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY 
    FOR ALL. To forsake that opportunity in a fit of self-doubt or excessive modesty, 
    they say, will only make Americans and all other peoples less secure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critics, by contrast, favor an 
    empire built on international cooperation, alliances and law. They argue that 
    is the only way to reassure countries fearful of American dominance AND KEEP 
    THEM FROM USING THEIR diplomatic and ECONOMIC POWER TO CONTAIN THE UNITED 
    STATES.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the Iraq war underscored, the 
    United States' great power enables it to act alone and still achieve many 
    of its goals swiftly and effectively. But over time such a unilateral exercise 
    of power will breed more and more resentment abroad to the point that other 
    states may decide to work together to obstruct the chosen American course. 
    THEN, THE UNITED STATES COULD STAND ALONE, A GREAT POWER FRUSTRATED IN THE 
    PURSUIT OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT GOALS.</font></p>

</div>
<div align="left"> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most everyone has heard of these 
    groups and some of the conspiracy theories surrounding them regarding the 
    development of the 'New World Order.' Now imagine for a moment there is something 
    to this (and there appears to be no lack of documented material justifying 
    these theories). That would mean that at almost every elevated level of business 
    and government, world wide, <font size="2">(certain)</font> men and women 
    have infiltrated, become the controlling administrators and are working to 
    effectively control every aspect of the life of the &quot;world citizen.&quot; 
    One aspect of this that has not been properly searched out is the &quot;religious&quot; 
    connection. Surely, given that much of the world is religious, and in the 
    currently reigning SuperPower nation of the U.S., predominantly &quot;Christian,&quot; 
    then it would only make sense that these organizations have infiltrated the 
    Church itself and are also actively leading it to into the New World Order 
    as well. Do the world's leading Christian evangelicals have ties to these 
    organizations? Yes they do, and it is thoroughly documented.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> REV. SUN MYUNG MOON (The Moonies), 
    AND THE UNIFICATION CHURCH</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For those few of you who are not 
    familiar with the Rev. Moon, in the 60s both he and his Unification Church 
    were universally regarded as a dangerous cult. The abuse his followers suffered 
    at the hands of their mind manipulating master is indeed very well established. 
    His claims include stating that Christ failed His mission, and that Moon himself 
    is the &quot;new messiah&quot; who is come to fulfill the mission of God. 
    He also claims that it is his mission to 'unite the world through uniting 
    religious forces'. But would it shock you to know that nearly all the big 
    name Christian evangelicals have extremely strong ties to him? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One such Church leader and internationally 
    recognized evangelical Christian, Jerry Falwell, readily admits that he accepted 
    2.5 million dollars from Moon in 1994 in order to bail out his Liberty University 
    in Lynchburg, Virginia. This was funneled through a Moon organization known 
    as the 'Womens Federation for World Peace' which has been chaired by Beverly 
    LaHaye, Wife of Timothy LaHaye, who is the popular co-author of the &quot;Left 
    Behind&quot; Christian fictional book series and a well known evangelical 
    Christian. The Womens Federation for World Peace paid 3.5 million to the Christian 
    Heritage Foundation, which in turn bought Falwell's $73 million debt, and 
    then frankly wrote it off. The Heritage Foundation then seems to have paid 
    themselves a fee of one million dollars for their trouble. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since that time Falwell has spoken 
    at many of Moons functions, embracing the cult-leader with unabashed reverence 
    and friendship. Even writings from Moons' Church confirm Falwells comradeship 
    with 'the new messiah' and his cult. Moon has even been a guest speaker in 
    mainline denominational Churches in the past few years. Falwell further praised 
    Rev. Moon calling him, &quot;An unsung hero to the cause of freedom, who is 
    to be commended for his determination and courage and endurance in support 
    of his beliefs.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to official court records 
    of a lawsuit that was filed in Bedford County Circuit Court (West Virginia), 
    it was alleged that Falwell and an associate flew to South Korea, January 
    9, 1994 to meet with Unification Church officials. This trip came shortly 
    before Falwell was awarded the Moon money. Falwell stated openly, &quot;If 
    the American Atheists Society or Saddam Hussein himself ever sent an unrestricted 
    gift to any of my ministries, be assured I will operate on Billy Sunday's 
    philosophy: The Devil's had it long enough, and quickly cash the check.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Falwell is not the only evangelical 
    reported to have accepted money from Rev. Moon. Other notable speakers for 
    Moon's organizations and affairs receiving as much as $80,000 to $150,000 
    have included Ralph Reed, Beverly LaHaye, Gary Bauer, and Robert Schuller, 
    well known for his &quot;Crystal Cathedral&quot; in Southern California and 
    &quot;Hour of Power&quot; 'positive-thinking' television ministry. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE COUNCIL OF NATIONAL POLICY 
    (CNP)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another Moon sponsored organization 
    is the Council of National Policy founded in 1981 by Tim LaHaye, the aforementioned 
    co-author of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; book series. It is reported that 
    he received $500,000 from a Mr. Bo Hi Pak, Moons #1 man, and a former Korean 
    CIA officer. Though a tape exists showing that LaHaye thanked Pak for the 
    money, LaHaye never denied the charge but verbally attacked the sources verifying 
    the allegation with a barrage of insult. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other members of the CNP have included 
    Beverly and Lee LaHaye, also associated with Moons CWA group. Gary Bauer, 
    Bill Bright, James Dobson (Focus On The Family), Bob Dugan, Ron Godwin, Robert 
    Grant, Rebecca Hagelin, Bob Jones the 3rd (Bob Jones University), Alan Keyes 
    (Outspoken ultra-conservative black talk show host and author), Dr. D. James 
    Kennedy (noted television evangelist and Pastor), Peter Marshall, Sam Moore 
    of Thomas Nelson Publishing, Pat Robertson (founder of the Christian Broadcasting 
    Network and former Presidential aspirant), Rev. Duane Motley, Ralph Reed, 
    Oliver North (formerly with the National Security Council), Phyllis Schlafly 
    (ultra-right columnist and pundit), Rev. Jim Woodall, John Ankerberg (internationally 
    recognized Christian television personality), Rev. E.V. Hill, James Robison, 
    Jay Sekulow (Attorney and activist for ultra-right/Christian causes), Pat 
    Boone, Larry Burkett, Reed Larson, and many others. Some of the political 
    leaders involved with the Moon sponsored CNP group include Senators Jesse 
    Helms, Don Nickles, and Trent Lott. Also Representatives Tom DeLay, Dan Burton, 
    and Bob Dornan.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Looking into some of the CNP officers 
    we find not only a just a strong association with Moon, but also powerful 
    ties with the CIA and the Council on Foreign Relations, not to mention association 
    with high level Freemasonry for which many conspiracy theorists have more 
    than a mere elementary knowledge related to the NWO. Another past President 
    of CNP is Rich DeVoss, co-founder of Amway (and 33rd degree Mason).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> COALITION FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
    (CRF)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another past Moon organization 
    was the 'Coalition for Religious Freedom' where again, Tim LaHaye held a paid 
    position as Chairman. It was formed by LaHaye after Moon was arrested for 
    tax evasion. Jerry Falwell, Jimmy Swaggart, James Robison, James Kennedy and 
    Rex Humbard, have all served as executive committee members. Other notables 
    to serve in Moons CRF include Hal Lindsey (Author of &quot;The Late Great 
    Planet Earth&quot;), Paul Crouch (Head of the Trinity Broadcasting Network), 
    Dr. D. James Kennedy and Don Wildman to name a few. CRF President Don Sills 
    admits that CRF has received no less than $500,000 from Moon sources. In 1984, 
    despite forces in government opposing the move, Moon was jailed for tax evasion 
    (sentenced to 18 Months in prison and fined $25,000). In a CRF sponsored rally 
    Tim Lahaye asked that people go to jail with Moon in protest. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNITY: A ONE WORLD RELIGION?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In light of the ties between nearly 
    all Christian &quot;evangelicals&quot; with Rev. Moon, the CIA, the Council 
    for Foreign Relations, the Trilateral commission, the Bush family and Bush 
    Sr's &quot;New World Order&quot;, is it any wonder that after the September 
    11th tragedy, Billy Graham prayed in the name of God, and Allah, as dignitaries 
    from many faiths were gathered before him? This prayer was broadcast the world 
    over. His call was for religious cooperation and 'unity of all faiths...Franklin 
    Graham's (son of world renowned evangelist Rev. Billy Graham, and heir to 
    the very lucrative and influential Billy Graham Evangelistic Ministries) answer 
    to a question by NBC's Tom Brokaw, ...&quot;it's very important that all the 
    faiths, all the denominations are coming together, cooperating together, working 
    together; it is a wonderful testimony to the spirit of America, and the dedication 
    of the American people.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moon also owns the Washington Times, 
    THE conservative voice of the nation. Though this establishment should have 
    gone under several years ago, Moon pours multi-millions of dollars annually 
    into this paper. He also owns the publication &quot;Insight&quot;. He indeed 
    owns many businesses and operates in media of several nations worldwide. In 
    Central America He is the owner of the &quot;Tiempos del Mundo&quot; (Times 
    of the World), another leading news publication, making him the conservative 
    voice there as well. In the early 1980s, Moon was shooting for the acclaim 
    of all of Central and South America. He met political opposition from Carlos 
    Menem, Argentinas President. His rescue came in the form of one man. That 
    man was George Bush Sr. former director of the CIA, former Vice President, 
    and former President of the United States of America. Bush was the principal 
    speaker at the Sheraton Hotel at a Moon sponsored event, with 800 to 900 guests 
    in attendance giving this manipulative operative remarkable credibility overnight. 
    Bush declared enthusiastically; &quot;...The editors of The Washington Times 
    tell me that never once has the man with the vision interfered with the running 
    of the paper, a paper that in my view brings sanity to Washington, D.C. I 
    am convinced that Tiempos del Mundo is going to do the same thing.&quot; <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both George and Barbara Bush made 
    several speeches in Asia in 1995. In Tokyo, Japan during one Moon rallying 
    function, over 50,000 pro-Moon advocates were addressed by the two. This was 
    sponsored by the Womens Federation for World peace. <br>
    It has also been speculated that Moon and Bush were seeking joint business 
    ventures in South America. An interesting fact is that despite over 30 years 
    of allegations (from some U.S. government officials seemingly out of the loop) 
    of Moons connections with the Korean CIA (and as we can now see the American 
    counterpart as well) no steps have been taken to deport him, let alone prosecute 
    him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CONCLUSION</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do Rev. Moon, leading Christian 
    evangelicals and the American government have in common? And, just what does 
    this have to do with the &quot;New World Order,&quot; as (re)coined by George 
    Bush Sr.? There can be no doubt that these dark elements of government, industry, 
    banking, and intelligence are leading us into their new world order, and their 
    influence has been extended to nearly every Christian in the world through 
    these leading evangelicals who claim to represent Christ. Perhaps this Rev. 
    Moon quote from August 4th 1996 may give us a little more &quot;insight&quot;...&quot;Americans 
    who continue to maintain their privacy and extreme individualism are foolish 
    people... The world will reject Americans who continue to be so foolish. Once 
    you have this great power of love, which is big enough to swallow entire America, 
    there may be some individuals who complain inside your stomach. However, they 
    will be digested.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Could this be the 'falling away' 
    of the Church so often preached by these same evangelicals? The great 'apostasy' 
    which will, in the last days render much of the Christian Church faithless 
    to their original calling and subject to the manipulation, will and prophesied 
    plans of the 'Antichrist'?</font></p>

  RELIGION </font></div>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By George Monbiot<br>
  The Guardian - UK<br>
  7-28-3 </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">US leaders now see themselves as 
  priests of a divine mission to rid the world of its demons...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The death of Uday and Qusay,&quot; 
  the commander of the ground forces in Iraq told reporters on Wednesday, &quot;is 
  definitely going to be a turning point for the resistance.&quot; Well, it was 
  a turning point, but unfortunately not of the kind he envisaged. On the day 
  he made his announcement, Iraqi insurgents killed one US soldier and wounded 
  six others. On the following day, they killed another three; over the weekend 
  they assassinated five and injured seven. Yesterday they slaughtered one more 
  and wounded three. This has been the worst week for US soldiers in Iraq since 
  George Bush declared that the war there was over. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Few people believe that the resistance 
  in that country is being coordinated by Saddam Hussein and his noxious family, 
  or that it will come to an end when those people are killed. But the few appear 
  to include the military and civilian command of the United States armed forces. 
  For the hundredth time since the US invaded Iraq, the predictions made by those 
  with access to intelligence have proved less reliable than the predictions made 
  by those without. And, for the hundredth time, the inaccuracy of the official 
  forecasts has been blamed on &quot;intelligence failures&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The explanation is wearing a little 
  thin. Are we really expected to believe that the members of the US security 
  services are the only people who cannot see that many Iraqis wish to rid themselves 
  of the US army as fervently as they wished to rid themselves of Saddam Hussein? 
  What is lacking in the Pentagon and the White House is not intelligence (or 
  not, at any rate, of the kind we are considering here), but receptivity. Theirs 
  is not a failure of information, but a failure of ideology. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To understand why this failure persists, 
  we must first grasp a reality which has seldom been discussed in print. THE 
  UNITED STATES IS NO LONGER JUST A NATION. IT IS NOW A RELIGION. Its soldiers 
  have entered Iraq to liberate its people not only from their dictator, their 
  oil and their sovereignty, BUT ALSO FROM THEIR DARKNESS. As George Bush told 
  his troops on the day he announced victory: &quot;Wherever you go, you carry 
  a message of hope - a message that is ancient and ever new. IN THE WORDS OF 
  THE PROPHET ISAIAH, 'TO THE CAPTIVES, &quot;COME OUT,&quot; AND TO THOSE IN 
  DARKNESS, &quot;BE FREE.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So American soldiers are no longer 
  merely terrestrial combatants; THEY HAVE BECOME MISSIONARIES. They are no longer 
  simply killing enemies; THEY ARE CASTING OUT DEMONS. The people who reconstructed 
  the faces of Uday and Qusay Hussein carelessly forgot to restore the pair of 
  little horns on each brow, but the understanding that these were opponents from 
  a different realm was transmitted nonetheless. Like all those who send missionaries 
  abroad, THE HIGH PRIESTS OF AMERICA conceive that the infidels might resist 
  through their own free will; if they refuse to convert, it is the work of the 
  devil, in his current guise as the former dictator of Iraq. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Clifford Longley shows in his 
  fascinating book Chosen People, published last year, the founding fathers of 
  the USA, though they sometimes professed otherwise, sensed that they were guided 
  by a divine purpose. THOMAS JEFFERSON ARUGUED THAT THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED 
  STATES SHOULD DEPICT THE ISRAELITES, &quot;LED BY A CLOUD BY DAY AND A PILLAR 
  OF FIRE BY NIGHT&quot;. George Washington claimed, in his inaugural address, 
  that every step towards independence was &quot;distinguished by some token of 
  providential agency&quot;. Longley argues that the formation of the American 
  identity was part of a process of &quot;supersession&quot;. The Roman Catholic 
  church claimed that it had supplanted the Jews as the elect, as the Jews had 
  been repudiated by God. The English Protestants accused the Catholics of breaking 
  faith, and claimed that they had become the beloved of God. The American revolutionaries 
  believed that the English, in turn, had broken their covenant: THAT AMERICANS 
  HAD NOW BECOME THE CHOSEN PEOPLE, WITH A DIVINE DUTY TO DELIVER THE WORLD TO 
  GOD'S DOMINION. Six weeks ago, as if to show that this belief persists, GEORGE 
  BUSH RECALLED A REMARK OF WOODROW WILSON'S. &quot;AMERICA,&quot; HE QUOTED, 
  &quot;HAS A SPIRITUAL ENERGY IN HER WHICH NO OTHER NATION CAN CONTRIBUTE TO 
  THE LIBERATION OF MANKIND.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gradually this notion of election 
  has been conflated with another, still more dangerous idea. It is not just that 
  the Americans are God's chosen people; America itself is now perceived as a 
  divine project. In his farewell presidential address, RONALD REAGAN SPOKE OF 
  HIS COUNTRY AS A &quot;SHINING CITY ON A HILL&quot; A REFERENCE TO THE SERMON 
  ON THE MOUNT. But what Jesus was describing was not a temporal Jerusalem, but 
  the kingdom of heaven. Not only, in Reagan's account, was God's kingdom to be 
  found in the United States of America, but the kingdom of hell could also now 
  be located on earth: the &quot;evil empire&quot; of the Soviet Union, AGAINST 
  WHICH HIS HOLY WARRIORS WERE PITCHED. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SINCE THE ATTACKS ON NEW YORK, THIS 
  NOTION OF AMERICA THE DIVINE HAS BEEN EXTENDED AND REFINED. In December 2001, 
  Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of that city, delivered his last mayoral speech IN 
  ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL, close to the site of the shattered twin towers. &quot;All 
  that matters,&quot; he claimed, &quot;is that you embrace America and understand 
  its ideals and what it's all about. Abraham Lincoln used to say THAT THE TEST 
  OF YOUR AMERICANISM WAS...HOW MUCH YOU BELIEVED IN AMERICA. BECAUSE WE'RE LIKE 
  A RELIGION REALLY. A SECULAR RELIGION.&quot; The chapel in which he spoke had 
  been consecrated not just by God, but by the fact that George Washington had 
  once prayed there. It was, he said, now &quot;sacred ground to people who feel 
  what America is all about&quot;. The United States of America no longer needs 
  to call upon God; it is God, and those who go abroad to spread the light do 
  so in the name of a celestial domain. THE FLAG HAS BECOME AS SACRED AS THE BIBLE; 
  THE NAME OF THE NATION AS HOLY AS THE NAME OF GOD.THE PRESIDENCY IS TURNING 
  INTO A PRIESTHOOD. </font>(Of course it already was the pulpit of the Wicked 
  Priest...See the chapter entitled The Teacher of (Un)Righteousness<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">)...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/GodAndCountry.jpg" width="300" height="227"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So those who question George Bush's 
  foreign policy are no longer merely critics; they are blasphemers, or &quot;anti-Americans&quot;. 
  Those foreign states which seek to change this policy are wasting their time: 
  you can negotiate with politicians; you cannot negotiate with priests. THE US 
  HAS A DIVINE MISSION, AS BUSH SUGGESTED IN JANUARY, &quot;TO DEFEND...THE HOPES 
  OF ALL MANKIND&quot;, and woe betide those who hope for something other than 
  the American way of life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dangers of national divinity 
  scarcely require explanation. Japan went to war in the 1930s convinced, like 
  George Bush, that it possessed a heaven-sent mission to &quot;liberate&quot; 
  Asia and extend the realm of its divine imperium. It would, the fascist theoretician 
  Kita Ikki predicted: &quot;LIGHT THE DARKNESS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD&quot;. Those 
  who seek to drag heaven down to earth are destined only to engineer a hell.</font></p>

  GENERAL WHO RIDICULES ISLAM AS 'SATAN.'</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON, Oct.16, 2003__Defense 
    Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld declined on Thursday to criticize a senior Pentagon 
    intelligence official who has told evangelical gatherings that Muslims worship 
    an &quot;idol&quot; and not a &quot;real God,&quot; and instead praised the 
    general's &quot;outstanding military record.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lt. General William Boykin of the 
    Army, deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence and war-fighting 
    support, has used speeches at churches and prayer breakfasts to portray the

    saying militant Islamists sought to destroy America &quot;BECAUSE WE'RE A 
    CHRISTIAN NATION.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NBC News broadcast videotapes of 
    General Boykin, AN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN, giving a number of speeches while 
    wearing his military uniform at religious functions around the country. In 
    one speech, the general recalled a Muslim fighter in Somalia who said American 
    forces would never get him because Allah would give him protection. &quot;When, 
    you know what I knew--that my God was bigger than his,&quot; General Boykin 
    told his audience. &quot;I knew that my God was a real God, and his was an 
    idol.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In another speech, General Boykin 
    said God had selected George W. Bush as president. &quot;WHY IS THIS MAN IN 
    THE WHITE HOUSE?&quot; he asked. &quot;THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DID NOT VOTE 
    FOR HIM. WHY IS HE THERE? AND I TELL YOU THIS MORNING THAT HE'S IN THE WHITE 
    HOUSE BECAUSE GOD PUT HIM THERE FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Describing America's fight with

    SATAN.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nihad Awad, of The Council on American-Islamic

    In The 'Age of Pharaoh'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Michael A. Hoffman II</font><br>
    <br>
    OSAMA CALLED BUSH PHARAOH WHILE THE PENTAGON ADOPTED PHARAOH'S SYMBOL<br>
    <br>
    &quot;For this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world,<br>
    that I should bear witness unto the truth.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a November communiqu&eacute; 
    attributed to &quot;Osama bin Laden,&quot; President George W. Bush was referred 
    to as &quot;the Pharaoh of this Age.&quot; Of course we have no way of knowing 
    if the communique (in the form of an audio-tape) actually comes from bin Laden, 
    or rather from the stellar nether regions of the Cryptocracy's drawer 13. 
    We content ourselves with analyzing the symbolism of the message itself and 
    its intended effect on its target audience. <br>
    <br>
    The signature symbolism of the western secret society known as Freemasonry 
    is derived from the icons of ancient Egypt, for example, the pyramid and sphinx 
    and the golden funeral mask of Tutankhamen. When Dr. Charles Eliot Norton 
    of Harvard University analyzed the Great Seal of the United States and pronounced 
    it &quot;a dull emblem of a masonic fraternity,&quot; he was pointing out 
    that one need not be a Harvard professor to grasp the blatant symbolism of 
    the eye-over-the-pyramid icon most famously reproduced on the U.S. one dollar 
    currency. The image on the dollar bill is of an unfinished monument of the 
    Pharaohs. When the top tier or capstone of the monument is put into place 
    by means of the panoptican surveillance system represented by the disembodied 
    &quot;All-Seeing&quot; Eye at the top of the pyramid, Pharaoh's rule will 
    have been reimposed upon the world. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../../UsedImages/PharonicSymbol.gif" width="318" height="318"></font></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Homeland Security - DARPA'S All-Seeing Eye</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <br>
    Among Biblically-literate people, &quot;Pharaoh&quot; has been a synonym for 
    rule characterized by chattel slavery and tyranny. &quot;Osama&quot; bin Laden 
    and his al-Qaeda network are said by the White House, the Establishment press 
    and their papal and Protestant partners in crime, to be Satanic and opposed 
    to God and the Bible. Yet the communique attributed to bin Laden this month 
    makes a Biblical identification of George W. Bush, as &quot;the Pharaoh of 
    the Age.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Osama&quot; bin Laden's well-publicized identification of Bush with 
    Pharaoh coincided with publicity in November for the Pentagon's &quot;Information 
    Awareness Office&quot; Surveillance System (IAO-SS). This massive, all-seeing 
    eye enterprise is part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), 
    headed by Admiral John Poindexter, the Reagan administration's arms purveyor 
    to the Islamic Republic of Iran. IAO-SS purports to capture a person's &quot;information 
    signature&quot; so that the government can track &quot;potential terrorists&quot; 
    and &quot;criminals&quot; involved in what it terms,&quot;low-intensity/low-density&quot; 
    forms of crime and warfare. <br>
    <br>
    The stated goal of this System is to track individuals throughout the earth 
    by using computer algorithms to detect &quot;potential terrorist activity.&quot; 
    The System aims to implement &quot;revolutionary technology for ultra-large, 
    all-source information repositories,&quot; which would create a &quot;virtual, 
    centralized, grand database.&quot; This database would include &quot;transaction 
    data&quot; contained in current databases, such as financial records, medical 
    records, telephone, mail, business and travel records, as well as unnamed 
    &quot;new sources of information.&quot; Intelligence data would also be fed 
    into the database. <br>
    <br>
    A crucial component of the project is the development of data &quot;mining&quot; 
    and &quot;knowledge discovery tools&quot; that can sift through the vast information 
    glut to discern &quot;patterns and associations.&quot; Another item on the 
    Pentagon's surveillance agenda is the deployment of biometric technology to 
    enable the identification and tracking of people. For example, DARPA funds 
    the &quot;Human ID at a Distance&quot; program, which aims to positively identify 
    people through technologies such as face recognition and &quot;gait&quot; 
    (walking pattern) recognition. <br>
    <br>
    The FDA recently approved the use of Applied Digital Solutions' VeriChip in 
    humans. The VeriChip is a tiny subcutaneous device that emits a 125-kilohertz 
    radio frequency signal containing a code number detectable by scanners up 
    to four feet away. The scanned code number is then downloaded to a computer 
    file containing all relevant data on the subject. The biochip implants are 
    officially said to be limited to tracking &quot;at risk&quot; children and 
    those with life-threatening ailments, but classified portions of the Pentagon's 
    biometric technology program include studies on the feasibility of biochip 
    implants in persons labeled &quot;unlawful combatants, terrorists, criminals&quot; 
    and &quot;networked fund-raisers and sympathizers.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The motto of the Pentagon's Information Awareness Office Surveillance System 
    is &quot;Scientia est Potentia&quot; (knowledge is power). The motto appears 
    in Latin in order to instill awe and by such priestcraft &quot;ad captandum 
    vulgus&quot; (dazzle the mob). The symbol of this new Pentagon agency is unmistakably 
    Pharaonic, exceeding even the pyramid on the dollar bill in the boldness of 
    its revelatory daring. The icon of the Information Awareness Office is an 
    adaptation of the familiar All-Seeing Eye atop the pyramid, but with a newly 
    added and paradoxical feature -- rays from the Eye are shown irradiating the 
    earth's western hemisphere, rather than the Middle East. The exclusively western 
    range of the Eye pertains to masonic doctrine concerning the geographic domain 
    of Anubis, the dog-headed deity of Egypt's astronomic state religion. <br>
    <br>
    While it may not take a Harvard professor to recognize that this symbol is 
    thoroughly inimical to the God of the Bible and Christianity, the symbolic 
    import of the Pentagon's new icon, will indeed be consciously lost (though 
    subconsciously registered) on the masses of Judeo-Christians herded by their 
    pulpit-pounding crypto-rabbis into the delusion that George W. Bush is the 
    paladin of Christendom and goodness, and the Islamic resistance the paradigm 
    of deviltry and darkness. <br>
    <br>
    Throughout my writing about subjects such as the Cryptocracy, the &quot;loyal 
    opposition&quot; of people like Pat Buchanan, the 9/11 conspiracy and lately, 
    the D.C. Sniper(s), I have directed readers' attention toward the curious 
    mechanism of the Making Manifest of All that is Hidden, wherein our rulers 
    symbolically reveal the evil nature of their rule to us. One purpose of this 
    Revelation of the Method is to instill a bipolar orientation and double-mind 
    in the populace, in the expectation that the people will not consciously face 
    the consequences of the revelation, and hence will continue to follow and 
    obey the ruler even in the wake of the revelation that the ruler is another 
    Pharaoh. The ruler then harvests and exploits the resulting, inevitable, profound 
    emotional and intellectual malaise and psychological disturbance for his own 
    purposes. The unchallenged, successful induction of this civic insanity is 
    a hallmark on the path to the reimposition of Pharaoh's rule. <br>
    <br>
    The Pentagon is on record boasting of the stealth, deception and psychological 
    warfare it uses on its enemies. If one considers the possibility, in the wake 
    of government atrocities such as Ruby Ridge and Waco, that the US government 
    regards the American people themselves as a potential enemy, in that they 
    pose at least a distant threat of resistance and revolt, one might reasonably 
    consider the likelihood that some form of psychological warfare is being directed 
    at us by &quot;our own&quot; government. <br>
    <br>
    The recognition of the existence of this induced civic insanity and its arcane 
    provenance, is the key to understanding why the American people cheer their 
    own executioners; why online &quot;conservatives&quot; like Joseph Farah, 
    who claim to be implacable foes of Big Brother tyranny, are complicit in ensuring 
    the implementation of that tyranny by crusading for a war on terror that is 
    pursued with state terror. <br>
    <br>
    This induced insanity could also account for the behavior of a &quot;populist 
    dissident&quot; like Mr. Buchanan, who wishes to be identified with opposition 
    to Zionist zealotry and alien immigration, yet who repeatedly drapes himself 
    in the mantle and mantra of Ronald Reagan, the president whom Yitzhak Shamir 
    called the best friend Israel ever had; the president who ignited the greatest 
    land invasion of American territory in our nation's history with the Simpson-Mazzoli 
    amnesty act. <br>
    <br>
    This may also explain the suppression of this writer's books which reveal, 
    as never before, the inner pyrotechnics of the &lt;&gt;secret societies, of 
    the &lt;&gt;religion of Judaism and the &lt;&gt;Israeli holocaust against 
    the Palestinians. These books are tightly suppressed not only by the usual 
    suspects, but even by alleged allies who supposedly are fervently desirous 
    of obtaining the most potent antidote to the toxins poisoning our people in 
    this, the desperate last stand for the future of our children. They know of 
    me and of the work, yet they have neglected to use their positions to lend 
    a hand and spread the word. Some have even engaged in active obstruction. 
    As Ezra Pound observed, &quot;A man often fails when his friends fail him.&quot; 
    <br>
    <br>
    As stated at the outset, it's not cetain that the November &quot;bin Laden 
    terror tape&quot; is authentic. What is of interest is the high media profile 
    accorded it, and the title &quot;Pharaoh of the Age,&quot; and the tape's 
    ascription of that title to our President. Given the Bush administration's 
    Pentagon enhancement of American Freemasonry's historic Pharaonic edifice-complex, 
    it seems that the statement about Bush which has been attributed to bin Laden, 
    contains a startling truth about the President of the United States from an 
    unlikely source, indeed, from the very planetary bogeyman currently haunting 
    our dreams; though I would not be surprised to learn that the tape actually 
    emanated, by a circuitous route, from psyop impersonators within DARPA itself, 
    as part of the Revelation of the Method. <br>
    <br>
    Behind the facade of ordinariness in which our &quot;news&quot; and &quot;current 
    events&quot; are situated, is a pageant, and within that pageant is a psychodrama 
    whose subterranean root is a game, Kim's &quot;great game.&quot; And who was 
    Kim, but a scion of Walsingham, Cecil, Dee and the Maharal. And until such 
    stuff as men are made of (as Shakespeare said of noble Brutus), arise again 
    to break the pattern and smash this process by single-minded devotion, we 
    shall continue to squirm in double-minded awe at the thrilling role assigned 
    us, as pawns in Pharaoh's game. <br>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">August 24, 2003__How 
      long is it going to take for us to recognize that the war we so foolishly 
      started in Iraq is a fiasco--tragic, deeply dehumanizing and ultimately 
      unwinnable? How much time and how much money AND HOW MANY WASTED LIVES IS 
      IT GOING TO TAKE?</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the United Nations 
      yesterday, grieving diplomats spoke bitterly, but not for attribution, about 
      the U.S.-led invasion and occupation. They said it has not only resulted 
      in the violent deaths of close and highly respected colleagues, but has 
      also galvanized the most radical elements of Islam. &quot;This is a dream 
      for the jihad,&quot; said one high ranking U.N. official. &quot;The resistance 
      will only grow. The American occupation is now the focal point, drawing 
      people from all over Islam into an eye-to-eye confrontation with the hated 
      Americans.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is very 
      propitious for the terrorists,&quot; he said.&quot;The U.S. is now on the 
      soil of an Arab country, a Muslim country, where the terrorists have all 
      the advantages. They are fighting in a terrain which they know and the U.S. 
      does not know, with cultural images the U.S. does not understand, and with 
      a language the American soldiers do not speak...&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The American people 
      still do not have a clear understanding of why we are in Iraq. And the troops 
      don't have a clear understanding of their mission. We're fighting a guerilla 
      war, which the bright lights at the Pentagon never saw coming, with conventional 
      forces...</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The carnage from 
      riots, ambushes, firefights, suicide bombings, acts of sabotage, friendly 
      fire incidents and other deadly encounters is growing. And so is the hostility 
      toward U.S. troops and Americans in general. WE ARE PAYING A TERRIBLE HIGH 
      PRICE--FOR WHAT?... Instead of democracy blossoming in the desert, we have 
      the reality of continuing bloodshed and heightened terror--THE PAYOFF OF 
      A POLICY SPUN FROM FANTASIES AND LIES....</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. cannot 
      bully its way to victory in Iraq. It needs allies, and it needs a plan...A 
      U.N. aide told me: &quot;The United States is the No. 1 enemy of the Muslim 
      world, and right now it's sitting on the terrorist's doorstep. It needs 
      help. It needs friends.&quot; </font>The New York Times<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON (CNN) --It has had 
      several names.In World Wars I and II, it was called shell shock, or combat 
      fatigue; in Vietnam, post traumatic stress disorder. But the cause and effect 
      was always the same -- exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which 
      grave physical harm occurred or was threatened, resulting in crushing depression 
      and anxiety. And like the warriors of the past, coalition forces in Iraq 
      are coming home to find that when you leave the battlefield, it does not 
      always leave you.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Some days I'm just sitting 
      in my rack here, just thinking about what we did over the war, and those 
      two bodies always stick out in my head. Or sometimes you dream about it 
      and you just wake up and you're in a sweat,&quot; says Marine Sgt. Anthony 
      Riddle. In Iraq, Corporal Casey Brommer remembers the trip along the Tigris 
      River to Baghdad and coming under fire. &quot;We called in with some artillery 
      and some napalm. Some innocent women and child got hit. They came out. We 
      met them on the road and they had little girls with noses blown off and 
      husbands carrying their dead wives,&quot; Brommer recalls. &quot;That was 
      extremely difficult to deal with because, you're like, what the hell do 
      we do now?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Pentagon is taking 
      steps to identify service members struggling to cope. Everyone coming home 
      is screened for health problems -- including mental health which involves 
      a battery of questions about psychological trauma. Questions like, &quot;Did 
      you see anyone wounded, killed, or dead?&quot; &quot;Have you had experiences 
      that were so frightening, horrible, or upsetting ... that you've had nightmares?&quot;Army 
      psychiatrist Col. Jim Stokes says, &quot;It's probable more people are feeling 
      it than are showing it. So many of these people feel they can't talk about 
      it because everyone else seems to be taking it so well.&quot; Getting troops 
      into therapy isn't easy and it's seen as a career ender, a sign of weakness 
      in a macho culture. &quot;When you talk to your other Marines, you want 
      to try to sound hard ... It ain't no big deal. But really you're thinking:

</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bob Woodward's deferent, perhaps 
  even obeisant homage to &quot;Dubya&quot; in his recent book, Bush at War, contains 
  this troubling observation: &quot;The President was casting his mission and 
  that of the country in the grand vision of God's Master Plan.&quot; This frightening 
  perception followed the President's declamation, &quot;We will export death 
  and violence to the four corners of the earth in defense of this great country 
  and rid the world of evil.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Considering how Bush Jr. grew up 
  beneath the Reagan/Bush baldacchino and then helped guide his father's ascension 
  to the throne, his connections with the Christian Right has a long and deep 
  history, including familiarity with the pseudo-prophet, Hal Lindsey, a frequent 
  visitor to the Reagan White House.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lindsey, the New York Times &quot;Best 
  Selling Author&quot; of the past three decades, author of at least 20 books 
  like The Late Great Planet Earth, and influential Father of Christian Zionism, 
  foresees the imminent and unavoidable great battle of Armageddon, the fulfillment 
  of John's prophecy in the Book of Revelation, the cataclysmic conflict between 
  the forces of Good against the forces of Evil, climaxing in our lifetime. Jesus 
  Christ, King of the Jews, will return to rule the world from the rebuilt temple 
  in the reclaimed nation of Israel according to the prophecies, and we will witness 
  the inevitable suffering and global holocaust. Lindsey proclaims deliverance 
  from Armageddon depends on understanding God's purposes for the Jews including 
  the restoration of Israel as a nation in the land of Judea and Samaria.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lindsey also proclaims that he purposefully 
  writes these books to shock people into believing in Jesus Christ as their Lord 
  and Savior. And like any good insurance salesman, he instills fear as he threatens 
  his customers with the plagues revealed in the Acts of the Apostles and the 
  Book of Revelation: &quot;... The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the 
  moon into blood....With Justice he judges and makes war ... He is dressed in 
  a robe dipped in blood and his name is the word of God ... Out of his mouth 
  comes a sharp sword with which to strike down nations. .so you may eat the flesh 
  of kings, generals, and mighty men, of horses and their riders, and the flesh 
  of all people, free and slave, small and great&quot; The Messiah slays the Antichrist 
  and &quot;creates a new heaven and a new earth&quot; and He judges the dead, 
  saves the Christians, and casts the rest into eternal perdition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lindsey accepts as reality that his 
  interpretations of the prophecies come directly to him from God, &quot;I believe 
  that the Spirit of God gave me a special insight, not only into how John described 
  what he actually experienced, but also into how this whole phenomenon encoded 
  the prophecies so that they could be fully understood only when their fulfillment 
  drew near ... I prayerfully sought for a confirmation for my apocalypse code 
  theory...&quot; This self-proclaimed, God inspired interpreter of the Bible 
  has had a profound influence on American and British Christians and Jews. Since 
  Ronald Reagan's Christian based regime of the '80s which included access to 
  the President by not only Lindsey, but Jerry Falwell and the Christian Zionist 
  televangelist Mike Evans, the interests of Zionism as an integral component 
  of prophetic lure have been central in policy formation toward Israel in particular 
  and the mid-east generally in both America and the United Kingdom. The current 
  administration, even more so than Reagan's, is rife with right-wing reliance 
  on the coming revival predicted in the Book of Revelation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider observations made by Paul 
  Krugman of the New York Times December 18, 2002: &quot;Tom DeLay soon to be 
  House majority leader, told a church group that: 'Only Christianity offers a 
  way to live in response to the realities that we find in this world &shy; only 
  Christianity.' He also said he was on a mission from God to promote a 'biblical 
  worldview' in American politics.&quot; This from the most powerful man in the 
  Congress! And he is not alone. According to Krugman, many leading Congressional 
  Republicans belong to the &quot;secretive&quot; Council for National Policy, 
  an organization founded by Tim LaHaye, co-author of the apocalyptic &quot;Left 
  Behind&quot; novels. Members include Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Sen. Jesse Helms, 
  Congressman Dick Armey and Tom DeLay of Texas, Howard Phillips, and many, many 
  others. This fundamentalist group listens, in private, to none other than the 
  self-proclaimed &quot;Born Again&quot; Christian, George W. Bush. Consider also 
  the appointment of John Ashcroft to the position of Attorney General, a vocal 
  Christian fundamentalist who &quot;gives every appearance of placing his biblical 
  worldview above secular concerns...&quot; Add to this the neo-cons in the administration 
  like Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Pearle, Feith, and many others, and one understands 
  that the ties that bind the neocon Christian right, read Christian Zionists, 
  to the Zionist orthodox Jew cement mentalities that embrace myths as truth and 
  behavior directed by superstitious beliefs, regardless of those who do not share 
  their zeal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe that the views expressed 
  by Hal Lindsey as they are reflective of beliefs held by &quot;Dominionists,&quot; 
  including Dr. Tony Evans, founder of Promise Keepers, Dr. Martin Hawkins, Assistant 
  to Evans, James Ryle of the Vineyard Movement among others, permeate the Bush 
  administration's major figures, most especially the President, guide their approach 
  to foreign policy, and transform their perception of themselves as executers 
  of God's will. The potential destructive power inherent in this mentality, that 
  accepts as truth interpretations of mythological stories or willingly uses those 
  interpretations to exhort others to action, can be understood and can be thwarted 
  before such devastation occurs. That conclusion we can draw from history should 
  we consider the destructive power of myth as it was wielded by Urban II as he 
  inaugurated the Crusades to liberate Jerusalem, Innocent III when he exterminated 
  the Cathar sect in the 12th and 13th centuries, the Puritan divines when they 
  slaughtered the Pequot Indians in 1636-37, and the elimination of the beliefs 
  extant in northern Europe before the onslaught of Christianity in the middle 
  ages, to offer a few examples. When the elite few who gain power in a country 
  or over a group of people accept myths as truth, or when they insidiously and 
  ruthlessly use the beliefs people hold to affect their ends, devastation follows. 
  An enlightened American public can thwart the myth driven elite. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michael Ortiz Hill, author of Dreaming 
  the End of the World, characterizes Bush, in his essay in CounterPunch January 
  4, 2003, as &quot;...delusional and the shape of his delusion is specifically 
  apocalyptical in belief and intent.&quot; By apocalyptical Hill means that &quot;All 
  systems are supposed to go down so the Messiah can come and Bush, seemingly, 
  has taken on the role of the one who brings this to pass.&quot; &quot;God sovereignly 
  controls all aspects of life&quot; according to this view, and that understanding 
  is inherent in the teachings of the Promise Keepers Movement and its founder, 
  Dr. Tony Evans, and the perspective of Billy Graham, two of the prominent right-wing 
  Christians who have influenced Bush. Graham is credited with Bush's rebirth 
  in Christ and Dr. Tony Evans is pastor of a large Dallas church where Bush heard 
  a great deal about &quot;how the world should be seen from a divine viewpoint&quot; 
  according to Dr. Martin Hawkins, assistant to Evans. (Hill).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both the Promise Keepers and the 
  Vineyard Movements according to Gary Gilley in &quot;The Vineyard Movement&quot; 
  accept the doctrine of &quot;end time&quot; or &quot;dominionism&quot; that 
  believes there will be a seizure of earthly power by God's people (read Christians) 
  to restore the earth to God's control. Dominion theology teaches that Christ 
  restored dominion over life to the followers of Christ, but the church now has 
  the obligation of redeeming society in order to bring about the Second Coming. 
  They also contend that the kingdom of God is now and they have the responsibility 
  to manifest God's power before the entire world. Taking control of the earth 
  must happen before Christ will return to usher in the physical kingdom on earth 
  over which He will reign.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Christian Zionists also believe 
  that, before Christ can return, the Jews must return to Israel. Many evangelical 
  Christians cite Genesis 12 and 13 to demonstrate that &quot;the Jews have title 
  deed to Israel and that the land must not be given back to the Palestinians,&quot; 
  according to Thomas Williamson in his article &quot;To Whom Does the Land of 
  Palestine Belong?&quot; Christian Zionists, according to Williamson, &quot;regard 
  God's covenant with Abraham, including the land grant, as an unconditional covenant.&quot; 
  More frighteningly, &quot;Every act taken by Israel is orchestrated by God, 
  and should be condoned, supported, and even praised by the rest of us,&quot; 
  notes Grace Halsell in her article &quot;Israeli Extremists and Christian Fundamentalists: 
  The Alliance.&quot; Not all Christians accept this interpretation, but for those 
  who do, the reestablishment of Israel in 1948 ushered in the conditions necessary 
  to bring about the rapture: Jewish control of Jerusalem and rebuilding the temple. 
  Then and only then can the final, great battle called Armageddon begin. Estimates 
  vary, but Halsell claims &quot;10 to 40 million Americans believe Palestine 
  is God's chosen land for the Jews&quot;(1). Maintenance of Israel as a nation 
  becomes an obligation on the part of Christian Zionists if Biblical prophecy 
  is to be fulfilled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That places George W. Bush in a unique 
  position as a leader of the world's mightiest military power: to bring about 
  the fulfillment of God's prophecy. Hill claims that Bush has accepted this eschatology 
  through which he sees himself &quot;as an agent of God who has been called by 
  him to 'restore the earth to God's control'&quot; (2). S.R. Shearer of Antipas 
  Ministries, notes Hill, calls this delusional. Hill refers to Bob Woodward's 
  new book, Bush at War, to give substance to this Messianic view of the President. 
  Woodward observes &quot;The president was casting his mission and that of the 
  country in the grand vision of God's Master Plan&quot; (2). Add to these comments 
  the closing sentence of his 2003 State of the Union Speech, &quot;The liberty 
  we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity,&quot; 
  and we can sense his Messianic fervor as he leads the world against the &quot;man-made&quot; 
  forces of evil. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, the determination 
  of that evil resides in the beliefs of those interpreting the &quot;prophecies&quot; 
  and those who accept those interpretations as truth. For Lindsey and the Vineyard 
  ministers, God's covenant with the Jews is truth and it translates, according 
  to Stephen R. Sizer, into the need for America to &quot;continue military and 
  economic funding of Israel,&quot; for Israel to &quot;resist negotiating land 
  for peace,&quot; &quot;maintain their apartheid policies,&quot; and incite fundamentalist 
  groups to destroy the Dome of the Rock so the new temple can be built. Lindsey 
  accuses those who refuse to accept this eschatology as anti-Semitic. This transition 
  from biblical prophecy to current events translates myth into international 
  policy emphasizing the potential destructive power of mythology. Who are these 
  self-appointed servants of the Almighty who give direction to Israeli and US 
  leaders regarding the establishment of nation states, the conception and determination 
  of evil, and the righteousness of actions taken on behalf of their interpretation 
  of God's word? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lindsey believes, as we have noted, 
  that the Spirit of God has given him special insight &quot;into how this whole 
  phenomenon encoded the prophecies&quot; Others like James Ryle of Promise Keepers 
  find God giving revelation through dreams and visions; in Hippo in the Garden, 
  he notes that he was called to preach through a prophetic word situation (91). 
  In either case, their interpretations come from an indeterminable source, yet 
  a source of vast power and consequence. Lindsey writes &quot;Only now, as mankind 
  approaches the third millennium, do I feel like the Holy Spirit has provided 
  me with the proper perspective &shy; the Big Picture, so to speak &shy; on the 
  mind blowing experiences of the modern world&quot; (Planet Earth 2000 A.D.). 
  And what are those &quot;mind blowing experiences&quot;? &quot;I am certain 
  The Second Advent will occur in the next few years &shy; probably in your lifetime.&quot; 
  And, &quot;the greatest threat to freedom and world peace today &shy; is Islamic 
  fundamentalism&quot; (The Final Battle). Acceptance of these modern day prophets 
  and their beliefs by the elite in power portends disaster for American policy 
  in the mid-east in particular and for American interests generally. But, as 
  we have seen, these ministers of God have the ear of those in power in the current 
  administration. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two issues arise immediately: why 
  should America determine its future course based on interpretations of God's 
  word as contained in documents 2500 years old, designed and written for civilizations 
  long dead? And, second, what is the evil that these modern day prophets determine 
  as the threat against God's predictions? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plainly, the Books of Genesis, Daniel, 
  and Revelation, the primary sources for &quot;end-time theology,&quot; for &quot;Dominionism,&quot; 
  for the Apocalyptic perspective, and for Armageddon, while accepted by literalists 
  as the word of God, are in fact derivatives of stories and ideas from other 
  cultures that anti-date Moses by hundreds of years and John, the purported author 
  of Revelation, by more than 1700 years. How then can they be the word of God? 
  How can Americans take seriously the interpretations of Pseudo-prophets who 
  claim to know the meaning of prophecies when they are only the latest in a series 
  of such claimants that date back to Joachim of Fiore, an Italian monk of the 
  12th century, Christopher Columbus in the early 1500s, Martin Luther, Thomas 
  Muentzer in the 16th century, the Puritans in America, the interpretations arising 
  out of Nazism and Marxism, William Miller and John Darby to mention a few who 
  appeared before the most recent group headed by Lindsey (PBS).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There can be no doubt that the Book 
  of Revelation has had a searing impact on the American conscience that dates 
  back to the establishment of God's &quot;city on a hill&quot; given to the Puritan's 
  by God Himself. The absolute acceptance of the forces of good and evil as extant 
  and operative in the world, concepts that date back to influences from ancient 
  Greece and Persia in the 5th to 3rd centuries before Christ, existed without 
  question in the Puritan mind. Hope in the eventual victory of the forces of 
  good over evil, however, existed long before the 5th century BCE in the &quot;Enuma 
  and Elish&quot; stories of the struggles between chaos and order that date to 
  1780 BCE in Mesopotamia. These myths tell of Marduk, the God of light, struggling 
  against Tiamat, the force of evil, to bring order out of chaos and peace to 
  the world (www.gatewaystobabylon.com). The influence of these myths on the Book 
  of Genesis, purportedly written by Moses who was born in 1571, is unmistakable 
  and conveyed directly in Psalm 74:14,15,16. But Marduk is not Yahweh, yet current 
  pseudo-prophets will declare the accuracy of their visions as direct from God 
  who speaks to humankind from the pages of the Old and New Testaments. They fail 
  to account for the origins of God's word that comes from non-Jewish sources. 
  Many ancient myths influenced the Bible: the burning of the world by the Hindu 
  God, Shiva; the Akkadian prophecies from Mesopotamia; the messiah-like king 
  that takes over the world, rewards the just, and rules forever from the Uruk 
  Prophecy; and the judgment of the dead by the Egyptian god Maat for the good 
  and evil they performed in their lifetime. (Patricia Eddy, &quot;The Persian 
  Connection: the End of the World Begins&quot;)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judaism also borrowed &quot;angels, 
  the holy spirit, paradise in heaven, eternal life, Judgment Day, the resurrection 
  of the dead, a fiery hell, a messianic savior, and man's personal responsibility 
  to do God's will&quot; from Persia (http://www.alsopreview.com)/. These same 
  concepts exist in Zoroaster's faith that prevailed in the 6th century BCE. He 
  designed a monotheistic God, Ahura Mazda, considered by some as a precursor 
  of the God of the Judaic Bible. Zoroaster's last battle between the forces of 
  good and evil, the biblical Armageddon, is headed by a messiah known as Saoshyant; 
  upon victory, he would herald in a millennium of peace and plenty. An apocalypse 
  preceded that last battle to gain the attention of the people. Indeed, the Book 
  of Revelation enlarges upon Zoroaster's end of the world concepts as do sections 
  in the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947 at Nag Hammadi and date to the 1st 
  and 2nd centuries CE. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, Christians reading 
  this literature have focused on the necessary and inevitable return of the Jews 
  to Judea-Samaria as conveyed in one source written by a monk in 950 CE, Adso 
  of Montier-En-Der at the request of Queen Gerbera of France as he interpreted 
  biblical passages. He also noted that there would arise &quot;the Last World 
  Emperor&quot; who would unite Christianity and defeat Muslims before the Antichrist 
  arises (PBS). This Christian Zionist focus that requires the fulfillment of 
  the covenant between God and His chosen people arises from two broad predictions 
  in the Old Testament: predictions of a return to Palestine from the Babylonian 
  exile and promises of Palestine as the land given by God to the Jews.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Scholars argue about these predictions, 
  some claiming that God fulfilled His promises when the Jews returned to Palestine, 
  rebuilt the Temple and the Walls of Jerusalem, and restored the religious life 
  of the community under the Maccabees; others disagree (http://www.users.cloud9.net/). 
  Citations of God's promises to &quot;the descendants of Abraham&quot; for land 
  appear in Genesis 12:7, 13:15, 15:18, 28:13-14 among others. The dispute caused 
  by these passages has to do with the &quot;seed&quot; to which God promised 
  the land. Zionists argue that God's promise was to Jews only; others argue that 
  the seed of Abraham includes Arabs (www.mideastfacts.com). Regardless of these 
  indeterminable disputes, &quot;prominent evangelists preach to their followers 
  that God never fulfilled &quot;His promise of giving all the land of Palestine 
  to the Jews&quot; (http://www.mideastfacts.com/) and, consequently, support 
  &quot;whatever action necessary, even nuclear war, to obtain Arab lands in the 
  Middle East and give them to Jews.&quot; [emphasis mine] (mideastfacts) Obviously, 
  such interpretations bring the world to the brink of nuclear holocaust and represent 
  to many in the Christian community a backward step in theology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is it possible to believe in the 
  21st century that a God, designed by a small tribe of nomadic Semites 3500 years 
  ago from stories and myths that existed centuries before in the literatures 
  of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan, and elsewhere, could dictate to Americans 
  how they should conduct foreign policy? Myths after all are stories that explain 
  for a people how they perceive their existence in a world filled with mystery 
  and awe. They create reference points for the people to see connections between 
  their condition and forces greater than themselves or to understand how they 
  must relate to the society that surrounds them or to grapple with the internal 
  energies that reside within themselves. Yet we have in the union of Christian 
  Zionists and Jewish Zionists mentalities that find absolute truth in these myths 
  and willingly inflict them on the American populace. These beliefs bring ancient 
  prophecies from myths into today's political arena as this comment from Lindsey's 
  Planet makes all too clear: &quot;The dispute to trigger the war of Armageddon 
  will arise between the Arabs and Israelis over the Temple Mount and Old Jerusalem 
  (Zachariah 12:2-3), the most contested and strategic piece of real estate in 
  the world Two religions, Judaism and Islam, thus are on a collision course with 
  global and heavenly repercussions. Islam will never accept Jerusalem as the 
  undivided capital of the Jewish state, and Israel will never agree to give it 
  up&quot;(155).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider the comments of Margot Patterson 
  in the National Catholic Reporter last October 11, 2002: &quot;Thousands of 
  Christian Zionists met in Jerusalem for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot to cheer 
  Sharon and to declare their unconditional support for the state of Israel.&quot; 
  These people embrace &quot;end-time&quot; theology and are supported in turn 
  by right-wing Israelis who like the economic and political support they bring 
  to the Israeli cause. Christian fundamentalists and Jewish Messianic settlers, 
  according to Patterson, promise formation of a &quot;Greater Israel&quot; that 
  will usher in Armageddon. They, too, see war between Muslims and Jews as bringing 
  about the Second Coming. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patterson quotes a variety of sources 
  to enforce her perception of the political impact these interpreters of God's 
  word have on America's policies toward Israel and Palestine. James Zogby, President 
  of the Arab American Institute, argues &quot;despite disclaimers to the contrary 
  the US is waging a war on Islam at home and abroad even as it tacitly supports 
  extremist settlers in the occupied territories Israel controls.&quot; Lewis 
  Roth, President of Americans for Peace Now, says &quot;You have a number of 
  very conservative Christian groups that support settlements because they see 
  this as a way of strengthening Jewish hold on the land of Israel because in 
  their mind this is important for end-of-time theology and part of hastening 
  the Second Coming and the conversion of the Jews&quot; Since Jews have their 
  own Messianic reading of the biblical sources, different from the Christian 
  Zionists except in the necessity of fulfilling God's covenant to return the 
  Jews to Judea-Samaria, they find support of the Christian Zionists helpful in 
  bringing about the creation of Greater Israel that would include not only the 
  borders of the present state but the entire land of Israel described in the 
  Hebrew Scriptures. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider as well Robert Kaiser's 
  February 9, 2003 article &quot;Bush and Sharon Nearly Identical on Mideast Policy&quot; 
  in the Washington Post. Kaiser quotes Richard Pearle, chairman of the Pentagon's 
  Defense Policy Board, &quot;Israel should insist on Arab recognition of its 
  claim to the biblical land of Israel and should focus on removing Saddam Hussein 
  from power in Iraq;&quot; this despite multiple UNSC resolutions that declare 
  Israel in defiance of international law by holding on to these lands. But there's 
  more! Douglas Feith, undersecretary of defense for policy, has written extensively 
  on Israeli-Arab issues, and argues, according to Kaiser, &quot;that Israel has 
  as legitimate a claim to the West Bank territories seized after the Six-Day 
  War as it has to the land that was part of the U.N. mandated Israel created 
  in 1948.&quot; Indeed, Donald Rumsfeld has made the same claim even as he demands 
  that the UN force nations that defy UN resolutions to comply: &quot;There was 
  a war and they (neighboring countries) lost a lot of real estate to Israel because 
  Israel prevailed in that conflict.&quot; Here are America's Defense Department 
  spokesmen directly contradicting the UN resolutions demanding that Israel comply 
  with international law and the Geneva Conventions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why do these individuals speak for 
  America in this manner? Kaiser quotes a senior official of the first Bush administration 
  as saying &quot;Sharon played the president like a violin: 'I'm fighting your 
  war, terrorism is terrorism,' and so on, Sharon did a masterful job.&quot; Rabbi 
  Yechiel Eckstein, also quoted by Kaiser, claims &quot;President Bush's policy 
  stems from his core as a Christian, his perceptions of right and wrong, good 
  and evil, and of the need to stand up and fight against evilI personally believe 
  it is very personal, not a political maneuver on his part.&quot; Rev. Richard 
  Land of the Southern Baptist Convention echoed those sentiments when he noted 
  how important evangelical support for the president is and claimed, &quot;We 
  need to bless Israel more than America needs Israel's blessing because Israel 
  has a far greater ally than the United States of America, God Almighty.&quot; 
  That observation, you will recall, ended the President's State of the Union 
  address as quoted above. In short, America has at its helm a man who understands 
  his role in God's plan and is determined to carry forward regardless of the 
  views of world leaders or the American people. As Dr. Lower points out in Counterpunch, 
  &quot;Bush's war version of God 'has two dangerous implications' One is that 
  those who have lost their lives in service to God and country (Astronauts) 'weren't 
  actually taking risks or showing bravery because their fate was in God's hands. 
  The other implication is that tragedies are God's will.' This is in the tradition 
  of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell who suggested that the September 11th tragedy 
  happened because God had removed his active protection from an immoral United 
  States.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush is furthered in his drive to 
  Armageddon by those who surround him, both secular zealots intent on ensuring 
  Israel's expansion to the biblical lands given it by the covenant or by the 
  religious right that supports Sharon and controls great Jewish influence in 
  America. Perhaps the most recent evidence of this control on America's mid-east 
  policy comes in the person of Elliott Abrams, the recently appointed director 
  of Mideast Affairs for the National Security Council. Abrams has stated categorically: 
  &quot;The Palestinian leadership does not want peace with Israel, and there 
  will be no peace.&quot; Given his current position, we know the future of American 
  policy in Palestine. Abrams' prophecy of no peace allows the Christian Zionists 
  and the Jewish Zionists to usher in the forces of their perceived good against 
  the forces of their perceived evil, the Muslims. All of which makes possible 
  the scenario prophesied by Hal Lindsey in The Final Battle, making fiction truth 
  and truth fiction.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Christopher Manion</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I asked Cal Thomas a 
  few months ago why so many Christians were so enthusiastic about war with Iraq, 
  if the Pope was so resolutely against it. He answered, &quot;I have no idea.&quot; 
  You can say that again.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Thomas, normally 
  a sensible man writing from an evangelical Christian point of view, has just 
  announced that the biblical &quot;Time for war&quot; is at hand. Invoking Woodrow 
  Wilson, that most peaceable, honest, Christian creature, Thomas explains that 
  &quot;Peace is a byproduct - a benefit - when evil is vanquished.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Thomas is probably 
  the most widely-syndicated Christian columnist in America. So he merits our 
  attention. He is sounding a clarion call to those who regard him as their authority 
  on political questions. He has now told them that evil can be vanquished, that 
  it will only take one little war, and that, when it is over we can have peace. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now Karl Marx believed 
  that, but Jesus Christ didn't...which is another way of saying,&quot;Hogwash!&quot; 
  Since this disputed assumption about the nature of evil and peace constitutes 
  the defective ingredient at the foundation of Mr. Thomas's case, it begs a bit 
  of belaboring. Marx taught that the revolution would end with a version of heaven 
  on earth, but only after the dictatorship of the proletariat, the last stage 
  of history and Marx's materialist counterpart of the Second Coming of Christ 
  and the ensuing establishment of a new heaven and a new earth. For Marx, &quot;peace&quot; 
  would prevail after the emergence of &quot;truly socialist man.&quot;...Evil

  conquered the world.&quot; (John 16:). Please note for the record, that Christ 
  said that he had ALREADY conquered the world, and still warned his followers 
  that they (and we) would have trouble in it. This might prove to be somewhat 
  troubling indeed, to those who were hoping with Mr. Thomas, to enjoy true peace 
  if only we would embark on this one manageable little world war in the Middle 
  East first.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Thomas dismisses 
  that knotty problem, however, with his discovery of two new godlings who redefine 
  evil in a nice, manageable human sort of way, and...rearrange human nature altogether. 
  Embracing their treatise that redefines good and evil, Mr. Thomas announces: 
  &quot;Listen Up, Christians! Evil can be conquered, even without the United 
  Nations.&quot; </font>(Now this is another knotty problem. One that the establishment-liberals 
  will have to face It will still be man against God...Ezekiel 21:27)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It comes as no surprise, 
  alas, that these sources of the new definition of good and evil are Lawrence 
  F. Kaplan and William Kristol. I refer to them as godlings to be consistent 
  with the words of temptation in Genesis. &quot;You shall be as gods, knowing 
  the difference between good and evil.&quot; In their new ordering of good and 
  evil, Mr. Thomas finds sufficient justification...to condemn entire nations, 
  dehumanize millions of people, elevate to semi-divinity those who agree with 
  him, and reject out of hand any rational discourse, all in 800 words...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Mr. Thomas ignores 
  the truth that is staring him in his face: The language he applauds here is 
  clearly non-Christian; in fact, it is Hegelian. Not only does it claim to be 
  a new source of good and evil, it even endows the godlings with the authority 
  to dispense justice, as they...&quot;indict&quot; entire countries, organizations, 
  and even public officials because it appears these barbarians disagree with 
  them. The gnostic conceit is palpable: if you disagree with us, you have &quot;lost 
  your capacity to identify evil and to act against it.&quot; First the verdict, 
  then the trial. We godlings are above it all. Bombs away.</font></p>

  and Dives (Luke 16:20-31): </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>While vacationing on his ranch one August day, George &quot;Dubya&quot; Bush 
    gets thrown from his Segway, lands on a rattlesnake, gets bit and dies (because 
    the emergency room at the nearest hospital is too understaffed to treat him 
    in time). So his soul arrives in heaven and he is met by St.Peter at the Pearly 
    Gates.</p>
  <p>&quot;Welcome to Heaven,&quot; says St. Peter. &quot;Before you settle in, 
    it seems there is a problem: We seldom see a Republican around these parts, 
    so we're not sure what to do with you.&quot; &quot;No problem, just let me 
    in; I'm a believer.&quot; says Dubya.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'd like to just let you in, but I have orders from the Man Himself: 
    He says you have to spend one day in Hell and one day in Heaven. Then you 
    must choose where you'll live for eternity.&quot; &quot;But, I've already 
    made up my mind; I want to be in Heaven,&quot; Dubya protests.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm sorry, but we have our orders.&quot; And with that, St. Peter escorts 
    him to an elevator and he goes down, down, down, all the way to Hell. The 
    doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a lush golf course; the sun 
    is shining in a cloudless sky, the temperature a perfect 72 degrees. In the 
    distance is a beautiful clubhouse. Standing in front of it is his dad...and 
    thousands of other Republicans who had helped him out over the years. . . 
    Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, Jerry Falwell .... The whole of the &quot;Right&quot; 
    is there...everyone laughing ... happy .... casually but expensively dressed. 
    They run to greet him, hug him, and reminisce about the good times they had 
    getting rich at expense of the &quot;suckers and peasants.&quot; They play 
    a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/fatherandson.jpg" width="468" height="337"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Devil himself comes up to Bush with a frosty drink, saying, &quot;Have 
    a Margarita and relax, Dubya!&quot; &quot;Uh, I can't drink no more, I took 
    a pledge,&quot; says Junior, dejectedly. &quot;This is Hell, son: you can 
    drink and eat all you want and not worry, and it just gets better from there!&quot; 
    Dubya takes the drink and finds himself liking the Devil, who he thinks is 
    a really very friendly guy who tells funny jokes and pulls hilarious nasty 
    pranks, kind of like a Yale Skull and Bones brother with real horns. They 
    are having such a great time that, before W realizes it, it's time to go. 
    Everyone gives him a big hug and waves as Bush steps on the elevator and heads 
    upward.</p>
  <p> When the elevator door reopens, he is in Heaven again and St.Peter is waiting 
    for him. &quot;Now it's time to visit Heaven,&quot; the old man says, opening 
    the gate. So for 24 hours Bush is made to hang out with a bunch of honest, 
    good-natured people who enjoy each other's company, talk about things other 
    than money, and treat each other decently. Not a nasty prank or frat boy joke 
    among them; no fancy country clubs and, while the food tastes great, it's 
    not caviar or lobster. And these people are not rich, so he doesn't see anybody 
    he knows, and he isn't even treated like someone special! Worst of all to 
    Dubya, Jesus turns out to be some kind of Jewish hippie with his endless 'peace' 
    and 'do unto others' jive. &quot;Whoa,&quot; he says uncomfortably to himself, 
    &quot;Pat Robertson never prepared me for this!&quot;</p>
  <p>The day done, St. Peter returns and says, &quot;Well, then, you've spent 
    a day in Hell and a day in Heaven. Now choose where you want to live for eternity.&quot; 
    With the 'Jeopardy' theme playing softly in the background, Dubya reflects 
    for a minute, then answers: &quot;Well, I would never have thought I'd say 
    this, but I really think I belong in Hell with my friends.&quot; So Saint 
    Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down, all the way 
    to Hell. The doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren, 
    scorched landscape covered with garbage and toxic industrial waste... kind 
    of like Houston. He is horrified to see all of his friends, dressed in rags 
    and chained together, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. They 
    are groaning and moaning in pain, faces and hands black with grime.</p>
  <p>&quot;I don't understand,&quot; stammers a shocked Dubya. &quot;Yesterday 
    I was here and there was a golf course and a clubhouse and we ate lobster 
    and caviar...drank booze. We screwed around and had a great time. Now there's 
    just a wasteland full of garbage and everybody looks miserable!&quot; The 
    Devil looks at him, smiles slyly, and purrs, &quot;Yesterday we were campaigning. 
    Today, you voted for us.&quot;</p>

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BUSH AND BIN LADEN</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Gene Lyons </font> 
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hypocrisy in a politician is universally 
  held to be a very bad thing, religious hypocrisy worst of all. Alas, to Americans 
  holding post-Enlightenment world-views, it has come down to this: either we 
  must earnestly pray that George W. Bush is a cunning opportunist merely throwing 
  hay to the great lowing herd of pious cattle </font>(please understand Malachi, 
  chapter 4)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> who confuse the evening 
  news with the Book of Revelation, or face the prospect that the United States 
  has embarked upon a faith-based foreign policy as distant from reality as the 
  ranting of Osama bin Laden. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many commentators have noticed that 
  Bush has repeatedly cast the conflict with al Qaeda and Iraq in purely biblical 
  terms--good against evil, &quot;the forces of darkness&quot; against the forces 
  of light, etc. In a speech on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, as Bruce 
  Nolan's article in Sunday's Democrat-Gazette noted, Bush hinted that God was 
  stage-managing the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; for divine purposes. &quot;I 
  believe there is a reason that history has matched this nation with this time,&quot; 
  Bush said. </font>(Which is quite true of course, for reasons that Bush and 
  those who support him can hardly realize)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Bob Woodward's book, 
  &quot;Bush at War&quot; even in one-on-one interviews &quot;[t]he President 
  was casting his mission and that of the country in the grand vision of God's 
  Master Plan.&quot; This observation followed Bush's pronouncement that &quot;WE 
  WILL EXPORT DEATH AND VIOLENCE TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH IN DEFENSE OF 
  THIS GREAT COUNTRY AND RID THE WORLD OF EVIL.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CONQUERING EVIL IS BIN LADEN'S PLAN 
  TOO. Even fighting beside the &quot;socialist infidel&quot; Saddam Hussein, 
  he hinted in a taped statement Feb. 11, was permissible &quot;to establish the 
  rule of God on earth.&quot; Quoting the Koran, he assured his followers that 
  &quot;'those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who reject faith 
  fight in the cause of evil.' So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble 
  indeed is the cunning of Satan.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So have we really been transported 
  back to the 12th century A.D. with Bush as Richard the Lionhearted and Osama/Saddam 
  as Saladin, in a replay of the Third Holy Crusade? We'd better hope not, because 
  although medieval prophets convinced Richard that recapturing Jerusalem from 
  the Muslims would bring about the Second Coming and usher in the millennium, 
  he dragged back to England defeated in 1192. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To bin Laden, who rails against American 
  &quot;crusaders,&quot; this happened the day before yesterday. Bush only plays 
  into his hands with statements like the closing line of his 2003 State of the 
  Union speech contending that &quot;the liberty we prize is not America's gift 
  to the world, it is God's gift to humanity.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To Saddam Hussein, a garden variety 
  criminal psychopath and reportedly a big fan of the &quot;Godfather&quot; movies, 
  it's unlikely this signifies much. As grandiose as Stalin, Saddam gives no sign 
  of confusing himself with the deity. The origins of Bush's flirtation with End 
  Times rhetoric, however, are no more remote than the New York Times Best Seller 
  List, specifically the prophetic novels of Hal Lindsey (&quot;Blood Moon&quot;) 
  and Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins' &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. Selling in 
  the millions, these books are a florid updating of a 19th century school of 
  bible-based soothsaying called &quot;premillenial dispensationalism.&quot; Radio 
  and TV evangelists, including the ubiquitous Jerry Falwell peddle this gibberish 
  to millions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adepts believe, writes historian 
  Paul S. Boyer, that a series of last day signs including &quot;wars, natural 
  disasters, rampant immorality, the rise of a world political and economic order, 
  and the return of the Jews to the land promised by God to Abraham&quot; will 
  signal the Rapture. True Believers will be magically whisked off to heaven, 
  the Antichrist will seize world power--through the United Nations, naturally--thus 
  ushering in the Second Coming, Armageddon and the Millenium. Ironically, the 
  incomprehensible imagery in Revelation was borrowed from Babylonian (Iraqi) 
  and Zoroastrian (Iranian) myth in the first place. Bush's flirtation with End 
  Times rhetoric makes some suspect that he actually perceives himself as God's 
  instrument. Many Europeans fear they're trapped <br>
  between rival fundamentalist zealots whose messianic delusions threaten World 
  War III. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Call me na&iuml;ve, but I hold with 
  hypocrisy. Everything known about Bush apart from his political rhetoric suggests 
  belief in a conventional rich man's God. His idea of paradise is a country club 
  golf course. His public religiosity is precisely calculated to enthrall fundamentalist 
  Christians whose failure to turn out in 1992 led to his father's defeat--the 
  only Armageddon Junior seriously anticipates. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Protocols -- A 
  NeoCon Manifesto<br>
  By Simon Jones </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have to confess. The 
  outrageous in-your-face behavior of the neocons finally got to me - as Armageddon 
  approaches, after seeing more and more references to it (albeit usually wacky), 
  I recently downloaded the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Guiltily, mind you, 
  as if it were Mein Kampf or porno. I bet you haven't dared (or bothered) to 
  read it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, what is this best-selling political 
  tract of the 20th century, the reading of which carried the death penalty in 
  Stalinist Russia, lauded by the likes of Henry Ford and Winston Churchill, and 
  then loudly condemned for the past 60 years since it was briefly declared an 
  anti-Semitic forgery (in a Swiss court in 1935 overturned by the Appeals Court 
  in 1937)? The bile aside, it is in fact an series of 24 mostly articulate, well-argued 
  lectures outlining a plan for world capitalist domination, with sharp political 
  and social analysis, lots of Machiavelli and a Marxian sophistication in its 
  understanding of capitalism and historical processes. Briefly, it outlines a 
  plan of world conquest by first establishing world government by consent. As 
  with any brilliant political analysis, it has been denounced, dismissed, misinterpreted 
  and banned. And made very good use of by those lusting for world power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What immediately struck me was that 
  with a little dusting off, abridging and updating, it could easily be the handbook 
  of the neocons. With the wonders of modern computers, you can download a free 
  copy from the Internet, cleanse it of anti-Semitism by replacing &quot;fellow 
  Jews&quot; with &quot;neocons&quot; and make sense of what's happening in the 
  world today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mysterious origins? Not really</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though its origins are still unknown, 
  it was clearly inspired by the French revolution and its aftermath, the then-popular 
  Masonic order, and most of all the nascent 19th century Zionist movement. All 
  that we know is that it was written in France and brought to Russia, supposedly 
  in 1884. It first appeared in print in St Petersburg in 1903, but reached the 
  West only after the Russian revolution. It caused an immediate sensation, originally 
  crudely interpreted as foretelling the Bolshevik revolution as the crucial link 
  in a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. As such, it was admired by the likes 
  of Churchill and Ford, both confirmed anti-communists and anti-Semites.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True, it has the prescience to allow 
  for an anti-capitalist revolution on the way to its final goal, but there's 
  nothing even vaguely socialist in it. It's firmly founded on a plan for capitalist 
  domination through Jewish control of international finance and just happened 
  to appear at the very moment of the founding of the Zionist movement, with its 
  goal of establishing as soon as possible a Jewish state in Palestine, backed 
  by powerful worldwide Ashkenazy Jewish economic interests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's as if an especially ruthless 
  and well-read 19th c Zionist, inspired by the Rothschilds and other great Jewish 
  financiers of the time, wrote it or most of it, as I am sure is the case. Really, 
  it reads as if it were written by the Jungian shadow of the likes of Zionism's 
  founder, Theodore Herzl, or any of Israel's notables from Ben Gurion to Ariel 
  Sharon. Its anti-goyim callousness certainly indicate it was not written for 
  public consumption, and after Hitler, it was relegated to the Forbidden Shelf 
  in ALL libraries along with Mein Kampf and naked bottoms. But it is very hard 
  to believe that it is a spoof or a mere provocation, as it is just too impressive 
  in detail and understanding of the logic of late 19th century capitalism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Did Hitler read it? I bet the Nazis 
  read it carefully. They certainly followed much of its advice, from how to use 
  the press, to how to manipulate both politicians and the masses in consolidating 
  their political hold. It's also clear why destruction of the Jews became Hitler's 
  tragic obsession. His New World Order (NWO) would have to exclude a group even 
  remotely connected with such a scheme for world domination. As the neocons warn 
  today: &quot;You are either with us or against us.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many paths - but they all lead to 
  Rome (That is, America).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trouble with the Protocols is 
  that it has been interpreted since it was published to suit the prejudices of 
  the moment. In pre-revolutionary Russia, it provided fuel for the already widespread 
  Russian anti-Semitism. In post-WWI Europe and America, it provided fuel against 
  the Russian revolution. In the post-WWII world, it became the Bible of American 
  isolationists and racists who see the poor UN as the dreaded &quot;World Government,&quot; 
  backed by the Soviet Union and 3rd world revolutions. Now it is read by Muslims 
  as proof of the conspiracy by US imperialism to destroy them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another problem is that there have 
  been many variations on the theme of the NWO ever since the collapse of the 
  Roman Empire. The French revolution and Napoleonic conquests, the Masonic lodges, 
  imperial Germany and England all have had their own NWO fantasy. The Russian 
  revolution was the most radical attempt at a NWO, and even can be distinguished 
  for the large number of Jews who took part, but despite the fact that the Protocols 
  was first published in Russia and strictly banned during the Soviet period, 
  the Soviet experiment was not even remotely the final World Government of the 
  Protocols, as it was anti-capitalist in its essence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The red herring in it is of course 
  'Jewish', which is supposed to refer to a race. The Jews referred to in the 
  Protocols are the European Ashkenazy Jews, who had been traditionally usurers 
  and who were in the 19th century becoming increasing wealthy and part of the 
  mainstream European culture. From them sprang the Zionists, who transformed 
  a religion where God is to bring them to the 'promised land' someday into an 
  active plan to seize Palestine based on their growing international economic 
  and financial might. So it is this group that is the real inspiration behind 
  the Protocols and not some amorphous Jewish RACE. Think of the authors as the 
  neocons of the day. For by the 19th century, usury was the norm, and the rapid 
  spread of capitalism meant that the Western world effectively became Jewish, 
  as Marx put it, and adopted the Jewish idea of success.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet another problem. It is loudly 
  dismissed as a forgery. Hello? It was anonymous, so how can it be a forgery. 
  Who forged what? No wonder the Swiss Appeals Court threw the case out. In that 
  case we can dismiss the Bible as a forgery. And who cares who wrote the Psalms 
  anyway? They stand on their own merits, as does the Protocols stripped of a 
  few provocative phrases here and there, which could have been slipped in by 
  anyone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may well protest: &quot;The Protocols 
  attributes the conscious machinations of Jews to be behind all historical developments. 
  I don't believe the Zionists are either so powerful, or so far-sighted.&quot; 
  In answer: It's not necessary for our actions to be premeditated. The logic 
  of world capitalism sweeps us along, whether we like it or not. Some players 
  are more conscious (and ruthless) than others. They become the Herzls, the Wolfowitzes, 
  the Sharons. The rest of us get swept along, either yielding to, or fighting 
  the current: the Bushes and the Schwartzeneggers or the goyim. The Protocols 
  (or its original, if it is indeed a forgery) was inspired by the new economic 
  system sweeping the world, and composed by the 19th century equivalent of the 
  neocons. It hasn't played itself out yet, just as capitalism hasn't played itself 
  out. We ignore it at our peril.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Arise, ye prisoners of starvation?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Contrast the Zionist movement with 
  the other great attempt at a NWO from the 19th century on -- the world socialist 
  movement. It is far weaker, split by nationalism and hundreds of ideological 
  splinters, and motivated by social justice, a far less competitive motivation 
  that money, wealth and power-for-its-own-sake. The Protocols is quite clear 
  about this: &quot;Our triumph has been rendered easier by the fact that in our 
  relations with the men whom we wanted we have always worked upon the most sensitive 
  chords of the human mind, upon the cash account, upon the cupidity, upon the 
  insatiability for material needs of man: and each one of these human weaknesses, 
  taken alone, is sufficient to paralyze initiative, for it hands over the will 
  of men to the disposition of him who has bought their activities.&quot; (I)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no fear of the dangerous 
  effective of democracy: &quot;The abstraction of freedom has enabled us to persuade 
  the mob in all countries that their government is nothing but the steward of 
  the people who are the owners of the country, and that the steward may be replaced 
  like a worn-out glove. It is this possibility of replacing the representatives 
  of the people which has placed them at our disposal, and, as it were, given 
  us the power of appointment.&quot; (I)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Socialism never had a chance against 
  this corrosive Machiavellianism, though, just in case, the Protocols had a plan: 
  &quot;The hour strikes when, not for the sake of attaining the good, not even 
  to win wealth, but solely out of hatred towards the privileged, the lower classes 
  of the goyim will follow our lead against our rivals for power, the intellectuals 
  of the goyim.&quot; (IV) This is the only reference to the use of a revolt of 
  the masses, which was seized upon to associate the Protocols with the Russian 
  revolution. Rather slim pickings, and it reveals the strategy is to undermine 
  the &quot;intellectuals of the goyim&quot;, i.e., the socialist opposition to 
  world capitalism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the contrary, the Russian revolution 
  seemed to really shake the very foundations of the plan for world capitalist 
  domination. Curiously in its first 30 years the SU had the Zionists split. Why? 
  Well, no doubt partly because many rank-and-file Zionists were socialist by 
  persuasion, truly wanted the SU to succeed and hoped for a socialist Israel 
  as a bonus (Herzl's utopian novel depicts a socialist Israel). But for the Zionist 
  fanatics of the Protocols, their fence-sitting was because achieving their own 
  state was the main priority, and required the support of both the communist 
  and capitalist camps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And as for the softer versions of 
  socialism which have surfaced occasionally in the West, their headway has always 
  been kept well in check, and social democratic reforms were rolled back very 
  easily after the collapse of the SU, via the tactics envisaged in the Protocols. 
  So the plan of the Protocols should not be confused with the many variations 
  on a socialist/ communist NWO.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you can't beat 'em, join 'em</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Protocols also lauds &quot;the 
  successes we arranged for Darwinism, Marxism, Nietzscheism.&quot; (II) Why promote 
  such radicals? Because of the &quot;disintegrating importance these directives 
  have had upon the minds of the goyim.&quot; Just how central to Marx's success 
  these Zionists were is debatable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But it's become clear to me that 
  Zionists have penetrated and tried to control all the NWO fantasies, from left 
  to right, to further their own cause. It is not surprise then that they have 
  been at the center of the present neocon insurgency from the start. And as for 
  the EU-as-NWO, Sharon even suggested Israel should join the EU since 'we share 
  common ideals'. In spite of Israel's loathing for the UN, it is at the very 
  heart of THAT beleaguered, clumsy organization too (with a stake in hand just 
  in case, it can be argued). It has recently been revealed that Zionists are 
  even involved with extreme right anti-Semitic movements in Europe and with the 
  creation of Hamas. After all, anti-Semitism is the Zionist's best defense. &quot;The 
  Jewish group has thrived on oppression and on the antagonism it has forever 
  met in the world.&quot; (Albert Einstein, Collier's Magazine, November 26, 1938)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True, anti-Semitism got out of control 
  under Hitler and it even looked like it was touch-and-go for a while for the 
  Ashkenazy Jews of Europe, but fascism was in turn destroyed by a capitalist-communist 
  alliance, with Zionists at its heart, as the Protocols so brilliantly foretold: 
  &quot;For a time perhaps we might be successfully dealt with by a coalition 
  of the goyim of all the world: but from this danger we are secured by the discord 
  existing among them whose roots are so deeply seated that they can never now 
  be plucked up.&quot; (VI) Divide and rule!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Holocaust gave the fanatical 
  Zionists their long-sought state, which allowed them to discard any socialist 
  pretensions and nurture the capitalist-Zionist alliance essential to the goal 
  of world domination. The defining moment is perhaps the triumph of the neocons 
  under Reagan in the 1980s. The Zionists had consolidated their hold on American 
  foreign policy under Democrat Carter, and were ready to make the alliance official 
  under Republican Reagan. It is at this point that the very term Zionist and 
  even Jew can be discarded. As I have argued elsewhere, 'We are all Jews now.' 
  (http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Articles4/Jones_Palestine.htm) And with the Bush 
  coup in 2000, we all (for the present at least) have become neocons (or goyim). 
  As the opposition grows weaker, with the shield of the Holocaust at the ready, 
  the neocon-Zionist alliance has begun to act more and more brazenly to consolidate 
  its hold on the world and destroy the last meaningful resistance - the Islamic 
  world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ultimate trump card</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only was the Holocaust and the 
  way to defeat it foreseen in the Protocols, but, like the anti-Semitism that 
  gave rise to it, it has been turned into the ultimate defense of the Zionist 
  cause. A kind of perverse win-win situation for the Zionists. It transformed 
  important anti-Semites into Judeophiles overnight. While Churchill was an enthusiastic 
  reader of the Protocols before WWII, he became an enthusiastic supporter of 
  the foundation of Israel after, and shifted his anti-Semitism onto the Arabs. 
  Stalin, also a confirmed anti-Semite, provided the key vote at the UN to approve 
  the foundation of Israel and supplied crucial arms via Czechoslovakia to the 
  beleaguered state, foolishly thinking he could ultimately manipulate. Ha, ha! 
  Finally it became the linchpin in consolidating today's neocon-Zionist alliance, 
  and a brilliant defense for all manner of Zionist crimes: &quot;We can do anything 
  to defend ourselves after the Holocaust!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The icing on the cake is the impressive 
  Holocaust museum which blends in tastefully with the Lincoln and Washington 
  memorials in the heart of Washington, D.C. (Note: There is no museum to the 
  Holocaust against the native peoples or the blacks.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A crack in the wall?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 'Old Europe' has made some 
  noises about this lethal NWO, the governments are nonetheless beholden to it, 
  and can do little but try to carve a slightly bigger piece of the pie. No, the 
  only meaningful remaining resistance to the neocon-Zionist NWO is the as yet 
  unbrainwashed goyim of the world - the peace movement and the Islamic world, 
  strange bedfellows at best. However, there are some disturbing ripples in the 
  NWO waters. Bush/ Sharon have chosen the warpath, while the Soros branch, which 
  includes Europe, wants a more peaceful transition. The reckless policies of 
  the erstwhile &quot;servile administrator&quot; in Washington are quite possibly 
  endangering the very economic foundation of the NWO. The Protocols foresees 
  such chaos, though it presumes to be in control of it: &quot;We shall soon begin 
  to establish huge monopolies, reservoirs of colossal riches, upon which even 
  large fortunes of the GOYIM will depend to such an extent that they will go 
  to the bottom together with the credit of the States on the day after the political 
  smash....&quot; (VI)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such a collapse of the present world 
  financial system is not at all beyond the realm of possibility. And if it comes, 
  it could take down the US government and the neocons with it. It is here that 
  the PROTOCOLS begins to unravel. The Protocols assumes the corporate financial 
  cabal controlling the world economy will be invited to take over bankrupt governments 
  with their World Government, as indeed has been happening under the guise of 
  IMF restructuring programs and more recently by direct invasion. But the bankrupt 
  and invaded countries, such as Argentina, most of Africa, Afghanistan, Iraq 
  for starters are proving to be problematic, more than the cabal can digest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maybe, just maybe, the neocons' gamble 
  will trip them up before they reach the finish line and they will end up along 
  side the despised GOYIM at the bottom. A switch to a gold dinar in the Muslim 
  world and oil-euros for the rest would seriously endanger the NWO, as would 
  a massive ecological disaster, natural or man-made. The mild neocons (Soros 
  etal) see this clearly and are scurrying to minimize collateral damage. Theirs 
  is a strategy closer to the spirit of the Protocols - no overt wars, a careful 
  amassing of power through education and the control of the press, no dangerous 
  splits in the capitalist-Zionist alliance, achieving victory through financial 
  and trade blackmail. Have a look at the Protocols yourself. It's all there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, are these cowboy jackboot high 
  jinks a momentary glitch in the triumphal march to the neocon-Zionist paradise? 
  Will a Howard Dean, urged on by Soros, put the out-of-control steamroller back 
  on its proper path? Or has the Protocols played itself out? Is our present apocalyptic 
  scenario instead a crack that gives us hope of emerging from this nightmarish 
  plot?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rational racism?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't know about the Elders, the 
  Symbolic Snake, the actual killing off of the goyim, whether the line of King 
  David will be re-established to rule the world, the importance of the Masons, 
  or whether the French Revolution &quot;was wholly the work of our hands&quot;. 
  There's surprisingly little of such bile for a work of such notoriety, and it 
  can be easily edited out so as not to distract from the sharp analysis. Perhaps 
  it was added by an anti-Semite as a provocation. Who knows? As for the Masons, 
  come to think of it, the popularity of them, the Yale Skull and Bones, and other 
  such Monty-Pythonesque groups shows a stubborn inclination by would-be GOYIM 
  leaders to voluntarily (i.e., consciously or unconsciously) make themselves 
  part of a world conspiracy, however idiotic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's not so much the problem. The 
  major flaw behind the logic of the Protocols is its basic premise - that there 
  is a Jewish race. There is only one race, the human race. Just have a look at 
  Israeli society if you think there is a racial basis to Judaism. But hey! Scientists 
  are discovering that there are genes which are responsible for skin color, that 
  define risk-takers or those susceptible to various diseases Maybe there's a 
  gene for these would-be Elders of Zion. Perhaps the NY Times will post the following 
  soon: The Zionist-neocons now welcome to their fold those who share their lust 
  for capitalist world domination. All those with gene DN145, please sign up here. 
  We are all equal before Mammon. MBA schools will go crazy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Masonic lodges, Skull and Bones 
  fraternities, the Jewish 'race' itself are just foils in this march of world 
  capitalism, gathering in like-minded wanabes as it makes its final push for 
  total control. It is somehow fitting that the once reviled Jew should sit one 
  day on the world's golden throne surrounded by his neocon minions. That is the 
  Protocols' vision of the end of history. Eat your heart out Fukuyama!</font></p>

    <b>THE AMERICAN RELIGION</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Emergence of the Post-Christian 
    Nation </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Harold Bloom</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">INVOCATION: THE EVENING 
    LAND</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Freedom, in the context 
    of the American Religion, means being alone with God or with Jesus, the American 
    God or the American Christ. In social reality, this translates as solitude, 
    at least in the inmost sense. The soul stands apart, and something deeper 
    than the soul, the Real Me or self or spark, thus is made free to be utterly 
    alone with a God who is also quite separate and solitary, that is, a free 
    God or God of freedom. What makes it possible for the self and God to commune 
    so freely is that the self already is of God; unlike the body and even soul, 
    the American self is no part of the Creation, or of evolution through the 
    ages. The American self is not the Adam of Genesis but is a more primordial 
    Adam, a Man before there were men or woman. Higher and earlier than the angels, 
    this true Adam is as old as God, older than the Bible, and is free of time, 
    unstained by mortality. Whatever the social and political consequences of 
    this vision, its imaginative strength is extraordinary....</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our war against Iraq, 
    just completed, was a true religious war...It was the war of the American 
    Religion (and of the American Religion abroad, even among our Arab allies) 
    against whatever denies the self's status and function as the true standard 
    of being and of value. Democracy is not at issue here, and even private property 
    is not at the center. President George Bush, generally not considered overdevout, 
    followed President Reagan and other precursors (Nixon, Ford, Carter) by summoning 
    Billy Graham as an emblem of the American Religion. Appearing, Bible perpetually 
    in hand, at the President's side, Graham implicitly certified the war as having 
    biblical sanction. (pp.15-17).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CANE RIDGE THROUGH 
    BILLY GRAHAM</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What this book terms 
    the American Religion will not end until the nation ends, and yet did not 
    come into full existence for nearly a generation after the nation began. I 
    remember, in the summer of 1969, brooding on the Woodstock rock festival, 
    and finding in it many of the stigmata of the great camp meeting of American 
    revival tradition. The first Woodstock, and the most extraordinary camp meeting 
    ever, took place at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, starting on August 6, 1801, and 
    going on for a week afterwards. Perhaps as many as twenty-five thousand experienced 
    the ecstasies of Cane Ridge...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The backwoodsmen and 
    their families, like the young Americans at Woodstock, underwent a singular 
    experience of blending into Orphic unison, in which denominational differences 
    dissolved. Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists at once became American Religionists, 
    rapt by ecstasy. Barton Stone, then a Presbyterian minister, came out of Cane 
    Ridge as an incipient Restorationist, searching again for the Primitive Church...Most 
    simply, the American Jesus was born at Cane Ridge, and is with us still, in 
    Nashville and Salt Lake City </font>(Bloom takes the Mormon story in another 
    esoteric, kabbalistic direction, contrasts and compares it to the Roman Catholic, 
    Islamic, and Southern Baptist religions, and then skillfully blends it back 
    to the same great American state of mind)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    in New Orleans and in East Harlem storefronts. He is the Jesus who barely 
    was crucified, and whose Forty days of Resurrection upon earth never have 
    ended. Or if he ascended, he has come back and keeps coming back in the pouring 
    out of Spirit. He cannot be known in or through a church, but only one on 
    one, and then indeed he is known, with far more immediacy evidently than even 
    heightened sexual experience can provide, more even than frontier violence 
    can provide. AMERICAN REVIVALISM, WITH ITS ENDLESS GREAT AWAKENINGS, IS AS 
    RECURRENT A PHENOMENON AS AMERICAN VIOLENCE. We don't have crime waves any 
    more than we have Great Awakenings; VIOLENT CRIME AND RELIGIOUS REVIVALISM 
    ARE CONSTANT THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY </font>(understand Ephesians 6:10-12)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...both 
    conceal the troubling near identity between the religion of violence and the 
    violence of religion. CANE RIDGE SET THE PATTERN OF ADDICTION IN WHICH AMERICANS 
    BEAR AWAY THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN BY VIOLENCE. (pp.59-64).</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SOUTHERN BAPTISTS</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The crushing of the 
    Confederacy by superior force led to a trauma in the Southern Baptist spirit, 
    evidently a more severe aftershock than the other Southern denominations experienced. 
    PRECISELY WHY THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO IS RATHER A MYSTERY, AND I HAVE FOUND 
    NO PERSUASIVE EXPLANATION FOR IT...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I would hazard again the suggestion 
  that Baptists were unique in having no founder, no overwhelming visionary and 
  leader in their past. (They had rejected the voice and reasonings of Roger Williams). 
  The Southern Presbyterians had Calvin, the Southern Methodists had Wesley, but 
  the Southern Baptists had found their heroic figures in the great generals of 
  the Confederacy, in Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, neither of whom were 
  Baptists but both of whom assumed a kind of angelic status. A vehement nostalgia 
  was combined with a rejection of subsequent history, so that nearly every new 
  idea of the last third of the nineteenth century came to be rejected by Southern 
  Baptists, with the unhappy consequence that no other American denomination entered 
  the twentieth century with so pervasive an investment in anti-intellectualism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That investment has overdetermined 
  the nature of the Fundamentalists in the Southern Baptist Convention, and has 
  led to the current, more-than-justified despair of the Moderates. THE CRUSADE 
  OF THE TEXAS FUNDAMENTALISTS HAS TURNED INTO A DRIVE AGAINST THOUGHT ITSELF, 
  IN A FINAL REVENGE UPON HISTORY FOR THE REFUSAL OF GOD TO GIVE VICTORY TO THE 
  SOUTH...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>What then was the Great Southern Baptist Myth? The denomination of the 
    defeated, itself born of schism and racism, had become God's &quot;last&quot; 
    and &quot;only hope&quot; for evangelizing the world according to New Testament 
    principles. Its numerical, financial, and spiritual growth, as well as its 
    evangelistic zeal, was evidence of God's blessing on its ministry, its mission, 
    and its method...Nothing could be allowed to deter the South's most southern 
    denomination from its calling TO REDEEM ITSELF AND WIN THE ULTIMATE BATTLE 
    AGAINST EVIL. This passion for Triumph, for spiritual and numerical success 
    among Southern Baptists, cannot be understood apart from the surrender at 
    Appomattox. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(God's Last and 
    Only Hope, by Bill J. Leonard, p.13).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But there have been many negative 
  instances of Baptist triumphalism in between...and had produced the rather dreadful 
  Hard-Shell Baptists, headed by a peculiar Gnostic, Daniel Parker, who brought 
  many of the Hard-Shellers together under the dominion of his &quot;TWO-SEED-IN-THE-SPIRIT&quot; 
  ideology. This doctrine, an extraordinary throwback to second-century Sethian 
  Gnosticism (about which Parker knew absolutely nothing), amounted to a savage 
  predeterminarianism. God had implanted one seed in Eve, and Satan another in 
  the unfortunate mother of mankind. The good seed, the ancient Gnostics would 
  have said, resulted in Seth, who replaced poor Abel, while the bad gave us Cain 
  </font>(the tiller of the soil)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Since 
  everyone is the product of one or the other seed, effort or missionary work 
  is irrelevant; one is seeded either elect or damned. (pp.197,198)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ENIGMA</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How does the authentic (read Moderate) 
  Southern Baptist reconcile a fanatical emphasis upon the absolute necessity 
  for a personal, experiential encounter of conversion with the resurrected Jesus 
  with a total devotion to Scripture? Both these terms are experiential, and so 
  they are not dialectical. </font>(But yes they are)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.

    29:11; 1 Peter 1:3-5).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have said this earlier, but place 
  it now at the center of the Southern Baptist enigma. The experience in each 
  mode is purely inward; you talk to Jesus, you sense him, you receive emotional 
  assurance, but unlike Joseph Smith you do not see Jesus or hear the sound of 
  his voice. And yet you are saved, once and for all; you receive certainty. Even 
  the Mormons did not outdo (the Baptists) in the assurance of freedom, AND IN 
  THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE ACHIEVED IMAGE OF GOD TO THE ARENA OF AMERICA...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George Bush, in his post-Gulf War 
  victory speech to the Southern Baptist Convention, did not exactly promise to 
  make the world safe for (the American Religion) but as an Episcopalian he presumably 
  was not any more versed in the (meaning of things) than were his triumphantalists 
  Fundamentalist hosts...The profound point is again what (Baptists) so strangely 
  share with the prophet Joseph Smith, and what neither share with the mainline 
  Reformed churches. Call it man-godhood, or theomorphism, or what you will, but 
  both (Baptists) and (Mormons) exalted in the image of the human. Baptist freedom, 
  like the freedom of the Mormons' Restored Gospel, is the freedom to come very 
  close to the divinity as well as the manhood of Jesus...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Moderate Southern Baptist, in 
  what is taken (rightly or wrongly) as an imitation of Saul of Tarsus on the 
  Damascus road, presses for his or her soul's encounter with Jesus...No Southern 
  Baptist, of any camp, will believe me when I tell them that they are subject 
  and object of their own quest. This most aggressive of Protestantisms is no 
  Protestantism at all, BUT A PURE OUTFLARING AGAIN OF THE ANCIENT GNOSIS. The 
  Jesus who is sought is already both principle and particle in the soul that 
  seeks him. Nothing that I have perceived of the American Religion is more persuasive 
  THAN THE IMAGE OF THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST ALONE IN THE GARDEN WITH JESUS. (pp.216,217).</font></p>
