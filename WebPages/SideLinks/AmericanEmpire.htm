<p><b>AMERICAN EMPIRE</b></p>
  <p><b>By Ivo Daalder and James M. Lindsay</b></p>

<p><b><br>
  he 100,000 American troops patrolling Baghdad and other Iraqi cities retain 
  &quot;absolute authority within Iraq,&quot; declared their commander, Lt. Gen. 
  David McKiernan. At the same time, AMERICAN FORCES ARE BEING DEPLOYED IN A GRAND 
  CRESCENT SURROUNDING THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST, FROM THE BALKANS SOUTHEST TO DIJIBOUTI, 
  EAST THROUGH THE PERSIAND GULF REGION INTO PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN, AND NORTH 
  INTO UZBEKISTAN AND KRYGYZTAN.</b></p>

<p><b>Little wonder that commentators at home and abroad continually speak of 
  a new American empire. In the last six months alone, as debate on Iraq peaked, 
  the phrase &quot;American empire&quot; was mentioned nearly 1,000 times in news 
  stories, while bookstores have been quickly filling their shelves with freshly 
  minted tomes on the subject.</b></p>
<p><b>On one side are those who urge Washington to reject the imperial temptation. 
  These voices can be found on both the far right and the far left. Pat Buchanan, 
  author of &quot;Republic or Empire?&quot; and editor of the new American Conservative 
  Weekly, is concerned that the &quot;conservative movement has been hijacked 
  and turned into a globalist, interventionist, open borders ideology,&quot; which, 
  he says, is a far cry from the conservative movement he grew up with. Noam Chomsky, 
  whose &quot;Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Domination&quot; 
  is scheduled for publication in the fall, warns that the BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S 
  &quot;FORTHRIGHT DECLARATION THAT IT INTENDS TO RULE THE WORLD BY FORCE&quot;amounts 
  to fanaticism.</b></p>
<p><b>On the other side are the so-called neoconservatives, who sayTHE UNITED 
  STATES HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMAKE THE WORLD IN ITS OWN IMAGE. The syndicated 
  columnist Charles Krauthammer, for example, says American foreign policy should 
  seek to transform the unipolar moment of the 1990's into &quot;the unipolar 
  era.&quot; William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, 
  told Fox News recently: &quot;WE NEED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF BEING STRONG. And 
  if people want to say we're an imperial power, fine.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>Some commentators go even further, arguing that the problem is not too much 
  American imperialism but too little. In their eyes, Afghanistan taught that 
  failed and failing states threaten American security by providing safe havens 
  for terrorists, drug traffickers, transnational criminal networks and other 
  no-goodniks. &quot;Given the historical baggage that `imperialism' carries, 
  there's no need for the U.S. government to embrace the term,&quot; Max Boot, 
  author of &quot;These Savage Wars of Peace&quot; (Basic Books), wrote this week 
  in USA Today. &quot;But it should definitely embrace the practice.&quot; In 
  Iraq this &quot;means imposing the rule of law, property rights and other guarantees, 
  at gunpoint if need be.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>The British historian Niall Ferguson makes a similar argument for an imperial 
  America in his new book, &quot;Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World 
  Order and the Lessons for Global Power.&quot; The Bush administration and its 
  supporters, not surprisingly, recoil at any suggestion that their foreign policy 
  is or should be imperial. &quot;The metaphor is seductive yet vicious,&quot; 
  complains Philip Zelikow, director of the University of Virginia's Miller Center 
  of Public Affairs and someone who helped draft the administration's national 
  security strategy, which was articulated last September.</b></p>
<p><b>President Bush has been less direct but no less definitive. In a speech 
  to the American Enterprise Institute in February, he committed the United States 
  to rebuilding Iraq after the war. &quot;America has made and kept this kind 
  of commitment before &#151; in the peace that followed a world war. After defeating 
  enemies, we did not leave behind occupying armies, we left constitutions and 
  parliaments.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>Yet for all the debate over whether or not the United States should be an 
  empire, that question is beside the point. Like it or not, the power and reach 
  of the United States have already turned it into an empire. Indeed, it has been 
  one in some form or another for more than 100 years, ever since the United States 
  triumphed in the Spanish-American War and American troops occupied Cuba, Puerto 
  Rico and the Philippines...</b></p>

<p><b>...And the American imperium did not stop there. In 1903 Teddy Roosevelt 
  engineered Panama's rebellion against Colombia. The next year he asserted the 
  Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. Washington not only had the right 
  to keep European powers out of the Western Hemisphere, it also had the right 
  to exercise &quot;an international police power&quot; against any country in 
  the Americas engaged in &quot;chronic wrongdoing.&quot; Over the next three 
  decades, the Marines conducted long occupations of the Dominican Republic, Haiti 
  and Nicaragua while fulfilling Roosevelt's charge to restore &quot;the ties 
  of civilized society.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>THE UNITED STATES DID GO MARCHING HOME AGAIN AFTER WORLD WAR I. BUT IT DIDN'T 
  AFTER WORLD WAR II. INSTEAD WASHINGTON BUILT A WEB OF PERMANENTLY ENTANGLING 
  ALLIANCES THAT STRETCHED AROUND THE GLOBE. AT ONE POINT THE UNITED STATES HAD 
  MILITARY BASES IN MORE THAN 70 COUNTRIES.</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art taken, O Babylon 
    (America), and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because 
    thou hast striven against the Lord...(Jeremiah 50:24; Revelation 18...KJV).</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>TODAY NO OTHER COUNTRY CAN BEGIN TO MATCH THE REACH AND LETHALITY OF THE 
  AMERICAN ARMED FORCES. Only the United States can send bombers from its heartland 
  on a round-trip mission to attack targets anywhere around the globe and do so 
  with great stealth, precision and destructive force. Only the United States 
  can quickly dispatch ground forces in large numbers to any battlefield in the 
  world and defeat any traditional foe. Only the United States can deploy a truly 
  blue-water navy across every ocean, with 12 mammoth aircraft carriers each housing 
  a modern air armada larger than the entire air force of most countries.</b></p>
<p><b>There is no doubt that the United States can afford this vast military might. 
  The American economy accounts for 31 percent of the world's total output, as 
  much as it did in the 1950's. It is larger than that of the four next-largest 
  national economies (Japan, Germany, France and Britain) combined, and it accounts 
  for almost half the gross domestic product of the G-7 countries (which also 
  include Canada and Italy). At the same time, military spending consumes a smaller 
  share of the American gross domestic product today than it did a decade ago, 
  and only about half of what it did during the height of the cold war. &quot;Being 
  No. 1 at great cost is one thing,&quot; the Yale University historian Paul Kennedy 
  marvels. &quot;BEING THE WORLD'S SINGLE SUPERPOWER on the cheap is astonishing.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>The real debate, then, is not whether to have an empire, but what kind. 
  Should America pursue a go-it-alone strategy as it did in 1910, when the United 
  States exerted its power largely at the point of the bayonet and ignored the 
  views of others? Or should it be the empire of 1950, when Washington embedded 
  American power in multilateral institutions that reflected American interests 
  but also constrained its freedom of action?</b></p>
<p><b>This question was the crux of the dispute with the United Nations over whether 
  to invade Iraq and the one preoccupying the world now as the reconstruction 
  begins. President Bush has made it clear since Sept. 11 that he intends to lead, 
  and other countries can follow or get out of the way. HE AND HIS SUPPORTERS 
  SAY THE UNITED STATES EMBODIES A UNIQUE BLEND OF MIGHT AND RIGHT THAT CAN DELIVER 
  A WORLD OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY FOR ALL. To forsake that opportunity in a fit 
  of self-doubt or excessive modesty, they say, will only make Americans and all 
  other peoples less secure.</b></p>
<p><b>Critics, by contrast, favor an empire built on international cooperation, 
  alliances and law. They argue that is the only way to reassure countries fearful 
  of American dominance AND KEEP THEM FROM USING THEIR diplomatic and ECONOMIC 
  POWER TO CONTAIN THE UNITED STATES.</b></p>
<p><b>As the Iraq war underscored, the United States' great power enables it to 
  act alone and still achieve many of its goals swiftly and effectively. But over 
  time such a unilateral exercise of power will breed more and more resentment 
  abroad to the point that other states may decide to work together to obstruct 
  the chosen American course. THEN, THE UNITED STATES COULD STAND ALONE, A GREAT 
  POWER FRUSTRATED IN THE PURSUIT OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT GOALS.</b></p>

    <p align="center"><b>And their horsemen (their warriors) shall spread themselves...and 
      shall come from afar; they shall fly as the Eagle that hasteth to eat...(Habakkuk, 
      chapter 1; Acts 13:40,41...KJV)</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>In a new six-part series entitled Age of Empire, the BBC's 
  Jonathan Marcus sets out on a journey to examine America's place in the modern 
  world.</b></p>
<p align="left"> <b>&quot;America has no empire to extend or utopia to establish. 
  We wish for others only what we wish for ourselves - safety from violence, the 
  rewards of liberty, and the hope for a better life.&quot; So declared President 
  George Bush in the traditional graduation address at the US Military academy 
  at West Point in June 2002. </b></p>
<p><b>But despite his insistence that the US has no imperial ambitions, the word 
  &quot;empire&quot; is increasingly used by academics and pundits alike when 
  talking about America's role in the world. We thought long and hard about the 
  title for this series. Would Age of Empire prejudge the issue? Is America really 
  in any sense an empire like Ancient Rome or Victorian Britain? It is a question 
  I put to virtually everyone I spoke to. The answers differed dramatically. </b></p>
<p><b>The young British historian Niall Ferguson, for example, had no doubts. 
  &quot;The United States,&quot; he said, &quot;is an empire in every sense but 
  one, and that one sense is that it doesn't recognise itself as such.&quot; He 
  called it &quot;an empire in denial.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>Strobe Talbott, former Deputy Secretary of State in the Clinton administration, 
  found the notion of the US as an empire &quot;grotesque, bizarre or laughable, 
  depending upon what mood I'm in and who says it&quot;. He said that, if anything, 
  it was an anti-empire. &quot;There is no interest among American people to set 
  themselves up as an imperial power.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>For others, like Michael Mandelbaum of the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced 
  International Studies, America's current position is unique - there simply is 
  not an adequate word to describe it. As he put it: &quot;Empire is not quite 
  right but it seems to be closer than anything else we have in common usage, 
  so we employ it.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>Empire or not, there is a growing feeling around the world that America's 
  unrivalled power is in some sense a problem. It is something that Strobe Talbott 
  recognises with regret. &quot;When our friends around the world get together 
  behind our backs, they talk about the problem of American power, how to cope 
  with it, manage it, even how to contain it. &quot;That is not the way we want 
  others to think about us.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>Globalisation meets 9/11...Today one of the buzz-words of international 
  politics is globalisation. It too is not an easy term to define; it encompasses 
  the spread of market capitalism and the new communications technologies. These 
  seem to be shrinking the world and eliminating diversity. Many trace a foreign 
  policy shift to the events of 11 September 2001 </b></p>
<p><b>Globalisation and US dominance are inextricably bound up....The world of 
  globalisation that was opened up by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the 
  end of the Cold War seemed almost designed for the US, accelerating the emergence 
  of American superpowerdom. For Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government 
  at Harvard University, US dominance has been a fact for years. But it was the 
  tragedy of 11 September which presented America's position in a stark new light. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>Indeed, we began our series at Ground Zero in New York, the site of the 
  Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Many people believe that it was from 
  the rubble of the towers that a more assertive and ideological foreign policy 
  emerged. Afghanistan and Iraq were invaded. President Bush proclaimed a new 
  doctrine of pre-emptive military action. </b></p>
<p><b>So how does the current position compare with the great empires of the past. 
  Is America just the latest in a long line of dominant powers? Or is it really 
  unique? Fareed Zakaria of Newsweek International, fast becoming one of America's 
  most interesting foreign policy pundits, insists that there has never been anything 
  quite like America's dominance of the world. There have been other great powers, 
  like the British Empire, but none have towered over their rivals in the way 
  the United States does.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg138a.gif" width="527" height="237"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b>The United States of America...The Eighth Western Empire 
      to hold the Oracles of God captive...(Revelation 17:9-18).</b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>US defence spending dwarfs any of its rivals....American dominance is not 
  just military; it is economic. US popular culture has spread around the globe. 
  There is what Mr Zakaria terms &quot;a comprehensive uni-polarity&quot; that 
  nobody has seen since Rome dominated the world. The Romans with their language, 
  currency and the spread of Roman citizenship perhaps foreshadowed an early form 
  of globalisation. </b></p>
<p><b>Niall Ferguson believes it is the British Empire that offers one of the 
  best parallels. He argues that if you look at what the US has long tried to 
  do - expand the global reach of free markets and ultimately representative government 
  - it bears an uncanny resemblance to what he characterises as the project of 
  Victorian Imperialism. </b></p>
<p><b>But there is another side to this whole debate. Joseph Nye of the Kennedy 
  school of Government believes that all the talk of US dominance and influence 
  obscures a much more fundamental reality. He calls it &quot;THE PRADOX OF AMERICAN 
  POWER&quot;, by which he means that for all its global might, the US is unable 
  to get the outcomes it wants by acting alone. He argues that in terms of issues 
  like countering transnational terrorism, dealing with the spread of infectious 
  diseases, global climate change, international financial stability, none can 
  be managed by any one country. The message for US policy-makers, he says, is 
  simple. &quot;We are the strongest nation the world has seen for some two millennia 
  and yet we can't get what we want by acting alone&quot;. </b></p>
