    ELISHA BEN ABUYAH </b></p>
  <p align="left"> <b>ELISHA BEN ABUYAH (c. AD. 100), a unique figure among the 
    Palestinian Jews of the first Christian century.</b> He was born before the 
    destruction of the Temple (which occurred in A.D. 70) and <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(another 
    who adopted the name)</font> survived into the 2nd century. It is not easy 
    to decide as to his exact attitude towards Judaism. <b>That he refused to 
    accept the current rabbinical views is certain, though the Talmud cites his 
    legal decisions. Most authorities believe that he was a Gnostic</b>; <b>but 
    while it is certain that he was not a Christian</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(or 
    so this author believes)</font>, it is possible that he was simply a Sadducee, 
    <b>and thus an opponent not of Judaism but of Pharisaism</b>. One of his disciple, 
    a Pharisee, remained his steadfast friend, and his efforts to reclaim his 
    former master are among the most pathetic incidents in the Talmud. In later 
    ages <b>Elisha (alias 'the other,' as he was named) was regarded as the type 
    of a heretic whose pride of intellect betrayed him into infidelity to law 
    and morals </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Romans, chapter 
    7...KJV)</font><b>.</b> Without much appropriateness Elisha has been sometimes 
    described as the Faust of the Talmud. (I. A.)</p>

  <p> By : Louis Ginzberg </p>
  <p align="left">Born <b><a href="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif">in Jerusalem</a></b> 
    before 70; flourished in Palestine at the end of the first century and the 
    beginning of the second. At one time the Rabbis were proud to recognize him 
    as of their number; <b>but later their opposition to him grew so intense that 
    they even refrained from pronouncing his name</b>, and referred to him in 
    terms used to designate some vile object (&quot;dabar acher,&quot; lit. &quot;another 
    thing&quot;). <b>For this reason it is almost impossible to derive from rabbinical 
    sources a clear picture of his personality, and modern historians have differed 
    greatly in their estimate of him.</b> According to Gr&auml;tz, he was a Karpotian 
    <b>Gnostic</b>; according to Siegfried, a follower of Philo; according to 
    Dubsch, <b>a Christian</b>; according to Smolenskin and Weiss, a victim of 
    the inquisitor Akiba.</p>
  <p>Youth and Activity.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Of Elisha's youth and of his activity as a teacher of the 
    Law very little is known</b>. He was the son of an esteemed and rich citizen 
    of Jerusalem, and was trained for the career of a scholar. His praise of this 
    method of education is the only saying that the Mishnah has found worth perpetuating. 
    According to Abot iv. 25, his favorite saying was, <b>&quot;Learning in youth 
    is like writing upon new paper, but learning in old age is like writing upon 
    paper which has already been used.&quot;</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Matthew 
    9:14-17). </font><b>Elisha was a student of Greek</b>; as the Talmud expresses 
    it, &quot;Aher's tongue was never tired of singing Greek songs&quot; (Yer. 
    Meg. i. 9), <b>which, according to some, caused his apostasy</b> (?ag. 16b, 
    below). Bacher has very properly remarked that the similes which Elisha is 
    reported to have used (Ab. R. N. xxiv.) show that he was a man of the world, 
    acquainted with wine, horses, and architecture. He must have acquired a reputation 
    as an authority in questions of religious practise, since in Mo'ed 20a one 
    of his halakic decisions is recorded&#151;the only one in his name, though 
    there may be others under the names of different teachers. <b>The Babylonian 
    Talmud asserts that Elisha, while a teacher in the bet ha-midrash, kept forbidden 
    books (&quot;sifre minim&quot;) hidden in his clothes.</b> This statement 
    is not found in the Jerusalem Talmud, and if at all historical, may possibly 
    mean that he also studied the writings of the Sadducees, who, owing to changes 
    made by the censors, are sometimes called &quot;minim.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The oldest and most striking reference to the views of Elisha 
    is found in the following baraita (?ag. 14b; Yer. ii. 1): <b>&quot;Four [sages] 
    entered paradise</b>&#151;Ben 'Azzai, Ben Zoma, <b>Aher</b>, and Akiba. Ben 
    'Azzai looked and died; Ben Zoma went mad; <b>Aher destroyed the plants</b>; 
    Akiba alone came out unhurt.&quot;</p>
  <p><b><a href="Paradise.htm">The Four Who Entered Paradise.</a></b></p>
  <p align="left">There can be no doubt that the journey of the &quot;four&quot; 
    to paradise, like the ascension of Enoch (in the pre-Christian books of Enoch) 
    and of so many other pious men, is to be taken literally and not allegorically. 
    This conception of the baraita is supported by the use of the phrase (&quot;entered 
    paradise&quot;), since (&quot;entered the Garden of Eden&quot; = paradise) 
    was a common expression v; Ab. R. N. xxv.). <b>It means that Elisha, like 
    Paul, in a moment of ecstasy beheld the interior of heaven&#151;in the former's 
    case, however, with the effect that he destroyed the plants of the heavenly 
    garden.</b></p>
  <p align="left">The Talmud gives two different interpretations of this last 
    phrase. The Babylonian Talmud says:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What is the meaning of 'Aher destroyed the plants'? Scripture 
    refers to him (Eccl. v. 5 [A. V. 6]) when it says: 'Suffer not thy mouth to 
    cause thy flesh to sin.' What does this signify? In heaven <b>Aher saw Metatron 
    seated while he wrote down the merits of Israel</b>. Whereupon Aher said: 
    'We have been taught to believe that no one sits in heaven, . . . <b>or are 
    there perhaps two supreme powers?'</b> Then a heavenly voice was heard: 'Turn, 
    O backsliding children (Jer. iii. 14), with the exception of Aher.'&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The Talmudic Explanation.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The dualism with which the Talmud charges him has led some 
    scholars to see here Persian, Gnostic, or even Philonian dualism. They forget 
    that the reference here to Metatron&#151;a specifically Babylonian idea, which 
    would probably be unknown to Palestinian rabbis even five hundred years after 
    Elisha&#151;robs the passage of all historical worth.</b> The story is of 
    late origin, as is seen from the introductory words, which stand in no connection 
    with the context, as they do in the parallel passage in the Jerusalem Talmud. 
    This latter makes no mention of Elisha's dualism; but it relates that in the 
    critical period following the rebellion of Bar Kokba, Elisha visited the schools 
    and attempted to entice the students from the study of the Torah, in order 
    to direct their energies to some more practical occupation; and it is to him, 
    therefore, that the verse &quot;Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to 
    sin &quot;(Eccl. v. 5) is to be applied. In connection with this the Biblical 
    quotation is quite intelligible, as according to another haggadah (Shab. 34b; 
    Eccl. R. v. 5) &quot;flesh&quot; here means children&#151;spiritual children, 
    pupils&#151;whom Elisha killed with his mouth by luring them from the study 
    of the Torah. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Romans, chapters 
    10 and 11)</font>.</p>
  <p align="left">The Babylonia amoraim must have known this story, from which 
    they took the concluding part and attached it to another legend. The Jerusalem 
    Talmud is also the authority for the statement that Elisha played the part 
    of an informer during the Hadrianic persecutions, when the Jews were ordered 
    to violate the laws of the Torah. As evidence of this it is related that when 
    the Jews were ordered to do work on the Sabbath, they tried to perform it 
    in a way which could be considered as not profaning the Sabbath. But Elisha 
    betrayed the Pharisees to the Roman authorities. Thus it is probable that 
    the antipathy of Elisha was not directed against Judaism in general, but only 
    against Pharisaism. The reason given for his apostasy is also characteristic. 
    He saw how one man had lost his life while fulfilling a law for the observance 
    of which the Torah promised a long life (Deut. xxii. 7), whereas another man 
    who broke the same law was not hurt in the least. This practical demonstration, 
    as well as the frightful sufferings of the martyrs during the Hadrianic persecutions, 
    strengthened his conviction that there was no reward for virtue in this life 
    or the next. These statements of the Jerusalem Talmud are no doubt based on 
    reliable tradition, as they are also confirmed by the Babylonian Talmud (?id. 
    39b). <b>Bearing in mind what is said about Elisha, there can be little doubt 
    that he was a Sadducee</b>.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Galatians 
    1:10-24; Philippians 3:1-6)</font>.</p>
  <p>Elisha an &quot;Epicurean&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The harsh treatment he received from the Pharisees was due 
    to his having deserted their ranks at such a critical time</b>. Quite in harmony 
    with this supposition are the other sins laid to his charge; namely, that 
    he rode in an ostentatious manner through the streets of Jerusalem on a Day 
    of Atonement which fell upon a Sabbath, and that he was bold enough to overstep 
    the (the limits of the Sabbath-day journey) <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Acts 
    1:12)</font>. Both the Jerusalem and the Babylonian Talmuds agree here, and 
    cite this as proof that <b>Elisha turned from Pharisaism to heresy</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Acts 
    17:17-20)</font>. It was just such non-observance of customs that excited 
    the anger of Akiba (Sotah 27b). The mention of the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; 
    in this passage is not an anachronism, as Gr&auml;tz thinks. For while it 
    is true that Eliezer and Joshua were present as the geonim par excellence 
    at Elisha's circumcision&#151;which must, therefore, have occurred <b>after 
    the death of Johanan ben Zakkai</b> (80 C.E.)&#151;it is also true that the 
    &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; is likewise mentioned in connection with Rabbi 
    Akiba; indeed, the use of this expression is due to the fact that the Rabbis 
    held holiness to be inherent in the place, not in the building (Yeb. 6b).</p>
  <p align="left">The same passage from the Jerusalem Talmud refers to Elisha 
    as being alive when his pupil R. Me&iuml;r had become a renowned teacher. 
    According to the assumption made above, he must have reached his seventieth 
    year at that time. If Elisha were a Sadducee, the friendship constantly shown 
    him by R. Me&iuml;r could be understood. This friendship would have been impossible 
    had Elisha been an apostate or a man of loose morals, as has been asserted. 
    Sadducees and Pharisees, however, lived in friendly intercourse with one another 
    (for example, Rabban Gamaliel with Sadducees; 'Er. 77b). For legends concerning 
    Elisha see Johanan ben Nappa?a; Me&iuml;r; compare also Gnosticism.</p>
