<p><b>December 7, 2003: My brother's family invited me to Sunday Mass this morning 
  at Edward the Confessor Church in Syosset, New York. The first page of the program 
  read: </b> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Make ready the way of the Lord, clear him a straight path...Come Lord 
    Jesus</b></p>
  <p><b>THE GOSPEL MESSAGE...Luke 3:1-6. &quot;WITH OR WITHOUT YOU...Think about 
    the last time you got involved at church, more involved than just attending 
    Mass. For some of us it might be a long and painful dredging of our memories, 
    so much time has passed. Oh we're willing and able, but we're used to letting 
    more experienced and eager volunteers get there first. Its easy to get complacent...as 
    long as the work gets done in the end. But how do we know the work is done? 
    While we're admiring other's efficiency, it's hard to see the missing part: 
    what we could have added. Sure that ministry, or a service will &quot;get 
    by&quot; without us, but who knows what it could accomplish with us?</b></p>
  <p><b>Consider John the Baptist. He didn't ask who else volunteered, or if someone 
    was more qualified. John simply got up, got out and did the job that needed 
    doing. Now John wasn't the only traveling preacher in Jordan, and maybe he 
    wasn't even the best preacher. But because John was willing, people's hearts 
    and minds were prepared for Jesus' arrival. Think of the souls and lives that 
    might have been lost, had John left his job to someone else. Are you thinking 
    that God's work will get done with or without someone like you? Think again.&quot;</b></p>

  <p><b>FIRST READING...A READING FROM THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET BARUCH</b></p>
  <p><b>Jerusalem, take off your robe of mourning and misery; put on the splendour 
    of glory from God forever: wrapped in the cloak of justice from God, bear 
    on your head the mitre that displays the glory of the Eternal Name.</b></p>
  <p><b>For God will show all the earth your splendor: you will be named by God 
    forever the peace of justice, the glory of God's worship.</b></p>
  <p><b>Up, Jerusalem! stand upon the heights; look to the east and see your children 
    gathered from the east and west at the Word of the Holy One, rejoicing that 
    they are remembered by God.</b></p>
  <p><b>Led away on foot by their enemies they left you: but God will bring them 
    back to you born aloft in glory as on royal thrones.</b></p>
  <p><b>For God has commanded that every mountain </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(every 
    nation)</font><b> be made low, and that the age-old depths and gorges be filled 
    to level ground, that Israel may advance secure in the Glory of God.</b></p>

    GOD'S COMMAND; for God is leading Israel in joy by the light of his glory, 
    with his mercy and justice for company.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>VATICAN ISSUES NEW, FINE-TUNED GUIDELINES ON MASS</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>by David O'Reilly </b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>PHILADELPHIA, January 11, 2004</b> __<b>Jim Rosengarten gasped when he 
    learned the Vatican wants him to stop calling himself a eucharistic minister. 
    Rosengarten may still distribute communion to shut-ins and at Mass at St. 
    Vincent's parish in Philadelphia's Germantown, as he has done for years.</b></p>
  <p><b>But under the Roman Catholic Church's new guidelines for the celebration 
    of the Mass, THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ASSIST THE PRIEST THIS WAY are expected 
    to henceforth use their proper titles. They are &quot;extraordinary ministers 
    of holy communion.&quot; &quot;Oh, my God,&quot; Rosengarten exclaimed. &quot;What 
    a shame.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>It was not the title's mouthful of syllables that disturbed him, he said, 
    but the Vatican's reasons: IT WANTS THE PRIESTS ROLE AT MASS UNAMBIGUOUSLY 
    DISTINCT. ONLY THE PRIEST CONSECRATES THE BREAD AND THE WINE, THE ESSENTIAL 
    ACT OF EUCHARIST. The distinction is just one of dozens of refinements that 
    Catholics worldwide may encounter at Mass in the year ahead. </b></p>
  <p><b>Dismayed by the many small local variations that have crept into the celebration 
    of the liturgy around the world (and also by a blurring of the priest's role 
    in some churches), ROME IS CALLING FOR NEAR-UNIFORMITY IN THE WAY MASSES ARE 
    CELEBRATED.</b></p>
  <p><b>The Vatican has codified and clarified virtually every detail--when to 
    stand, who wears what, how to drink from the chalice, how to hold a gospel 
    book--and put it into a 100-page document called the General Instruction for 
    the Roman Missal. It replaces the previous general instruction of 1985.</b></p>
  <p><b>The Rev. Daniel Mackle, head of the Philadelphia Archdiocese Office for 
    Worship, praised the guidelines as necessary. In some parishes, Mackle said, 
    the Mass &quot;has become like a painting coated in candle soot. IT HAS TO 
    BE CLEANED UP SO WE CAN SEE THE TRUE BEAUTY.&quot; Pope John Paul II approved 
    the new instruction's original Latin Version three years ago, but it was only 
    last March that the Vatican's Congregation for Divine Worship approved the 
    English language version for the United States. </b></p>
  <p><b>Mackle has been asking parishes in his diocese to start with an inventory 
    of all the prayers, hymns, Scripture readings, processionals and other rituals 
    of their liturgies, and compare them with the carefully prescribed order of 
    the general instruction...</b></p>
  <p><b>While some of the directives may seem modest, Mackle said THERE IS THEOLOGY 
    BEHIND ALMOST EVERY DETAIL OF THE MASS, WHICH IN THE CATHOLIC TRADITION RE-ENACTS 
    THE LAST SUPPER AND JESUS' DEATH AND RESURRECTION.</b></p>
  <p><b>For example, he said, the book of the Gospels is carried at the entrance 
    processional but not at the recessional, &quot;BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED 
    THE WORD OF GOD DURING THE MASS, AND ARE NOW CARRYING IT WITHIN US AND OUT 
    INTO THE WORLD.&quot; </b></p>
