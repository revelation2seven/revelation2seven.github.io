<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The original form of human 
    spiritual expression was animism, in which nature was seen as sacred itself. 
    This took various forms. There was a sense of the sacred in the land as a 
    whole: the earth was alive. Topography could be anthropomorphised--here were 
    hills that looked like breasts of the Earth Mother, there a rocky cragg that 
    looked like the face of a god. The landscape became the stage for legendary 
    events and beings, the creatures of mythic times. In a slightly more focused 
    form of animism, selected places such as hilltops, rocks, trees, waterfalls, 
    and so on were seen as being inhabited by spirits--hence the idea of 'spirit 
    of place,' 'genius loci.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Out of the universal magico-spiritual 
    background of animism and totemism emerged the catalytic religious phenomenon 
    of Shamanism. </font>(Please discover those studies that trace the Hebrew 
    order of prophets and priests from an earlier order of Shamanism)...<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    shaman was an intermediary between the spirit world of nature and the tribe. 
    Through what Mircea Eliade called 'archaic techniques of ecstasy'...the shaman 
    would enter trance or altered states of consciousness, and travel to the spirit 
    world in order to seek information required by the tribe. The shaman could 
    see back in time and was the repository of tribal history. He or she could 
    even see ahead in time and predict coming events...An important element in 
    Shamanism, as we shall discover, was the ability to travel in mind through 
    (or above) the environment and observe distant events.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The basic shamanic cosmology consisted 
    of Three worlds, the Middle Earth of human reality, the Upper world of spiritual 
    beings, and the hellish Underworld. Access to these otherworlds was by means 
    of a conceptual Axis that linked them: a World-Tree, a Cosmic Mountain...By 
    symbolically travelling along this axis, in whatever form, the shaman could 
    ascend to heaven or enter deeply into the body of the Earth, the Underworld.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In some cases where shamanism was 
    performed by a single individual </font>(or where two individuals were called 
    together as was Adam)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, the role 
    of the priest was born. The shaman was characterized by trance while the priest 
    conducted routine propitiatory acts of adoration, prayer, and offerings...with 
    a gradual shift from hut to temple...In societies which became more structured 
    and hierarchal, theocracies appeared: Religious rule, in which priesthood 
    and government were combined. In certain instances this evolved into the idea 
    of the chief being divine, and celestial lineage was claimed: the Divine King...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Let us realize here that the true, higher order of Hebrew priests 
  (the shaman-prophets and prophetesses who appeared over time along that line 
  on the Tree of Life which led from Aaron to John the Baptist, <a href="../../UsedImages/pg17topisaiahweb2.gif">to 
  the Remnant</a> in our time), never aligned itself with any worldly, or earth-born 
  governments (not with Pharaoh or Caesar), nor with any even theocratic attempts 
  to create a (mere) image of the spiritual-order-above in the temporal-order-below, 
  as the mind of Israel was constantly inclined to in ancient times, and as Christianity 
  has since the time of Christ. These priests and prophets have always been adversaries 
  of such systems--and witnesses against the ongoing adulterous relationships 
  that existed in every generation between the (worldly) priests and ministers 
  of the precepts of the Universal Israel and the other nations of the earth. 
  Such relationships are characterized everywhere in the scriptures as the Worship 
  of Ba'al. (see 1 Kings 18: 19-36; James, chapter 4). These priests, called of 
  the Spirit and not of men (see Hebrews 5:1-4) have served no governments, nor 
  have they offered praises or obeisance to any earthly kings (or presidents), 
  save the KING ABOVE.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What I shall be developing in the 
    second part of this book is the suggestion that the motif of the ceremonial, 
    Straight landscape-line originated in one of the central elements of shamanic 
    experience, and the range of surviving linear features in ancient sacred landscapes 
    itself reflects this kind of evolution...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An Indo-European clue...Without 
    doubt shamanic elements were found in Indo-European mythological texts...Eliade 
    noted that vestiges of shamanic tradition in Indo-European religious life 
    were principally grouped about the mythical figure of the terrifying Sovereign. 
    </font>(Understand Psalm 48:1,2; 2 Corinthians 5:11; Hebrews 10:31)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...According 
    to G. Dumezil's findings, the priestly class embraced the function of sovereignty, 
    combining both legal order and magico-religious roles...This functional ambiguity 
    of sovereignty relates to the kingship-shamanism complex, and brings us to 
    a crucial word that existed in the proto-Indo-European language: 'Reg--,' 
    (King). This ancient linguistic treasure brings the concept of Straight Lines 
    into that complex, and brings us to the central core of our inquiry...</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">(It also brings us, as we have already noted, to the words 
  of Isaiah, and John the Baptist after him: <i>Make Straight the Way of the Lord</i>; 
  and the words in Hebrews, saying: <i>Make a Straight path for your Feet</i>):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The apex of proto-Indo-European 
    society...was ruled by a king whose title has usually been secured by the 
    textbook series: Sanskrit RAI; Latin REX; Gaulis RIX, Old Irish RI; and possibly 
    Thracian RHEOS. This proto-Indo-European REG also provides such meanings as 
    Stretch, draw out in STRAIGHT LINES, and Straighten. </font>(see Luke 12:50)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Our English word &quot;Right' is a reflex of this root, and the same opposition 
    which we employ between what is 'straight' or 'right' and what is bent or 
    crooked, dishonest or wrong, is encountered throughout the Indo-European languages...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jan Gonda and Emile Benveniste 
    sought in the basic etymology of the word a hint of the original function 
    of the word REG-. Gonda suggested that the word meant 'ONE WHO STRETCHES OR 
    REACHES OUT,' a metaphor for the formal activities of a king...Benveniste 
    proposed that there might have been more overtly priestly functions associated 
    with the proto-Indo-European king in that the root meaning of 'stretching 
    out' or 'straigtening' might be associated with duties such as laying out 
    limits, be they demarcations of sacred territory within a settlement...or 
    the borders of national territories.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jim Kimmis was the first to bring 
    ley hunters' attention to Reg-. He pointed out in The Ley Hunter that the 
    physical, spatial, linear associations of the word were extended in an abstract 
    sense to become an analogue of honesty, justice, government, and social order 
    </font>(see Isaiah 9:6,7)...<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Between 
    the physical and abstract</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">senses 
    of this complex word stands a small group of cognates which signify RULER 
    or KING.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The question to be asked, of course, is what have these Indo-European 
  terms to do with the Mystery of Christ and the Semitic state of mind, and the 
  (supposedly) Semitic language in which the Hebrew Scriptures were written? And 
  the point to be expressed, as we have been throughout this work, is that the 
  Hebrew mysteries, which have their root in the ancient Atlantean period of history 
  (from the time of Adam to Noah), were originally disemminated into the world 
  through the wanderings, and in the oral traditions of Indo-European culture. 
  History has recorded their appearances in the East, as far as India, as well 
  as in Egypt even before the First Dynastic period. It was the adepts in these 
  ancient mysteries that brought the name &quot;Egypt&quot; to Egypt, from the 
  West, as well as the name &quot;Ethiopia&quot; to Ethiopia...</font></p>

  Universal Pyramid--the central structure of the Oracle, of the Universal World 
  Tree--to Egypt to begin with, to be built there as a monument in stone and as 
  an &quot;eternal&quot; witness to those things that were hidden Above and as 
  far away as the Western ends of the Earth. (We will return to this subject in 
  a moment)...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In more than one passage 
    in this book I have alluded to the Druid cult with the institution which has 
    come to be known to students of tradition, as the Divine Kingship. I now desire 
    to stress the connection, to establish it beyond doubt. It is the association 
    of the Divine Kingship with Druidism which provides the best proof for the 
    existence of the latter cultus in some Celtic lands...It is, of course, perfectly 
    clear from the evidence that the idea of the Divine Kingship had associations 
    with primitive religious cults other than Druidism; but the nature of the 
    idea underlying all of these was, it is clear, homogenous. All of them, without 
    exception, were cults of fertility in which (the harvest) was regarded as 
    a magical process which emanated from the Divine King, and which was due to 
    the indwelling vitality of the Monarch.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hocart claimed that 'the earliest 
    known religion is a belief in the divinity of kings,' the earthly representative 
    of the gods...that this was certainly the case in Egypt and Sumeria has been 
    proved without question, and the same holds good of early Greece, while the 
    kings of Rome were also recognnized as of divine descent.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Egypt kings were regarded as 
    not only the sons of the Sun-god Ra...but as being actually that deity in 
    his earthly form. Perry believes that this doctrine was established about 
    the year 2750 B.C., </font>(long before the time of Abraham) <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">when 
    the Dynasty associated with Heliopolis and its Solar religion gained the throne 
    of Egypt...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The belief that kings possess magical 
    or supernatural powers by virtue of which they can fertilize the earth and 
    confer other benefits on their subjects would seem to have been shared by 
    the ancestors of all the Aryan races from India to Ireland...'In Ireland,' 
    says Rhys, 'druidism and kingship went hand in hand, nor is it improbable 
    that it was the same in Gaul </font>(or in the hidden center of Europe in 
    the time of D.V.D.)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.' After the 
    fall of the royal power in ancient Rome, it was found necessary to appoint 
    a 'king of sacrifices,' that is, a priest who had to perform certain religious 
    rites connected with the name of a king. The priest of the Golden Bough was 
    also known as 'Rex Nemorensis.' 'King of the Forest,'...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, as we have seen, it was believed 
    that Tree-spirits made the crops to flourish. These Tree-spirits became gods 
    such as the Greek Zeus and the Roman Jupiter, originally gods of the Oak...Irish 
    kings did likewise...(the monarchy was connected with a cult of royal, or 
    famous ancestral spirits identified with the god-race of the Tuath De' Danaan 
    </font>(the peoples or the tribes of Dan)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    who were from time to time reborn as kings. Some of these were Solar gods, 
    indeed the entire race of the Tuath De' Danaan appears to have had a Solar 
    connection, so that the position </font>(of kingship) <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">in 
    Ireland reveals a similarity to that in ancient Egypt). The king's life appears 
    to have been connected with a certain Tree, perhaps that species of Tree in 
    which the spirit of the ancestors was supposed to dwell, who, at the due season 
    of his reincarnation, left his place and entered his mother's body, to be 
    born again as a man.&quot; </font>Druids, Their Origin and History, by Lewis

    Tree of the Sefiroth, or the mystical Human Form, who is none other than the

    numbers in which all reality is rooted--an idea expounded in the Hebrew text 
    roughly contemporary with the ancient idea of<i> Shi'ur Komah</i> (the measure, 
    or the Height of the Godhead) and heavily influenced by Pythagoreanism... 
    However, the medieval kabbalists changed its meaning when they adopted the 
    term 'Sefiroth.' For them the Sefiroth are the potencies constituting the

<p><font size="+1">When these earliest of adepts (these &quot;Druids&quot; and 
  &quot;Chaldeans,&quot; these &quot;Rishis&quot;) appeared in a land, and especially 
  among a people of another language, they immediately--as true evangelists do--adopted 
  the social customs of the people, and learned their languages (if they were 
  not already trained in it before they arrived). They became one with the people 
  in almost every way so that they might in turn pursuade the people to become 
  one with them, or rather with the higher realities, or higher revelations that 
  they represented. In every day matters they spoke the common tongue. To some 
  who became students they taught the language system of their own native land 
  from which they came, and to others who showed themselves as worthy candidates 
  they even passed along the core of the Mysteries themselves. In this way, aside 
  from commerce and technology (the other great engine of cultural diffusion--the 
  method ultimately assigned to the sons of Darkness) the religious traditions 
  of both peoples were melded, and passed from one to the other. And in the process 
  a Fellowship and a certain order of priests (Levites) was created...one that 
  would form the eventual structure of the Judeao-Christian Religion as it was 
  organized under Moses and Aaron...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">But because the Higher mysteries were being intentionally guarded, 
  when these adepts spoke to those outside their fellowship they did so in allegorical 
  and metaphorical terms, and not in direct ways. They spoke about principles 
  instead of specifics, which are applicable to every people everywhere, and about 
  the structure of reality (of heaven and earth, without directly revealing the 
  exact location of that hidden place above, or in the Middle as it were...see 
  Hebrews 9:5)...</font></p>

  provided the later framework and the meaning of Christianity. And neither was 
  the fact that the Hebrew traditions were translated out of the proto-European 
  language into the languages of the East completely concealed either. Despite 
  the fact that it was done &quot;by night&quot; as it were, and in accordance

<p><font size="+1">Conor MacDari, a somewhat pugnacious Irish scholar, with the 
  same fiery zeal for his own purely Irish theory as we discover in certain Jewish 
  and Afro-centrists, in a work entitled <i>Irish Wisdom Preserved in Bible and 
  Pyramids</i>, says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Irish brought religion 
    and civilization to Egypt and that religion was Sun Worship. The word &quot;Jew&quot; 
    is derived from an idiomatic Irish word Iudh (Yudh), meaning the day or light. 
    It alludes to the Priests of the Sun </font>(the Mystery of Christ...Malachi 
    4)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, and followers of the light, 
    those who had wisdom. The word 'Iudh' is camouflaged when it is converted 
    into English by using the letter J instead of I to begin the word, there being 
    no J in the Irish alphabet...There are other idiomatic names in the Irish 
    language for 'Jew' and 'Hebrew' which give unmistakable proof that they are 
    soley and truly of Irish origin. One of these names for Jew is 'Iuil' (pronounced 
    Yul). It expresses the attributes of the Sun when it is at His highest power 
    and dignity, and is the name for the month Iuil (July)...</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A recent writer in the public press 
    made the statement that 'the Irish language was spoken in the Garden of Eden,' 
    thereby implying that it was the God-given and original language of 'Adam' 
    and 'Eve' and of the first patriarchs (Biblical Characters), and of the Master 
    Adepts who wrote the first scriptures and formulated the mythical legend of 
    our first parents, placing them in the garden...There is no doubt as to whom 
    we are indebted for the Bible. It is the plainest and most evident truth,

    White Lions Into the Heart of Human Evolution</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1960 Vasamazulu 
    Credo Mutwa broke the &quot;Oath of Silence&quot; that had bound him and other 
    high shamans to a secret oral tradition. Mutwa understands that we live in 
    prophetic times, when it is imperitive to transmit knowledge to humanity at 
    large. In speaking of secrets intended only for the highest shamanic initiates, 
    it is believed that he has brought a curse upon himself, his children and 
    his children's children...Personally I have...come to regard Mutwa's delivery 
    of this oral tradition as an act of unparalleled courage--worthy of the highest-ranking 
    lion shaman I know him to be...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There could be no 
    clearer indication that this is not localised knowledge but that it signals 
    a system of enlightenment which crosses continents and centuries: what Mutwa 
    himself calls &quot;the Great Knowledge.&quot; This African shaman's understanding 
    of the lost language of the ancients (Ogham) corresponds with the inscriptions 
    deciphered on Easter Island; his African stories of &quot;white Gods&quot; 
    have bearing on the &quot;white God&quot; of the Meso-Americans; his knowledge 
    of the stars in the African skies takes us right back to the Ancient Egyptians. 
    While Mutwa has dedicated his life to handing over secrets from the Great 
    African Tradition, it remains for us to make the astonishing intercontinental 
    connections.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mutwa has lived under 
    condemnation ever since he broke the secret code, and delivered hidden knowledge 
    to the common man. Is his drive to reveal the truth so difficult to understand? 
    The Bible talks of &quot;knowledge&quot; in the same breath as &quot;forbidden 
    fruits.&quot; Why are we afraid of knowing the truth? Why has it been imprinted 
    upon our collective consciousness that knowledge is sinful, and why do we 
    fear the consequences of knowing? The first lesson of Lion shamanism is to 
    conquer fear. Fear is conquered through the principles of love, truth and 
    enlightenment. Himself a living embodiment of these founding principles of 
    Lion shamanism, Mutwa has been prepared to endure the great personal cost 
    of his courageous action. If it is true that we are living at a crucial evolutionary 
    watershed for humankind, it is imperitive that we open the routes to knowledge 
    which may have a critical part to play in our evolutionary development. </font>(pp.14,15)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In was Maria, the lion-shaman woman of Timbavati, who directed 
  the author to Credo Mutwa. It was she who first opened the author's mind to 
  the Lion-king mysteries of the African plains:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At my expression, Maria's expression 
    lightened with humor, and she remarked that Timbavati means &quot;the river 
    that never runs dry.&quot; This seemed a curious name for a region made up 
    entirely of empty watercourses and arid sodic deposits. She says it means 
    &quot;river of stars,&quot; the interpreter continued.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seemed (to me) she was referring 
    to the Milky Way which, come to think of it, never did run dry in the manner 
    of the Timbavati watercourses. &quot;She says it is the same river where the 
    White Lions come from.&quot; Now she had lost me. The fire was shining in 
    Maria's cloudy eye. She was looking straight at me. so that I felt the force 
    of her communication but could not identify it. &quot;Ask Maria to explain 
    further,&quot; I instructed the interpreter...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After listening to my translated 
    words, Maria made a curt, sweeping gesture to the sky above us...&quot;Maria 
    says that her ancestors have told her that a long time ago, when the river 
    was in the sky </font>(above)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> many 
    people died. When the river is in this position again, the same will befall

    was spangled with what looked like a watercourse of droplets: the Milky Way,

    rise to the mysterious legends of White Lions. </font>(Please consider Genesis

    who knows the story of their origins.&quot; &quot;That is not true, ma'am. 
    There are many in our ranks who know the story, but are sworn to secrecy. 
    It is only I who have been bold enough to speak of such things...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maria had also revealed that Mutwa 
    was the custodian of some of the holiest artifacts of the African continent. 
    Over the course of future encounters, Mutwa would show me over fifty items 
    in his possession--great pieces of copper, bronze, verdite and crystal, some 
    once belonging to the mightiest of kings, some inscribed with cryptic symbols, 
    many dating from a time when, Credo Mutwa says, an ancient seafaring civilisation, 
    neither of African birth nor of African race, came to African shores...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It was my grandfather, ma'am, 
    who was the only person capable of curing me when I was struck down by an 
    incurable sickness which had kept me bedridden and unconscious for three years 
    right here in Soweto. It was during this time that I had many terrifying visions, 
    ma'am, some of which we sangomas call the &quot;sacred dreams&quot; that occur 
    before you become a sangoma. I had the vision of the earth stretched out like 
    a lion-skin pegged at all four corners--north, south, east and west--with 
    the four lion brothers tearing at it in four directions. WE call this dream 
    :the Sacred Dream of End Time&quot;...<i>Nedelo Ntulo</i>.&quot; In our tradition 
    we believe...that the universe is sustained by Four great forces and in the 
    center is the Fifth power, <i>Nxaka-Nxaka</i>, meaning &quot;confusion&quot;

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;At first I could not understand 
    how the spirit of the Star God lives in every thing,&quot; Mutwa continued. 
    &quot;I was very stupid in those days. When I first asked my grandfather how 
    it was that everyone and everything has God within them...He took me outside...and 
    showed me his favorite Tree, a tall, fruit-bearing fig tree which he had planted 
    when he was a young man. He demanded what I thought this Tree was. I told 
    him, 'A tree, Grandfather.'...He told me that in the days when he himself 
    was a child in old Africa, and in the centuries before--in the time of our 
    Zulu ancestors--trees were not called 'trees' but 'growing people.'&quot;

  in their land--if certain Afro-centric theories are true), the true spiritual 
  adepts of those ancient times had no such difficulties with each other. They 
  were each walking in the Spirit of God--the very One who dwells equally and 
  majestically in every people on earth. These reasonings from the North (or more 
  anciently, from the West), must have been understood by the religious minds 
  in Africa, and accepted readily for both their great simplicity, and their great 
  synchronicity; and because in every archetypal way these principles were already 
  the reasoning of the shamans and priests of the African peoples to begin with. 
  Only now they would assume a Universal Structure--one to which all of the adepts 
  in the hidden science, in every land, were privy, creating in essence a Greater 
  Lodge--or a true Universal Fellowship of the Mystery. This Fellowship still 
  exists in the earth, and is recognized by its common assent: of the things of 
  God and of each other. (We want to apologize, however, to those who insist that 
  these mysteries originated there in Africa. It simply is not so. [Please review 
  chapter 2]. If the &quot;Ethiopia&quot; spoken of in the second chapter of Genesis 
  was originally situated in Africa, then those who presently hold this theory 
  would be there--that is, they would not be studying and contending about these 
  things here in America, but there in Africa where the Great Circle must of necessity 
  complete itself before anyone can have access once again to the mysteries of 
  the Tree of Life. And then the spirit of Antichrist would also have to be revealed 
  in that land, as it is written: <i>Behold...He is a tall Cedar in the Garden 
  of God...</i>Ezekiel 31)... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The name &quot;Ethiopia&quot; was carried to the headwaters 
  of the Nile by those who arrived there from the West, or with the mysteries 
  of the West. The land of the Nile, crafted by the hands of God Herself, provided 
  the adepts of this science with three geo-metaphysical ingredients: the waters 
  of the Nile moved northward, in a direction pointing back to its own spiritual 
  source in the garden of Eden; the Sun stood directly over this land on the day 
  of the Summer Solstice (the correct place to build such Solar structures as 
  the pyramids, whose dimensions were dedicated to the spiritual dimensions of 
  the greater Solar Mystery, whose spiritual Solstice would carry the spiritual 
  mind along its own hidden path to the center of the Oracles in the North); and 
  the upper and lower regions of this land provided the ideal means of portraying 
  the fact that the Greater Egypt Above also had an Upper kingdom there in the 
  East, and a Lower kingdom here in the West. The greatest King of all was the 
  one who could unite the Two, at the Center. To accomplish this, however, such 
  a king would have to be able to fly high above Egypt, and with the eyes of a 
  Hawk, as it were, survey all the kingdoms of the earth in a single glance. Thus 
  the well known connection between Horus (the Hawkeyed) and Christ...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And as everyone can attest, the land of Palestine--a literal 
  3-day journey into the wilderness (see Exodus 5:3)--was not a land <i>flowing 
  with milk and honey</i>, but bare and barren as the human soul is in its natural 
  state. Thus it provided the ideal place to build the initial, or lower precincts 
  of that City whose streets and by-ways would eventually lead its citizens, not 
  only to a higher, fruitful state of mind, but through all of its dead ends and 
  contradictions, to the reality of that City Above. And finally--after the greater 
  Three-day journey--it would lead the mind of the people to the Western ends 
  of the earth and to the extreme precincts of the Great City before returning 
  them to the Center again in the Mystery of Christ:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Joseph A Seiss, in his <i>The Great Pyramid, a Miracle in Stone, 
  </i>says of one John Taylor:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Canvassing the whole problem 
    in light of history, religion, and science, he came to some very surprising 
    conclusions involving an altogether new departure in Pyramid investigations, 
    and enunciating a number of facts with regard to the mathematical features 
    of the Great Pyramid, which once were ridiculed, but are now generally admitted 
    as true. In 1859 he published a volume, in which he proposed to recover 'a 
    lost leaf in the world's history,' and gave his processes and the results. 
    Without having seen the Great Pyramid, but on the basis of facts recorded 
    by others, he gave it as his theory and conviction that the real architects 
    of this ediface were not Egyptians, but those of quite another faith and branch 
    of the human family, who, by an impulse and commission from heaven, and by 
    the special aid of the Most High, induced and superintended the erection of 
    the mighty structure, as a memorial for times long after, to serve as a witness 
    of inspiration, and of the truth, and purposes of God, over against the falsities 
    and corruptions of a degenerate and ever degenerating world. In other words 
    he claimed to find, in the shape, arrangements, measures, and various indications 
    of the Great Pyramid, an intellectuality and numerical knowledge of grand 
    cosmological phenomena of earth and heaven, which neither Egypt nor any of 
    the nations possessed, or could even understand, from a thousand years ago, 
    back to the origins of the nations. </font>(p.33)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Herodotus says that this and other pyramids were built by forced 
  labor. (Perhaps he was alluding to the story of the Exodus). So we wonder if 
  those who superintended the building of them were the original adepts in these 
  sciences, or a later amalgam of architects, masons, and other well-educated 
  and influential members of the National Lodge, who only possessed some residual 
  knowledge of these things, as do the members of the modern Masonic Temple in 
  our time. We wonder if it was just their minds that were connected to the &quot;esoteric&quot; 
  work at hand (for higher reasons that they no longer fully understood), while 
  their hearts were connected to that of Pharaoh's, and all the grandiose ideas 
  and the political intrigues of their times. Nevertheless...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From this also (the Pyramid) would 
    seem to have its name. Though different authors have sought to derive this 
    word from the Greek, Arabic, and other sources, the evidence is rather that 
    it came directly from the builders of the ediface, and was meant to describe 
    it in the common language then used in the country. The nearest to that language 
    is Coptic. And in Coptic 'pyr' means 'division,' the same as 'peres' in Daniel's 
    interpretation of the handwriting on the wall; and 'met' means 'Ten.' Chevalier 
    Bunsen without thought of combining them for the dirivation of the word Pyramid, 
    gives these words separately...And putting them together--Pyr-Met--we have 
    the name given to this structure. And that name in the language of the ancient 
    Egyptians means The Division of Ten. </font>(Thus the Division of the Great 
    Mandala of the Tree of Life--East and West)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Accordingly a system of FIVENESS

    reference to the Great Pyramid in the Book of Job, 'Who is this that darkeneth 
    counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up thy loins like a man, for I will 
    demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I layed the Foundations 
    of the earth? Declare if thou knowest? Or who hath laid the measures, or who 
    hath stretched a line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations fastened...or 
    who hath layed the cornerstone thereof, when the Morning Stars sang together?'&quot;

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If this Pyramid is what it 
    would seem to be, it would be natural to infer that it ought to have some 
    connections with or reference to Jerusalem. All the institutions and revelations 
    of God had their chief center there for more than a thousand years. God made 
    it His own sacred metropolis, the only one He ever had localized on earth. 
    There His only Temple stood. There His holy laws were deposited. Thither His 
    people were required to come for the celebration of their most distinguished 
    services. There was the royal seat of His chosen kings. There was the sacred 
    capitol of His consecrated priests, of His inspired prophets, of His holy 
    scribes. There the glorious Messiah presented himself to the elect nation. 
    There he died for the sins of the world...And if the Great Pyramid belongs 
    at all to the great system of God's redemptive interpositions, it could hardly 
    be wanting in some reference to that 'City of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the earliest known times different 
    portions of the heavens have been designated, and known by certain figures 
    supposed to be outlined by the stars which they embrace. There are about eighty 
    of these constellations. The stars of which they are composed the Bible declares 
    to be for 'signs'`as well as for seasons, days, and years. The probability 
    is that the earlier and more remarkable designations were made by God Himself 
    even before the Flood. Josephus attributes the invention of the constellations 
    to the family of Seth, the son of Adam...Origen affirms that it was asserted 
    in the Book of Enoch that in the time of the patriarchs the constellations 
    were already divided and named. Volney informs us that everywhere in antiquity 
    there was a cherished tradition of an expected conquerer of the Serpent, and 
    asserts that this tradition is reflected in the constellations as well as 
    in all the heathen mythologies...It is impossible to doubt that astronomy 
    was invented from the beginning of the world; history, profane as well as 
    sacred, testifies to this truth...They suppose the originators to have lived 
    in about the Fortieth degree of North latitude </font>(or just above the site 
    of the ancient garden)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the oldest and most universal 
    of these costellations is The Dragon, or Great Serpent. The chief star in 
    that group (Draconis) is situated in the monster's tail. AND TO THAT STAR 
    THE ENTRANCE PASSAGE OF THE GREAT PYRAMID WAS LEVELLED. Draconis, then, looked 
    right down that inclined tube to the bottomless pit. Mankind marching down 
    that passage would therefore be moving under the sign and the dominion of 
    the Dragon, Hence the words of Ezekiel:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">They are delivered unto death, to the nether parts of 
      the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to 
      the pit...This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord God...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ezekiel 
      31:14-18).</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tokens that are now judgments 
    are laid to the line, and righteousness to the plummet, that every cover might 
    be lifted, and every refuge of lies be swept away...At the same time Draconis 
    will again be on the meridian beneath the pole, but then just Seven times 
    lower than at the time of the pyramid's building. This final downwardness 
    of Seven times is strikingly suggestive of the Dragon's complete dethronement. 
    And what is still more remarkable, while Draconis is on the meridian at this 
    low point, Aries, the Ram, appears on the meridian above, with the line passing 
    exactly through his horns. A more vivid astronomical sign of the overthrow 
    of Satan under the dominion of the Prince of the flock of God it is not possible 
    to conceive. It is as if the very heavens were proclaiming that then the everliving 
    Lamb takes to him his Great Power, and enters upon his glorious reign.&quot;
