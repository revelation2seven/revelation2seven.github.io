<blockquote> 
  <p>A letter to Jimmy Carter <br>
    Sean Gonsalves - Cape Cod Times </p>
  <p>Dear Mr. Carter: Let me begin with a belated congratulations on your being 
    awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. As you noted in your book, <i>Negotiation: 
    The Alternative to Hostility</i>, it&#146;s important to understand THAT PEACE 
    IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT JUSTICE. And justice is a two-way street, which means 
    that the &#147;war on terrorism&#148; should not be about just us. </p>
  <p>A STUDY OF THE JUST WAR TRADITION reveals that, though the criteria for it 
    varies slightly among scholars, there are SEVEN basic requirements that must 
    be met in order for a war to be considered just. </p>
  <p>A just war must: 1) have a just cause; 2) BE WAGED BY A LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY; 
    3) be formally declared; 4) be fought with peaceful intentions; 5) be used 
    as a last resort; 6) have a likelihood of success; and 7) use means proportionate 
    to the ends. I only have room in this space to briefly address three.</p>
  <p>A &#147;just war&#148; must have a just cause. It&#146;s extremely difficult, 
    especially with regards to Iraq, to show a clear cause. The idea that Saddam 
    is solely to blame (though he bears major responsibility and must be held 
    accountable) because he has violated international law is overly simplistic 
    and in some aspects is downright dishonest. We have allies that are in violation 
    of international law, including the unpleasant fact that Israel, with its 
    nukes, is in violation of resolution 687, which not only called for Iraq to 
    disarm but for the Middle East to be a &#147;weapons of mass destruction-free 
    zone.&#148; While ignored in most analysis, the rest of the world, particularly 
    the Muslim world, is acutely aware of this double-standard. </p>
  <p> A &#147;just war&#148; must be fought with a peaceful intention. If truth 
    and justice are inextricably linked to peace, then it&#146;s hard to swallow 
    the war-is-our-only-option view. For example, Saddam is repeatedly accused 
    of &#147;gassing his own people,&#148; a vague reference to the horrible atrocities 
    committed against the Kurds in 1988. But, not only did U.S. policymakers continue 
    to send Saddam&#146;s regime bio-chemical agents until 1989, according to 
    Patrick Tyler of the New York Times, our government provided intelligence 
    and planning assistance in chemical weapons attacks against Iranians during 
    the Iraq-Iran war in the 1980s. </p>
  <p>And even a year after reports began to surface in 1983 that Iraq was using 
    chemical weapons against Iran, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld hand-delivered 
    a letter to Saddam from President Reagan reestablishing diplomatic relations 
    with the &#147;beast of Baghdad&#148; in 1984. </p>
  <p>Anyone familiar with the violently fractious relationship between Saddam&#146;s 
    regime and Iraq&#146;s Kurdish population knows that phrases like &#147;Saddam 
    gassed his own people&#148; is like saying Andrew Jackson committed genocide 
    on his own people in his war against Native Americans. </p>
  <p>While there is a grain of truth to the charge, it&#146;s simply dishonest 
    to accuse a government of killing its &#147;own people&#148; when those people 
    are taking up arms to establish an autonomous region WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT'S 
    SOVEREIGN BORDERS. </p>
  <p>If some black paramilitary outfit in America were engaged in guerrilla warfare 
    to acquire territory in the United States, the government would mercilessly 
    crush the revolt with broad public support. And if some foreign superpower 
    was threatening to invade the United States, making the argument that the 
    president killed &#147;his own people,&#148; this misrepresentation of the 
    fact would be held up for ridicule by any thinking American. </p>
  <p>A &#147;just war&#148; must be a last resort. If democracy and the liberation 
    of the Iraqi people were truly the intention for the &#147;realist&#148; hawks, 
    then why isn&#146;t Troy Davis&#146; idea being discussed much more widely? 
    Davis proposes that we support a Constitutional Convention inviting legitimate 
    leaders of Iraqi opposition groups with real ties to the people inside Iraq 
    to set up a government-in-exile and let that body decide on what a post-Saddam 
    Iraq ought to be.</p>
  <p> Now, when the IRA was committing terrorist bombings in London, Western leaders 
    weren&#146;t calling for the bombing of Belfast or Boston where the IRA got 
    some of its financial support. And when the Oklahoma City bombing happened, 
    no one was calling for the bombing of Idaho and Montana where militia groups 
    have set up their &#147;safe havens.&#148; </p>
  <p>I&#146;m writing you to suggest a simple but extremely risky maneuver, Mr. 
    Carter. I&#146;d bet if you called up the pope and perhaps Muhammed Ali and 
    you all agreed to go to various parts of Iraq to serve as human shields, vowing 
    not to leave until a peaceful settlement can be reached, it would throw a 
    big monkey wrench in the unyielding Bush administration war plans. </p>
  <p>Me? I would go. But if I got blown to smithereens, besides my family and 
    loved ones, no one would care. In fact, some readers of this column would 
    undoubtedly cheer. </p>
  <p>Thank you for your prayerful consideration. Time is running out. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">JUST WAR--OR A JUST WAR</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">By Jimmy Carter</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>New York Times| Op-Ed, Sunday 08 March 2003 </p>
  <p>ATLANTA -- Profound changes have been taking place in American foreign policy, 
    reversing consistent bipartisan commitments that for more than two centuries 
    have earned <i>our nation greatness</i>. These commitments have been predicated 
    <i>on basic religious principles</i>, <i>respect for international law</i>, 
    <i>and alliances</i> that resulted in wise decisions and mutual restraint. 
    Our apparent determination to launch a war against Iraq, without international 
    support, is a violation of these premises. </p>
  <p>AS A CHRISTIAN AND AS A PRESIDENT who was severely provoked by international 
    crises, I became thoroughly familiar with the principles of a just war, and 
    it is clear that a substantially unilateral attack on Iraq does not meet these 
    standards. This is an almost universal conviction of religious leaders, with 
    the most notable exception of a few spokesmen of the Southern Baptist Convention 
    who are greatly influenced by their commitment to Israel based on eschatological, 
    or final days, theology. </p>
  <p>For a war to be just, it must meet several clearly defined criteria. </p>
  <p>THE WAR CAN BE WAGED ONLY AS A LAST RESORT, WITH ALL NONVIOLENT OPTIONS EXHAUSTED. 
    In the case of Iraq, it is obvious that clear alternatives to war exist. These 
    options -- previously proposed by our own leaders and approved by the United 
    Nations -- were outlined again by the Security Council on Friday. But now, 
    with OUR OWN NATIONAL SECURITY not directly threatened and despite the overwhelming 
    opposition of most people and governments in the world, the United States 
    seems determined to carry out military and diplomatic action that is almost 
    unprecedented in the history of civilized nations. The first stage of our 
    widely publicized war plan is to launch 3,000 bombs and missiles on a relatively 
    defenseless Iraqi population within the first few hours of an invasion, with 
    the purpose of so damaging and demoralizing the people that they will change 
    their obnoxious leader, who will most likely be hidden and safe during the 
    bombardment. </p>
  <p>The war's weapons must discriminate between combatants and noncombatants. 
    Extensive aerial bombardment, even with precise accuracy, inevitably results 
    in &quot;collateral damage.&quot; Gen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of American 
    forces in the Persian Gulf, has expressed concern about many of the military 
    targets being near hospitals, schools, mosques and private homes. </p>
  <p>Its violence must be proportional to the injury we have suffered. Despite 
    Saddam Hussein's other serious crimes, American efforts to tie Iraq to the 
    9/11 terrorist attacks have been unconvincing. </p>
  <p>The attackers must have legitimate authority sanctioned by the society they 
    profess to represent. The unanimous vote of approval in the Security Council 
    to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction can still be honored, but 
    our announced goals are now to achieve regime change and to establish a Pax 
    Americana in the region, perhaps occupying the ethnically divided country 
    for as long as a decade. For these objectives, we do not have international 
    authority. Other members of the Security Council have so far resisted the 
    enormous economic and political influence that is being exerted from Washington, 
    and we are faced with the possibility of either a failure to get the necessary 
    votes or else a veto from Russia, France and China. Although Turkey may still 
    be enticed into helping us by enormous financial rewards and partial future 
    control of the Kurds and oil in northern Iraq, its democratic Parliament has 
    at least added its voice to the worldwide expressions of concern. </p>
  <p>The peace it establishes must be a clear improvement over what exists. Although 
    there are visions of peace and democracy in Iraq, it is quite possible that 
    the aftermath of a military invasion will destabilize the region and prompt 
    terrorists to further jeopardize our security at home. Also, by defying overwhelming 
    world opposition, the United States will undermine THE UNITED NATIONS AS A 
    VIABLE INSTITUTION FOR WORLD PEACE. </p>
  <p>What about America's world standing if we don't go to war after such a great 
    deployment of military forces in the region? The heartfelt sympathy and friendship 
    offered to America after the 9/11 attacks, even from formerly antagonistic 
    regimes, has been largely dissipated; increasingly unilateral and domineering 
    policies have brought international trust in our country to its lowest level 
    in memory. American stature will surely decline further if we launch a war 
    in clear defiance of the United Nations. But to use the presence and threat 
    of our military power to force Iraq's compliance with all United Nations resolutions 
    -- with war as a final option -- will enhance our status as a champion of 
    peace and justice.</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DEAR JIMMY CARTER: 
  FROM DAVID PODVIN</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear President Carter,</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the weekend, you were quoted 
    in the Columbus Ledger-Inquirer as saying, &quot;I have the greatest personal 
    respect for President George W. Bush, and also understand the difficulties 
    and challenges of a new president.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You made this comment several days 
    after you were quoted in the same newspaper criticizing Bush for his position 
    on missile defense, Alaskan oil drilling, and global warming. It had been 
    gratifying, however briefly, to hear you speak the truth about this corrupt 
    prostitute for Big Business. That makes it even more infuriating to see you 
    now gutlessly back down.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you say that you have the 
    &quot;greatest personal respect&quot; for Bush, is this deadpan satire? Or 
    do you literally mean that your respect for him is unsurpassed by your respect 
    for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr? Dr. King risked his life to guarantee that 
    African Americans would have the right to vote and to have their votes count. 
    The man for whom you have &quot;the greatest personal respect&quot; deliberately 
    prevented many black Floridians from exercising those rights...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you respect him because he lied 
    about his tax cut for the rich, and because Republicans now plan to raid Social 
    Security and Medicare in order to have the elderly subsidize that immoral 
    giveaway? Do you respect him because he lied about an &quot;energy crisis,&quot;and 
    helped Kenneth Lay and the Texas Natural Gas Mafia steal billions of dollars 
    from defenseless consumers?...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You criticized Bush for his slavishly 
    corporate policies regarding missile defense, oil drilling and global warming. 
    Certainly a graduate of Annapolis is bright enough to see the common denominator 
    in his positions is the desire to screw over the average citizen in order 
    to enrich Republican campaign contributors. Do you respect him in spite of 
    that, or because of that.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush has appointed devotees of 
    the Confederacy to his cabinet. Did this increase or decrease your respect 
    for him? He has made an all out assault on the environment. He lied about 
    carbon emissions. He decided in favor of arsenic in the drinking water&gt; 
    He has okayed dumping of more industrial toxins into America's potable water 
    supply. All the while, he has deceitfully called himself an &quot;avid environmentalist.&quot; 
    He pledged to &quot;leave no child behind,&quot; then ruthlessly slashed funding 
    for pediatric hospitals, day care facilities, reading programs, and child 
    abuse prevention centers. President Carter, what does someone have to do in 
    order to lose your &quot;greatest personal respect?&quot;...</font></p>
