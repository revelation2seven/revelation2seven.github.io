  <p>PROLOGUE<br>
    The Legacy </p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p align="center">BEGINNING</p>
<p> This book shows how most of the ancient Israelites were exiled and lost their 
  identity and that today their descendants are to be found mainly amongst the 
  &quot;Gentile&quot; peoples of North America, Northwest Europe, Australia, New 
  Zealand, and South Africa. The present day Jews in the Diaspora and Israel are 
  mainly descended from only two of the original twelve tribes whereas the offspring 
  of the remaining majority are in the above areas.<br>
</p>
<p>Not only are the ancient Israelites proven in general to have migrated to the 
  west where their children formed eventually the nations of Great Britain, Eire, 
  France, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the 
  USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. But also individual Israelite 
  Tribes are specifically identifiable as historical groups (such as the Angles, 
  Jutes, Franks, etc.) who settled in definite areas. Different segments of each 
  tribe tended to congregate together in the same places so that their descendants 
  are now concentrated each in its own country which thus belongs to whatever 
  specific tribe gained predominance within its boundaries.<br>
</p>
<p>It will be demonstrated how from the Tribes of Joseph (Ephraim and Menasseh) 
  the present day English-speaking nations were formed. The Tribe of Reuben became 
  dominant amongst the French, Benjamin became the Belgae, Zebulon forefathered 
  the Dutch, Dan the Danes, Naphtali the Norwegians, and Gad the Swedes. The Fins 
  of Finland came from Issachar, Simeon, and Gad; Asher gave rise to the Scots, 
  Issachar to the Swiss, and so on. Some elements from each Tribe also mixed in 
  with those of other tribes. Clan appellations amongst the Israelite Tribes are 
  seen to have often been preserved by the Israelites in their places of exile 
  and throughout the course of their wanderings. Their descendants are therefore 
  often identifiable today according to the same names.<br>
</p>
<p>These claims are not far-fetched. They are supported by Biblical, Historical, 
  and other evidence. Much of our proofs are, in effect, even recognized by the 
  academic world, which simply has not sufficiently co-related the information 
  in its possession and not drawn the necessary conclusions from evidence it already 
  acknowledges. It is not being said that ALL the peoples in the discussed nations 
  are of Israelite descent. It is, HOWEVER, being stated that the overwhelming 
  majority of the Lost Ten Tribes are in those very areas, that they significantly 
  influence national characteristics, and that their numbers must be substantial 
  <br>
  possibly in some cases forming a majority of the population.</p>
<p>Similar claims regarding the Israelite origin of the British and others have 
  been made in the past though the evidence presented herein is more far reaching, 
  better substantiated, and more conclusive and convincing than anything advanced 
  heretofore. Some attempt has been made to present the case objectively though 
  it should be realized that both the personal disposition of the <br>
  present author as well as the nature of the account do not permit the extensive 
  consideration of every contradictory opinion. This work is largely a collection 
  of facts, each of which has been checked, cross-referenced, and evaluated in 
  its own right. Be that as it may, the account given within relies on the sum 
  of related data every piece of which needs to be considered as part of the whole 
  body of evidence. Every proof adduced reinforces the overall picture and is 
  in turn itself further confirmed by the total context.<br>
</p>
<p>Many of the conclusions reached, though sometimes seemingly obvious, are in 
  effect potentially revolutionary in their implications. It is hoped, therefore, 
  that the present exposition will receive the appreciation it deserves without 
  individual qualms or prejudices being allowed to blur the import of the book 
  or its real significance. The goal of this work was primarily a study which 
  it was hoped would lead to a deeper and more widely spread understanding of 
  Israelite Tribal Identities in the light of Biblical and Historical truth. This 
  book helps clarify the truth of the Bible. Reading the Bible and studying its 
  content is what we all need to do today, more than ever before. Not only is 
  this obligation vital to us now, it is also not difficult. With a little effort 
  and perseverance Bible study becomes enjoyable and gives life to its adherents. 
  The Tribes provides information concerning the identity of that <br>
  people which the Bible primarily speaks about and who on the whole are still 
  unaware of their Israelite and Tribal Identity.<br>
</p>
<p>It is hoped that at least some amongst the peoples identified within the following 
  pages as descendants of Israelite Tribes will gain a deeper appreciation of 
  themselves as they now are and of whom their ancestors may well have been. The 
  account contained within bears a far-reaching message concerning the modern-day 
  power struggle, Biblical prophecy and outlook, and the personal appreciation 
  many people should have for themselves. It should be known that the Jewish people 
  are their Tribal-brother &quot;Israelites&quot;. This work is also important 
  to the Jewish people in equal measure as it is to those identified as descended 
  from the <br>
  Lost Ten Tribes.</p>
<p>THE HEBREW EXILES IN EUROPE AND BRITAIN<br>
</p>
<p>The Blessings of Abraham...According to the Bible, Abraham was chosen to be 
  the forefather of a nation through whom all the families of the earth would 
  be blessed (Genesis 12; 2), who would keep the way of the LORD to do justice 
  and judgment (Genesis 18; 19), and who would themselves become numerous, great, 
  mighty, and blessed (Genesis 22;16-19). The blessings, in effect, were made 
  unconditionally (&quot;By myself have I sworn, says the LORD&quot;, Genesis 
  22; 16) and may be considered more as a means to achieve, rather than an effect 
  of the ordained national role. Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob who 
  was renamed &quot;Israel&quot; (Genesis 32; 28) who had twelve sons and these 
  became the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>The Peoples of Israel Split into Two Separate Kingdoms Under kings Saul, David, 
  and Solomon the twelve tribes were united in one kingdom which, at various stages, 
  controlled a significant portion of the Middle East. King David, from the Tribe 
  of Judah, established the capital at Jerusalem within which his son Solomon 
  built the Temple. In the reign of King Rehoboam, son of Solomon, ten of the 
  northern most tribes seceded and formed their own kingdom (1-Kings 12; 20-23), 
  which was referred to as &quot;Israel&quot;, (e.g. Hosea 5; 5). The remaining 
  tribes who remained faithful to the House of David were called &quot;Judah&quot;. 
  From <br>
  inhabitants of the Kingdom of &quot;Judah&quot; are descended the modern Jews, 
  though many individuals from the northern seceding tribes also made their way 
  south (e.g. 2-Chronicles 15; 9). In the course of time, these too became part 
  of the Jewish nation.</p>
<p>All Inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom Are Exiled...In approximately 740-720 
  BCE the Northern Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrians and all of 
  its people were exiled (2-Kings 17; 18). Sennacherib, the king of Assyria1, 
  also exiled more than 200,000 people from the kingdom of Judah which number, 
  at that stage, must have accounted for a good portion of the total Judean population. 
  It follows that those Israelites exiled by the Assyrians included many from 
  Judah. Those in Judah however, who were not exiled, numbered many from the northern 
  tribes who had made their way south previously. Even so, it is conventionally 
  accepted to name those exiles taken away by the Assyrians &quot;The Lost Ten 
  Tribes&quot; after the original body who broke away from Judah. The Lost Ten 
  Tribes were destined to lose their identity. The exile appears to have been 
  complete. There are no definite archaeological remains pertaining to Israelites 
  in the northern &quot;Israel&quot; area2 and dating from <br>
  after the Assyrian exile. Some later traditions indicate that a small percentage 
  did remain and these either joined their brothers in &quot;Judah&quot; or else 
  amalgamated with the &quot;Samaritans&quot; who were foreigners settled by the 
  Assyrians in place of the evacuees (2-Kings 17; 24)3. Nevertheless, the overwhelming 
  majority of Israelites had been taken away to places named in the Bible, in 
  Talmudic literature, and other sources, to locations wherein Israelite presence 
  is confirmed by archaeological evidence and from popular legend. It will be 
  shown that the exiled Israelites are identifiable, very often, in their places 
  of exile by the very same Tribal and Clan names they must have had before their 
  exile, and that they were destined to continue <br>
  to play an important role in human history.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What Happened To the Exiles?</p>
<p> The Israelites had been exiled because they worshipped other gods and followed 
  pagan customs (2-Kings 17; 7-23). In their places of exile the Israelites were 
  to continue on the whole their idolatrous practices and adoption of foreign 
  ways. Despite their imitation, throughout the ages, of the peoples surrounding 
  them, the Hebrew nature of the exiles was to reassert itself from time to time 
  and this enabled the realization of their inherited mission to tame and humanize 
  the pagan world. The present book, here and there, analyses this mission and 
  discusses prophecies concerning its fulfillment, though the major emphasis will 
  be on historical proofs identifying the historical and modern-day offspring 
  of the Lost Ten Tribes. This will be done. This will ber done by generally connecting 
  peoples with the exiles. Not only are specific peoples identified with the exiles 
  in general but also they are directly identified as members of Israelite Tribal-clans 
  within the Israelite Nation! The Israelites were transported en-masse partially 
  by ship to Spain and the west and from there they moved to Gaul and the British 
  Isles but mainly <br>
  they were sent to areas in northern Mesopotamia and to Hara. From those regions 
  they later moved northward into &quot;Scythia&quot; (roughly the area encompassed 
  in the past by the USSR) whence they migrated in several waves to the extreme 
  north and west of Europe from which their descendants settled North America, 
  Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The peoples in these said nations 
  today are thus in the Biblical and historical sense brothers of the Jews who 
  came from the remaining southern kingdom of Judah and comprised the second half 
  of the Hebrew nation with the Lost Ten Tribes comprising the remainder. The 
  Jews and the Lost Ten Tribes together form the Israelite or HEBREW nation.</p>
<p>Who Are The Hebrews?<br>
</p>
<p>The word &quot;HEBREW&quot; is a transliteration of the Hebrew word &quot;Ibri&quot;, 
  or &quot;Ivri&quot; and has been understood as meaning &quot;descendant of Eber&quot; 
  or &quot;someone from over the river Euphrates&quot; though in Scripture the 
  name is allocated only to Israelites (Iben Ezra on Exodus 21;2). The name &quot;IBRI&quot; 
  may be literally understood also as meaning simply &quot;outsider&quot; and 
  is derived from the root &quot;aver&quot; or &quot;over&quot; (which, in both 
  English and Hebrew connotes &quot;above and beyond&quot;3. The first Hebrew 
  in the Scriptural sense was Abraham the Hebrew. A Midrash (Genesis Rabah 42) 
  says that: All the world stood on one side while Abraham the Patriarch stood 
  over on the other. Abraham was the forefather of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. 
  Ten of these Twelve Tribes disappeared and were lost. Part of the Lost Ten Tribes 
  gave rise to peoples who moved from the Middle east to Spain and from there 
  to France, Holland, Ireland, and Britain. They called themselves &quot;Hiberi&quot; 
  or Hebrews and received Celtic culture. They were joined by other Israelites 
  who advanced overland and had also received aspects of &quot;Celtic&quot; civilization 
  or that of the Northern &quot;Germanic&quot; peoples. Out of the original twelve 
  tribes only two remained in the Land of Israel to be historically identified. 
  These remaining two tribes absorbed some refugees and migrants from the other 
  Tribes and together they became the Jews of history. The Jews were named after 
  &quot;Judah&quot; who was the dominant tribes amongst them. The Jews were exiled 
  from their land and suffered persecution <br>
  and unjustified hostility for more than two thousand years but at least they 
  retained knowledge of their identity..</p>
<p>What Happened To the Land of Israel?<br>
</p>
<p>The Land of Israel (&quot;Palestine&quot;) passed from Roman hands into that 
  of the Byzantines, thence the Persians took control, followed by the Arabs, 
  the European Crusaders, again the Arabs and finally the Turks.</p>
<p>Zionism Being Israel's Restoration Was Also A British Movement!<br>
</p>
<p>English, French, and Jewish thinkers beginning from the 1600's began (sometimes 
  independently of each other) to advocate the establishment anew of a Jewish 
  State in the Land of Israel. In Britain this line of thought was known as Restorationism 
  and it was paralleled amongst the Jews by Zionism. In the late 1800's the Jewish 
  Zionist movement was formed to work for the formal reconstitution of a Jewish 
  National Presence in Israel. At the same time Jewish settlement in the Land 
  increased <br>
  significantly. The Turkish rulers of Palestine and the local Arabs were essentially 
  hostile to this movement but the British used their influence and became the 
  semi-official protectors of the Jewish presence. The British also made periodical 
  attempts to alleviate the conditions of the Jews in Continental Eastern Europe 
  where they were severely persecuted. The long apparent British ambition to found 
  a Jewish State within the area of ancient Israel has been described by Franz 
  Kobler: &quot;Nowhere more than in Britain has the idea of the Restoration of 
  the Jews been developed into a doctrine and become the object of a movement 
  extending over more than three centuries. Only in Britain the leading spokesmen 
  of many generations have been inspired by the vision of a <br>
  revived Israel. Only there the creation of a Jewish National Home has been a 
  serious and almost continuous political issue which was finally translated into 
  reality.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>&quot; The idea of Israel's Restoration is rooted in the fundamentals of the 
  Commonwealth, Inseparable. from the character and history of the British nation 
  in spite of a temporary abandonment...&quot; &quot;The movement [i.e. Restoration 
  of the Jewish Independent Kingdom] [is].. an integral part of British religious, 
  social and political history forming a parallel, not an annex, of the histories 
  of Jewish Messianism and Zionism .... The recognition of Israel's Restoration 
  as an organic part of British political ideas.... [is] .. a genuine religious, 
  humanitarian and political trend within British history.&quot; Franz Kobler, 
  &quot;THE VISION WAS THERE&quot;, UK 1956 pp.7-9.</p>
<p>In 1914 the Turks joined the Germans and Austrians and fought against Britain 
  and her allies in the First World War. With the impending defeat of Germany 
  and Turkey the question arose as to the fate, after the war, of the non-Turkish 
  states in the Turkish Empire, including that of the &quot;Palestine&quot; area.</p>
<p>British Ambivalence...In 1917 the Government of Great Britain issued the Balfour 
  Declaration which declared the purpose of establishing a Jewish State in the 
  areas of modern day Jordan and Israel. Henceforth the British and Jewish Zionists 
  began to lay the foundations for Jewish Restoration. Despite several attempts 
  by the British establishment to renege on their undertaking, it was the British 
  who supplied the infrastructure and much of the economic base for the coming 
  state of Israel, This continued almost to the very last minute of British presence 
  in the area. On the other hand it was British arms, training and citizens who 
  helped the Arabs in their attempt to destroy this very entity. From the beginning, 
  the British administration had suffered from an ambivalent attitude and in the 
  1930's the anti-Jewish tendency appeared to have gained an upper hand. At the 
  same time as the British under Arab pressure restricted Jewish immigration to 
  &quot;Palestine&quot; there were pogroms in eastern Europe in which Jews were 
  robbed, beaten, tortured, raped, and murdered. Hitler came to power in Germany 
  and many Jews made desperate attempts to escape from Europe. The British due 
  to Arab pressure limited immigration to &quot;Palestine&quot;.</p>
<p>Traitors within France...It should be noted that before the Holocaust in Europe 
  many Jews had desperately been attempting to escape. Most of these attempts 
  were successful even though Jewish refugees were not welcomed in many countries. 
  With the outbreak of War the Germans conquered regions that contained Jewish 
  citizens and refugees and these were murdered by the Nazis. France had accepted 
  more Jewish refugees from Germany than any other country. Britain also received 
  a large number. France was defeated but before capitulating the French Army 
  gallantly protected the British forces who were miraculously enabled to escape 
  at Dunkirk. France however was riddled with right-wing pro-German anti-Jewish 
  elements. It was the enemies of the Jews of France herself who betrayed France 
  from within. Hitler had reactionary elements in France working on his behalf. 
  These formed the basis of the Vichy Government in southern France that co-operated 
  with the Germans. To some degree ethnic divisions may be distinguished between 
  those Frenchmen who willingly submitted to Hitler and those who did not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Attitude of the Peoples to the Holocaust... Britain (more than the USA, 
  Canada, and Australia) had accepted a good number of Jewish refugees but then 
  decided to drastically reduce admission. Economic reasons, as well as anti-Semitism 
  or the fear of arousing it, were among the reasons for these restrictions. Open 
  or concealed hatred of the Jews was often a motivating factor all over the world 
  in denying the Jews refuge. Every country on earth closed its doors against 
  Jewish refugees. This policy continued during the Second World War to a degree. 
  Some of the officials responsible knew that the results of this policy meant 
  death for those of Jewish descent and some were not so aware. Despite all this 
  it is doubtful if anything really could have been done on a large scale other 
  than defeat the Germans which is what was done. Claims to the contrary appear 
  to be illusionary departures from the reality as it then was.<br>
</p>
<p>Claims against the Allies include the following: 1. They did not accept Jewish 
  refugees before the War. 2. They did not bomb Auschwitz and the camps. 3. They 
  did not warn the Germans that atrocities would be punished. 4. They did not 
  &quot;barter&quot; Jewish lives for goods when the Germans offered to do so 
  towards the end of the War. 5. They closed the doors to Palestine. Some of these 
  claims have something in them and some do not. Concerning (1) they were not 
  aware that the Germans were about to conquer Europe and kill all the Jews they 
  could find. Perhaps they should have been but they were not and neither was 
  anybody else. Jewish refugees from Germany usually managed to find refuge in 
  other countries and those who went to places that the Germans later conquered 
  were killed but no-one foresaw this eventuality at the time. 2. Bombing Auschwitz 
  and the camps (if indeed it was possible) underestimates the determination of 
  the Germans to kill Jews.<br>
</p>
<p>3. Warnings not to harm the Jews were in fact issued in some cases but it was 
  also feared that their results could be counter productive. In Hungary Roosevelt 
  threatened to bomb Budapest if the persecution of the Jews did not cease and 
  the threat was effective. Wallenstein of Sweden and Lotz of Switzerland in Hungary 
  saved numerous Jews and they were acting on behalf of the USA in coordination 
  with their own governments. 4. There was no real possibility of &quot;bartering&quot; 
  Jewish lives for goods. Suggestions to the contrary by the Nazis appear to have 
  been part of a German trick to sow discord between the Allies and Russia who 
  already suspected the Allies of wanting to see Russia broken. Hitler would never 
  have allowed it. The Germans were killing Jews even at great expense to their 
  own war efforts. 5. The British restricted Jewish entry to Palestine because 
  they feared Arab reactions. Jews who illegally attempted to reach Palestine 
  were either allowed to stay or interned on Cyprus. A different policy could 
  have saved more Jewish lives but how many is uncertain and those responsible 
  were not necessarily aware of this possibility at the time. The measure of hostility 
  towards the Jews from other peoples at that time is not appreciated. At the 
  beginning of the War Turkey had instituted anti-Jewish measures but the USA 
  pressured her to desist from them. Spain was neutral and accepted a large number 
  of refugees but at one stage considered handing them over to Germany. A thinly 
  veiled threat from Churchill caused the Spanish to think again. Things were 
  done. It may not have been enough but it was something <br>
  and it was done by those who themselves were fighting for their own existence. 
  Things were done and they were done mainly by the Western Allies whom we believe 
  to constitute the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. In the cases of not-totally Axis-dominated 
  nations such as Hungary, Turkey, and Spain the Allies did exert effective pressure 
  on behalf of the Jewish people. The Germans and Austrians had began the SECOND 
  WORLD WAR and conquered most of continental Europe. They proceeded to exterminate 
  the Jewish people, men, women, and children. They were helped to murder Jews 
  by Ukrainians, <br>
  Latvians, Lithuanians, Romanians, Croatians, and others. More than six million 
  Jews were killed. In Poland some people rescued Jews, though the anti-German 
  Polish resistance movements themselves frequently also murdered Jews fleeing 
  from the Germans. This was done as a matter of policy and in some cases had 
  priority over the struggle against Germany. After the War <br>
  Poles who had helped rescue Jews often had to keep it secret lest their fellow 
  citizens murder them or their kin4. This was not the case in Germany. The consistency 
  of the German attitude was not always a conscious one. Nevertheless most Germans 
  to some degree accepted the Nazi aims. In the Bulgarian parts of Bulgaria-proper 
  the Jews were protected though the Jews of Bulgarian-Macedonia were handed over 
  to Germany for extermination. <br>
</p>
<p>In Western Europe the Danes, Belgians, Dutch, and French, at great risk to 
  themselves, often helped Jews escape or gave them shelter, though in some of 
  these countries the Germans had helpers in murdering the Jewish people. The 
  Italians often quite heroically helped save Jews yet had allied themselves to 
  Hitler and worked for a Nazi victory. </p>
<p>The British Saved Mankind and Delivered the Jews from Destruction!<br>
</p>
<p>The British remained unconquered and the only determined unbeaten opponent 
  of the Germans, from the beginning of the War until its end, was Great Britain 
  and Her Dominions. At one stage Britain (and her &quot;daughter&quot; Dominions) 
  stood alone against the victorious conquering Germans. The British could have 
  made a separate peace on favorable terms with Germany but even if the British 
  Government had wanted to (and it did not) the British people would not accept 
  anything less than continued struggle for complete victory. The anti-Jewish 
  policies of the Nazis even from before the beginning of the War was the major 
  single factor in turning British public opinion against Germany5. The USA actively 
  supported Britain on the material level turning itself into one vast hinterland-producing 
  area for the British effort. The USA and Russia after being attacked joined 
  Britain against Germany. Ultimately Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South 
  Africa, and Canada, together with the USA and USSR, defeated Germany and the 
  German allies, Italy, Croatia, Hungary, Rumania, and the Baltic States. Despite 
  everything, those Jews who did survive owe their lives, in a sense, to the Allies' 
  victory.</p>
<p>The Betrayal of the Jews...Both before the War and during it, it may have been 
  possible to save the lives of a very large number of Jewish refugees if there 
  had been somewhere to settle them. France, Britain and the USA received many 
  and most other places very little. Even Britain and the USA did not receive 
  as many as they could have. Australia and South Africa closed their doors. After 
  the WAR these same places (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the USA, Britain, 
  etc.) were often enthusiastic (and at other times at least willing) in re-settling 
  millions of non-Jewish refugees and immigrants from Russia, the Ukraine, Latvia, 
  Lithuania, Hungary, Germany, Italy, Pakistan, Africa, Asia, and so on. From 
  reading accounts and official reports concerning the fate of the Jews during 
  the Holocaust years when the Jews needed to be helped an unmistakable impression 
  is received. Some of the authorities in potential host countries would rather 
  have left the Jews to their fate than help them, especially if help meant accepting 
  them into their own countries. This was despite the fact that the economies 
  and societies of the prospective host countries would have benefited6. Jews 
  were not welcome (to say the least) under any circumstance. This throws a serious 
  question on the degree of Israelite ancestry claimable by the said nations. 
  It does not nullify such claims but it means that they must be qualified and 
  the presence of non-Israelite elements existing alongside the Israelite ones 
  seriously taken into consideration! On the other hand some <br>
  genuine attempts were made to help Jews fleeing from certain death. Some effective 
  policies were undertaken which were nearly always due to people identified in 
  this work as coming from &quot;Lost Ten Tribes&quot; Israelite stock. <br>
</p>
<p>In France people of Protestant Huguenot descent were especially active in doing 
  all that they could to rescue Jews. The fact that the WAR against the Nazi evil 
  was fought, maintained, and eventually won was also due mainly to people identified 
  by us as descended from Israelites. Despite everything, one aspect of the whole 
  War effort had the goal to ensure Jewish survival.</p>
<p>The German Plan to Exterminate Britain. Traitors To Britain Were Anti-Jewish!</p>
<p>The Germans found the Dutch too pro-Jewish and not sufficiently &quot;Aryan&quot; 
  in outlook. They intended to deport all of them to Poland which would be depopulated 
  of its Polish inhabitants. In the Second World War they had attempted to conquer 
  Britain. They had plans, if successful, to deport all of the male population 
  as slave labor to the Continent: Females (if they survived) would be fertilized 
  by SS men. Professor Dr. Franz Six was to be in charge of Britain. He later 
  indoctrinated the Killing Squads (Einsatzgruppen SS) in Russia. &quot;Hitler 
  agreed with every word; his great respect for the Anglo-Saxon race had made 
  it all the harder for him to enter this life-or-death struggle which must end 
  with the destruction of one of them.&quot; (Peter Townsend, &quot;Duel of Eagles&quot;, 
  1971, p.45). Compare Payne, Robert &quot;The Life &amp; Death of Adolf Hitler&quot; 
  U.S.A. 1973, p.400: &quot;...Among the many plans submitted to Hitler and approved 
  by him was a comprehensive plan for transporting the greater part of the male 
  population to work in factories in Germany. Orders concerning the Organization 
  and Function of the Military Government of England, a thick compendium of rules 
  and regulations to be followed by the German administrators of the conquered 
  territory, called for all able bodied men between the ages of seventeen and 
  forty-five to be sent to Germany as slave-laborers. The women of England, with 
  the help of the SS, would produce a new race of Anglo-Germans. The entire intelligentsia 
  and all the Jews would be liquidated. SS Colonel Professor Dr. Franz Six, a 
  former dean of the faculty of political science at the University of Berlin, 
  was placed in charge of the liquidation and deportation of Englishmen. SS offices 
  would be established in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool., Manchester, 
  and Edinburgh. Colonies of Englishmen would be established in the Baltic States&quot;. 
  The above documented plan only represents part of the actual eventuality. The 
  plan was that set out for the best of circumstances from the German point of 
  view. It reflects German susceptibilities prior to action. Hitler considered 
  England &quot;the enemy above all enemies&quot; (Payne p.343). The fate of the 
  English in practice was liable to have been even worse than the plan indicates.</p>
<p>I am sure that Hitler would not have hesitated for a moment to employ atom 
  bombs against England. I remember his reaction to the final scene of a newsreel 
  on the bombing of Warsaw in the autumn of 1939...Hitler was fascinated. The 
  film ended with a montage showing a plane diving toward the outlines of the 
  British Isles. A burst of flames followed and the island flew into the air in 
  tatters. Hitler's enthusiasm was unbounded. &quot;This is what will happen to 
  them!&quot; he cried out, carried away. &quot;That is how we will annihilate 
  them!&quot;&gt;&gt; Albert Speer, &quot;Inside The Third Reich&quot;, New York, 
  1971, p.303.</p>
<p>The Germans may have meant to exterminate the British people as we know it. 
  They were developing means of mass-sterilization. Even so, there existed fringe 
  elements within certain sections of British society who had appeasing tendencies 
  towards the Nazis both during the War and after it. It was these same &quot;conciliatory&quot; 
  elements in many cases who later strengthened the anti-Jewish sentiments expressed 
  in official policy regarding Palestine. To sum up: The whole world east of the 
  Rhine actively participated in the extermination of the Jews. The British and 
  Americans were against it and did what they could to prevent it but there were 
  elements amongst them that strongly did not want &quot;too many&quot; Jews in 
  their own country or in &quot;Palestine,&quot; or elsewhere. There were also 
  elements who were anti-Semitic outright. These were a minority but had influence 
  at crucial moments. Elements who were anti-Jewish were often in effect proven 
  to be traitorous to the Allied cause.<br>
</p>
<p>After the War the Jews in Palestine, reinforced by survivors from the European 
  &quot;concentration&quot; (murdering) camps were faced with a coalition of hostile 
  Arab forces partly backed, armed and trained by the British and including the 
  presence of British military personnel. Fiction between the Jews and British 
  had been growing due to the British restricting Jewish immigration to Palestine 
  (including that of those who had no-were else to go), and not allowing the Jews 
  to defend themselves against Arab <br>
  terrorism. In addition anti-Semitic elements in the local British Palestinian 
  administration and in the British Government had increased in influence.</p>
<p>Why Did Britain Renege?...The British attitude in Palestine resulted from a 
  mixture of anti-Semitism in certain circles together with a misplaced colonial 
  tradition of protecting the &quot;natives&quot;. The results of this characteristic 
  had already been seen elsewhere: British concern for the Red Indians in North 
  America at the expense of the British descended white settlers was one of the 
  causes of the American War of Independence against the British. In South Africa, 
  British protection of the &quot;blacks&quot; discriminated against Dutch Boer 
  and British settlers. In New Zealand, British policy had favored Maori natives 
  over immigrants from Britain8. In Palestine the British often attempted to be 
  impartial but suffered from a conflict of interests. Prior to the Second World 
  War, a British officer (Orde Wingate) under directions from the British Army 
  helped found the Jewish Fighting Forces and formulate military concepts that 
  ultimately led to Jewish victory. Orde Wingate, incidentally, believed in the 
  Bible, realized that the British descend from the Lost Ten Tribes9 and dreamt 
  of leading an independent Jewish Army. He was transferred against his will from 
  &quot;Palestine&quot; and in the Second World War liberated Ethiopia from the 
  Italians. Later in Burma he caused the Japanese to divert their forces and thus 
  probably ensured the Allied victory against the Japanese. In &quot;Palestine&quot;, 
  in addition to Orde Wingate, many of the British personnel were pro-Jewish in 
  practice.&uml; At one stage the British had actually executed hundreds of Arab 
  rebels and otherwise disposed of many more. The British position was never really 
  clear, even to themselves, and both Arabs and Jews felt discriminated against. 
  There were also many British soldiers and administrators who openly sided with 
  the Arabs and were anti Semitic. In British Governmental circles men such as 
  Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were strongly pro-Jewish and Zionistic but 
  they were restrained and hampered by their colleagues and by people in lower 
  echelons. The British Administration in Palestine was at times openly anti-Semitic. 
  Despite this, on the whole, the Jews benefited from the British presence. Even 
  though some Britons worked against it most of the British public (in Britain) 
  continually favored the establishment of a Jewish state! It was a succession 
  of British Governments who let their own people down as well as the Jews. The 
  British had ruled in Palestine where <br>
  Jews and Arabs were fighting each other. Both resisted the British until the 
  British decided to leave. Newly-released documentation suggests that the British 
  Labour Government envisaged an Arab victory over the Jews which would result 
  in the British being called back to serve as &quot;Protectors&quot; of a truncated 
  Jewish entity centered on Haifa10. Pro-Jewish (or just fair-minded) elements 
  however amongst the British forces evacuating Palestine helped the Jews save 
  themselves from the defeat they were intended to suffer .<br>
</p>
<p>After the establishment of the State of Israel Winston Churchill in the House 
  of Commons stated that the anti-Jewish policies of some British Governments 
  had been mistaken and called for Reconciliation11. For the sake of perspective 
  it should be recalled that the British feared Communist expansion and that the 
  Jewish international consensus regarding Communism was at first unclear. Jews 
  on the Continent had been horribly oppressed and persecuted. In Russia many 
  Jews had been forced by the authorities to abandon their religion. Some had 
  found refuge in Revolutionary movements. These were a small percentage of the 
  Jewish people but for the Revolutionaries they were qualitatively important. 
  A minority of Communists was Jewish even though the Communists were mortal enemies 
  of the Jewish people. Some few Jews were thus initially conspicuous amongst 
  Communist sympathizers and Communism was then a serious threat. Even more Jews 
  at that time had Socialist and extreme liberal sympathies and these were identified 
  as potentially &quot;Communist&quot;. </p>
<p>The &quot;Communist menace&quot; was regarded with hysteria in certain circles. 
  The British also had oil interests, numerous Moslem subjects in India and Malaya 
  and other areas, and there were other considerations. A parallel case in some 
  respects is that of South Africa, and how many liberal Anglo-Saxon Gentiles 
  and Jewish intellectuals supported the South African whites in the past even 
  though the whites may have been objectively relatively more justified than any 
  other group in prevailing circumstances? The South African whites were forced 
  to place their very existence in danger mainly due to pressure from their liberal 
  Anglo-Saxon and Jewish brothers. It should also be remembered that Anti-religious 
  Jews in and outside of Israel and including members of some of the Israeli Governments 
  have on occasion been almost as anti-Jewish as some of the British sometimes 
  were. [The Olso Agreements of 1993 and everything that sprang from them are 
  an example. These Agreements gave weapons and a power base within the Land of 
  Israel to Arab murderers whose declared intention was to kill as many Jews as 
  possible. These Agreements were sanctioned without any justification by numerous 
  leaders in the Jewish community.] It is also worth highlighting some of the 
  positive pro-Jewish aspects the British Administration in Palestine did have 
  when an overall view is taken:<br>
</p>
<p>The British kept their promises to the Zionists. They opened up the country 
  to mass Jewish immigration; by 1948, the Jewish population had increased by 
  more than tenfold. The Jews were permitted to purchase land, develop agriculture, 
  and establish industries and banks. The British allowed them to set up hundreds 
  of new settlements, including several towns. They created a school system and 
  an army; they had a political leadership and elected institutions; and with 
  the help of all these they in the end defeated the Arabs, all under British 
  sponsorship, all in the wake of that promise of 1917. Contrary to the widely 
  held belief of Britain's pro-Arabism, British actions considerably favored the 
  Zionist enterprise. Tom Segev, &quot;One Palestine Complete&quot;, USA, 2001, 
  p.5<br>
</p>
<p>The British had found an underdeveloped country when they arrived, and they 
  left behind much progress, especially among the Jews. But they also left behind 
  much backwardness, especially among the Arabs.&gt;&gt; Segev, p.9. Pollock [a 
  British military administrator in Palestine] and others like him wanted the 
  state administration to continue to function properly, and so they did in fact 
  make a great effort to transfer it to the Jews. Some functions were handed over 
  to the municipalities, others to the Jewish Agency. In addition, the evacuation 
  plan, from south to north, left responsibility for Jewish population centers 
  in British hands, almost to the very last minute, thus impeding Arab war plans. 
  Segev, p.513.</p>
<p></p>
<p>THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND NON-JEWISH &quot;ISRAELITE&quot; SUPPORT<br>
</p>
<p>At all events, despite the attacks of hostile Arab states, the Jews won their 
  War of Independence and the State of Israel came into existence in 1948. President 
  Truman insisted that Israel be allowed to retain the Negev area thus doubling 
  the size of the new country. For a limited time after its inception the State 
  of Israel enjoyed the aid of individual Frenchmen and the general support of 
  France. Britain remained ambivalent, though in 1956 Britain, France, and Israel 
  were allied in military action against Egypt. At that stage the USA was antagonistic. 
  In 1967 Israel fought a war against the Arab States surrounding her and was 
  victorious. After 1967 the USA became Israel's main (and almost only) backer 
  and also materially supported her. President John Kennedy told Golda Meir that 
  the relationship between the USA and Israel was comparable to that between the 
  USA and Britain. President Nixon was a genuine friend of Israel and so were 
  most other American leaders such as President Reagan and President George Bush 
  . Millions of Jews had been imprisoned in eastern Europe, Ethiopia, and the 
  USSR and it was largely due to US influence and often active intervention that 
  many of these were enabled to emigrate to Israel and elsewhere. The USA did, 
  however, have its own anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist elements and these, on occasion, 
  did damage to the Israeli cause, or at least tried to. The USA at times openly 
  used its overwhelming influence to attempt the manipulation of Israeli society 
  and government. The establishment of left-wing governments in the State of Israel 
  and forced agreements that enabled the Palestinian Arabs to arm themselves and 
  seriously endangered Israel was due to American and European interference in 
  Israeli affairs. On the other hand Israel received much support from Fundamental 
  &quot;Evangelicals&quot; in the USA and elsewhere. Throughout the <br>
  Western World and especially the English-speaking areas Christians have recently 
  began to search for their &quot;Hebrew&quot; roots. The more Biblically orientated 
  they are the more this phenomenon occurs and it is usually accompanied by increasing 
  sympathy for and support of the Jewish State of Israel. </p>
<p>By &quot;Hebrew&quot; roots the Christians intend the sources of their religious 
  faith but we would say that an inner arousal of their ancestral Hebraic sources 
  is also a factor. A very large proportion of those who have supported and helped 
  the Jews and the State of Israel were descended from Israelites as proven in 
  this work. Often those few friends whom the Jews had were both of Israelite 
  origin and also believed strongly in the Bible. In the USA this phenomenon was 
  and is especially noticeable. There were also occasions when the USA seemed 
  to regard Israel almost as an expression of part of itself and act accordingly 
  though at other times Israel was treated with barely-subdued hostility.<br>
</p>
<p>On the whole it may be said that since the eighteenth century (and to an extent 
  well before) most countries of the world were anti Jewish while the USA, Britain, 
  and France, and related nations in Western Europe and overseas were ambivalent 
  with a favorable attitude prevailing more often than not. This book brings proof 
  that part of the reason for this &quot;Ambivalence&quot; was HEREDITY. There 
  is a familial relationship between western peoples and the Jews which at times 
  is instinctively felt and expressed. The Lost Ten Tribes having migrated westward 
  is the best factual explanation of this feeling.</p>
<p></p>
<p> INHERITANCE</p>
<p> A significant and influential portion of the peoples in northwest Europe, 
  Britain, and North America have the same ancestry as the Jews. This fact has 
  influenced the historical behavior of the said peoples. It is generally accepted 
  that these peoples have always been attached to the Bible, especially to the 
  &quot;Old&quot; (Hebrew) Testament. On the whole their overall national tendency 
  has been a striving for the general good and justice for all. It is obvious 
  that these goals have not been achieved but attempts have been made and for 
  that matter no claim is being made that all of these peoples are Hebrew or that 
  Hebrew ancestry is always good. A specific influence is being considered as 
  attributable mainly to the contribution of definite groups who, to some degree, 
  probably merged with others of possibly opposing inclinations.</p>
<p>The Promise to Abraham-A Prerequisite for Greatness...Abraham was the first 
  ancestor of the Hebrew nation and of him it was stated: &quot;Abraham shall 
  become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be 
  blessed in him... he will command his children and his household after him, 
  and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the 
  LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him&quot; (Genesis 
  18;17-19). This blessing infers that becoming &quot;a great and mighty nation&quot; 
  was not only an effect but also a PREREQUISITE of having all the nations of 
  the earth being blessed in him and of doing justice and judgment. Similar verses 
  in the Bible expound on this theme and add detail to it. We will return to this 
  subject. The doing of justice was to be especially associated with the Tribe 
  of Joseph.</p>
<p>Colonialism Was Beneficial...The nations identified in this book as being of 
  the Israelite seed of Abraham were those who mainly conducted European colonialist 
  policies from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries. The overall effects of 
  colonialism, in most cases, were very beneficial -despite claims to the contrary. 
  French, British, and Dutch colonialism put a stop to internecine warfare, ended 
  human sacrifice and slavery, founded and/or improved irrigation-systems, reformed 
  agricultural practices and public hygiene, built bridges, roads, public works, 
  and so on. Wherever they ruled the local population greatly increased in numbers, 
  in health, and in respect for basic human dignity. The colonial powers also 
  often (but not always) made large profits for their own citizens and helped 
  themselves by exploiting opportunities for investment, which the subject countries 
  offered. This investment usually benefited all parties. This was part of the 
  blessing of Abraham, the power was given and it was used for good, even though 
  in some cases the initial conscious motivation in colonization was a lust for 
  power and material gain. In the case of the British, colonies often accrued 
  to the Empire due to dynamics beyond the conscious control of the British themselves! 
  The overall effect of colonization was beneficial, and altruistic motives were 
  also present and implemented. Even today these peoples remain the only real 
  morally motivated advancers of international justice in this world. Even if 
  this morality is often misapplied or self serving or strangely selective there 
  does exist a genuine will to do the right thing overall and on the whole the 
  effects are positive.\</p>
<p></p>
<p>We Are Not Racists!</p>
<p> Another point is that the above statements and the historical material revealed 
  in this book are not coming to support any racialist or other theories. All 
  of mankind is descended from one ancestor. The characteristics of everyone else 
  are potentially present somewhere in each of us! The peculiar behavior of any 
  group may, in part, be attributed to the effects of climate, environment, geographical 
  location, historical factors, and cultural influences, all of which are largely 
  beyond the control of whoever is affected by them. NEVERTHELESS, for whatever 
  reason, a promise was made to Abraham which was unconditional and which had 
  therefore, at some time, to occur; and to some extent so it has -in the above 
  mentioned nations. Whatever caused this occurrence in the immediate sense is 
  relatively inconsequential. The historical proofs in this book, thus, have potential 
  significance beyond that of academic study. The said evidence may be of importance 
  in helping many peoples understand both their own past and their present obligation 
  and potential. An important message of this book involves the ancestry of many 
  people in the western world today for whom the historical study indicates Israelite 
  ancestral identities and these entail both hereditary characteristics and obligations.</p>
<p>The exiles from the Northern Kingdom were taken in part overseas to Spain and 
  its region and from there they moved to Ireland, Britain, and Gaul. Others were 
  taken to the fringes of the Assyrian Empire, in northern Mesopotamia, the Caucasus 
  and Zagros Mountain areas and eastern Iran. From these regions they were to 
  move into Europe and Eurasia and eventually converge on the west in the process 
  adopting aspects of &quot;Celtic&quot; and &quot;Germanic&quot; civilization. 
  They had been transferred at the first en-masse from the LAND OF ISRAEL. In 
  Israel they had been part of a Twelve Tribed Nation, each tribe being divided 
  into smaller familial groupings and sub-clans. The Assyrian directed relocation 
  of these &quot;Israelites&quot; was accompanied by the partial breaking up and 
  scattering of the Tribal units. Nevertheless, enough of the original organizational 
  patterns were to be maintained in the places of exile to enable the identification 
  of historical groups with Israelite entities and to trace their subsequent movements.<br>
</p>
<p>The identifiable Israelite descended peoples were destined to reach and settle 
  in West Europe, where too, the same Tribal and Tribal clan equations are possible. 
  What exact percentage of Israelite parentage exists in the relevant nations 
  wherein these groups settled is uncertain but it appears to be substantial. 
  At all events, wherever else parts of the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel may or may 
  not be, their overwhelming majority migrated to the above mentioned areas, as 
  the following pages show.</p>
