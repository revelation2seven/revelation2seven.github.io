<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Two centuries of independence, 
    two hundred years of national awareness, these are the underlying themes of 
    countless festivities now in progress or planned throughout fifty American 
    states. The world at large pauses a moment to reflect upon the prodigy that 
    grew from the thirteen rebellious colonies when George III lost his American 
    domains.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But wait a bit. There is more to 
    America's past than appears upon the surface. A strange unrest is apparent 
    among many of the younger historians and archaeologists of the colleges and 
    universities, a sense that somehow a very large slice of America's past has 
    mysteriously vanished from our public records. For how else can we explain 
    the ever-swelling tally of puzzling ancient inscriptions now being reported 
    from nearly all parts of the United States, Canada, and Latin America?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The inscriptions are written in 
    various European and Mediterranean languages in alphabets that date from 2,500 
    years ago, and speak not only of visits by ancient ships, but also of permanent 
    colonies of Celts, Basques, Libyans, and even Egyptians. They occur on buried 
    temples, on tablets, and on gravestones and on cliff faces. From some of them 
    we infer that the colonists intermarried with the Amerindians, and so their 
    descendants still live here today.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was once a time when such 
    finds were attributed to the misguided folly of uprooted colonists from Europe, 
    to forgers or cranks fabricating tradition for a society that has none. But 
    skepticism changed to bewilderment when it was discovered that American inscriptions, 
    some of them known for a century or more, turn out to have been written in 
    ancient scripts only recently deciphered in Europe or North Africa. Thus the 
    truth has slowly come to light, ancient history is inscribed upon the bedrock 
    and buried stone buildings of America, and the only hands that could have 
    inscribed it were those of ancient people. America, as we now realize, is 
    a treasure house of records of man's achievement upon the high seas in bygone 
    ages...&quot; </font>America B.C. (Druids in Vermont. Phoenicians in Iowa

    in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to determine whether the American 
    Indians were the lost tribes of Judah; and it was pretty well proved both 
    yes and no, and unprovable either way, which made it an excellent topic for 
    study and exploitation, one populated by warm bodies and tear stained faces 
    and beautiful, waiting children. James Adair, an Irish trader who lived among 
    the Cherokees for forty years, decided the Indians were indeed one of the 
    lost tribes and wrote seventy thousand words on the subject at a time when 
    printed words were dear. He used as evidence such topics as their division 
    into tribes; their language and dialects, their festivals, feasts, and religious 
    rites, their absolutions and anointings, their laws of uncleanness, their 
    avoidance of unclean things, their practices of marriage, divorce, and punishment

  had to do with a set of sacred instructions that passed among the tribes and

  who would come back to this land (a <i>second-wave</i> people), who would work 
  much evil in the earth through the use of such devices and bring destruction 
  upon itself again through its own inventions. These instructions flowed from

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is much confusion concerning 
    Quetzalcoatl, and many scholars argue about the identity or even the existence 
    of such a figure. The modern Mayan esotericist, Hunbatz Men, in his book, 
    &quot;Secrets of Mayan Science/Religion,&quot; has some useful information 
    on the similarities of esoteric Mayan Science with the sciences of ancient 
    India. </font>(Of course, this was part of Christianity's mission in the earth, 
    to provide the bridge between the East and West, linking all of the dimensions 
    of the Sacred World Tree to each other)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    He points out that the Mayas used the same chakra system as the Hindus, and 
    even many of the words are the same. He also points out that the &quot;Naga 
    Maya&quot; held many of the priestly secrets of the Maya. James Churchward 
    of the popular &quot;Mu&quot; books likewise considered the &quot;Nagas&quot; 
    as the source of Hindu wisdom.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hunbatz Men also shows that Mayan 
    glyphs, words and concepts had different levels of meaning, much as ancient 
    Egyptian and Hebrew had different levels of meaning in their inscriptions 
    and books, and the level of initiation of the reader determined the knowledge 
    that was gained from any text.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, Hunbatz Men maintains that 
    Quetzalcoatl , or Kukulcan in Mayan, is not meant to be a real person, but 
    essentially the embodiment of a perfected man, a yogi, adept, or Master in 
    eastern terminology, or a saint or Master in western terminology. He maintains 
    that &quot;Self-appointed 'official' historians have created the great colonial 
    lie of a 'whiter, bearded, and blue-eyed' Quetzacoatl--a deception still perpetrated 
    in histories of our beloved Mexican people. The true nature of Quetzalcoatl/Kukulcan 
    remains a mystery that is accessible only through Nahua/Mayan science/religion. 
    </font>(Such an idea very admirably reflects Paul's doctrine of the Universal 
    Christ--the Christ that dwells in every man)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The true nature, according to Hunbatz 
    Men, is that we are all Quetzalcoatl, and that the perfect being inside of 
    us can be reached through the correct use of yoga (meditation). While Hunbatz 
    Men may be correct in that we all have the capability of perfecting ourselves 
    and becoming Quetzalcoatl, a sort of god on earth, he is most definitely incorrect 
    when he says that the notion of a bearded man walking throughout Mesoamerica 
    is a fabrication of Spanish historians. He seems to forget that the very conquest 
    of Mexico itself would never have happened if Cortez had not been believed 
    by the Aztecs to be this mysterious bearded stranger returning to them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When in 1519, Cortez and his 600 
    companions landed in Mexico they were astonished at being hailed as the realization 
    of an ancient native tradition, which was generally told as follows: Many 
    centuries previously a white man came to Mexico from across the sea in a boat 
    with wings (sails) like those of the Spanish vessels. He stayed many years, 
    traveled all over North America and taught the people a system of religion, 
    instructed them in the principles of government, and imparted to them a knowledge 
    of many industrial arts. He won their esteem and veneration by his piety, 
    his many virtues, his wisdom and his knowledge of divine things...</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">That the God of our Lord (Hesus Crishna), the Father of 
    glory (the Great Spirit), may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation 
    in the knowledge of him...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ephesians 1:17-23).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The Mexicans knew him as Quetzalcoatl, 
    or THE FEATHERED SERPENT. The quetzal is a rare bird in the forests of Central 
    America whose long feathers were more valuable than gold to the ancient Mesoamericans. 
    After some twenty years (?) of visiting the various civilizations of North 
    America, Quetzalcoatl eventually left the country. On his way to the coast 
    he stayed for a time at the city of Cholula, where subsequently a great pyramid 
    surmounted by a temple was erected in his honor. On the shores of the gulf 
    of Mexico (the island of Cozumel it is often said) he took leave of his followers, 
    soothing their sorrow at his departure with the assurance that he would not 
    forget them, and that he himself, or someone sent by him, would return at 
    some future time to visit them. He had made for himself a vessel of serpent's 
    skins, and in this strange contrivance he sailed away in a northeasterly direction 
    for his own country the holy island of Hapallan, lying beyond the great ocean....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, it was predicted that 
    Quetzalcoatl would return on a one reed (Ce-actl) year. The one reed year 
    reoccurred every 52 years, and 1519 was such a year </font>(as was the year 
    of the Harmonic Convergance that was celebrated at many sacred places across 
    the American continent in 1987)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The religion of the Mexicans as 
    the Spaniards found it was in truth an amazing and most unnatural combination 
    of what appeared to be Christian beliefs and Christian virtues and morality 
    with the bloody rites and idolatrous practices of pagan barbarians. The mystery 
    was soon explained...by the Mexicans themselves. The milder part of the Mexican 
    religion was that which Quetzalcoatl had taught them...And then the first 
    bands of Aztecs eventually appeared. They were wanderers from the Northwest...and 
    were a fierce and warlike people, possessing little capacity for the mental 
    and moral refinement and high civilization of their Toltec predecessors...All 
    that was savage and barbarous in the religion rites...was attributed by the 
    Mexicans themselves to the Aztecs; all that was gentle and humanizing to the 
    Toltecs...To the Toltec origin was assigned those doctrines and practices 
    which struck the Spaniards as remnants of an early knowledge of Christianity...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Whether due to such teaching 
    or to accidental coincidence, it is certain that the Mexicans held many points 
    of belief in common with Christians. They believed in the Trinity </font>(three 
    descents on the limbs of the Sacred Tree)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    the Incarnation, and apparently the Redemption. One of the first things that 
    struck the Spaniards on their arrival in Mexico was the spectacle of LARGE 
    STONE CROSSES on the coast and in the interior of the country. These were 
    objects of veneration and worship. One cross or marble near one of the places 
    the Spaniards named Vera Cruz was surmounted by a Golden Crown, and in answer 
    to the curious inquiries of the Spanish ecclesiastics the natives said that 
    'ONE MORE GLORIOUS THAN THE SUN HAD DIED UPON A CROSS...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whoever Quetzalcoatl may have been, 
    and whatever might be the right designation of the religion which he taught, 
    it is clear beyond question that he was the medium through which the Mexicans 
    obtained their curious Christian-like knowledge...He was the founder of history, 
    the law-giver, the inventor of calendar of days and years, the composer of 
    the 'Tonalmatl,' THE SUN BOOK, where the <i>Tonalpouhqui</i>, 'HE WHO COUNTS

<p><font size="+1">The fifty-two year cycle traces the transit of Venus--the <i>morning</i> 
  and <i>evening</i> star--across the heavens. This transit reflects in every 
  way the Westward journey of Jerusalem, <i>the City Above, the Mother of us all</i>. 
  (Galatians 4:26). The other, generally more familiar, method of counting the 
  times involves the idea of Jubilees, or sets of both 49 days and 49 years. The 
  method is laid down in Leviticus, chapters 23 and 25, as well as in the Hebrew 
  <i>Book of Jubilees</i> and in <i>The Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer the Great</i>. 
  We speak of it in detail in Chapter 5, and in those sub-chapters entitled The 
  Seventh Month and The Harmonic Convergance. Suffice it to say here that way 
  out there in the territory that is now known as Wyoming, on top of a most-sacred 
  site, there is an very ancient Stone Circle embedded in the earth, A MEDICINE 
  WHEEL, whose 28 spokes fit exactly the pattern of the great 28-year Solar Cycle 
  (one that conforms to, and catches up to its own Lunar and Jubilee cycles in 
  the fulness of time). It is believed by many that this Medicine Wheel forms 
  the basis of every Sun Dance ceremony that has been observed on this continent 
  ever since.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>Medicine Wheel, Bighorn County, Wyoming</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>The Medicine Wheel is located in the Bighorn National Forest on the western 
    peak of Medicine Mountain at an elevation of 9642 feet in the Bighorn Range 
    east of Lovell, Wyoming. The 75-foot diameter Medicine Wheel is a roughly 
    circular alignment of rocks and associated cairns enclosing 28 radial rows 
    of rock extending out from a central cairn. This feature is part of a much 
    larger complex of interrelated archeological sites and traditional use areas 
    that express 7000 years of Native American adaptation to and use of the alpine 
    landscape that surrounds Medicine Mountain. Numerous contemporary American 
    Indian traditional use areas and features, including ceremonial staging areas, 
    medicinal and ceremonial plant gathering areas, sweat lodge sites, altars, 
    offering locales and fasting (vision quest) enclosures, can be found nearby. 
    Ethnohistoric, ethnographic, and archeological evidence demonstrates that 
    the Medicine Wheel and the surrounding landscape constitute one of the most 
    important and well preserved ancient Native American sacred site complexes 
    in North America. The Bighorn Medicine Wheel is considered the type site for 
    medicine wheels in North America. Between 70 and 150 wheels have been identified 
    in South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Alberta, and Saskatchewan.</b></p>

  &amp; STARS</font></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can't see it as I did, the 
    night of the 1978 summer solstice, which was also the night of a full moon. 
    I spent that night alone on Medicine Mountain, Wyoming, at the Bighorn Medicine 
    Wheel. After many unexpected experiences during the night, I saw the expected 
    solstice sunrise line up with an old tree branch I'd placed with tobacco, 
    sage and cedar in the central cairn. Usually I have no voice and am no kind 
    of singer, but then I faced that rising sun, then suddenly stood up and sang 
    a song loud and joyful in a language that I think no one knows any more. (But 
    I knew what it meant while I was singing.) I never sang like that before, 
    never since.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can't do that (and I can't 
    again), because the U.S. Forest Service has developed it now as a tourist 
    attraction. There are now 30,000 visitors during the short summer period it 
    can be visited. Interpretive presentations are now given under Forest Service 
    sponsorship by people from nearby Crow and Cheyenne tribes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was white men (discovering it 
    at the end of the 19th century) who named it &quot;Medicine Wheel,&quot; terminology 
    they applied to anything Indian observed or told them they didn't understand. 
    White men of the Sheridan Chamber of Commerce -- particularly as tourism in 
    the Bighorn National Forest got underway as economically significant to the 
    town -- made a huge mystery of it, and ignored the fact that there are at 
    least 40 other wheels on the high plains (mostly in Canada), as well as some 
    sites far removed, both spatially and culturally. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of these (Cahokia in Ohio) 
    has been called &quot;An American Woodhenge&quot; because of similar astronomical 
    sightings from a large circle of postholes, all that remains. The &quot;-henge&quot; 
    and the interest of astronomers in solar, lunar and star sighting relationships, 
    comes from a 1960's analysis of the famous Stonehenge in England. In the late 
    1960's British astronomer G.S. Hawkins showed with astronomical computations 
    that the ancient circle of huge megaliths was a solar-lunar and stellar analog 
    computer made by pre-historic Celtic tribespeople. This gave Eddy, then an 
    astronomer (whose speciality was the sun) at the High Altitude Observatory 
    at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, near Boulder, Colorado, the 
    idea to make an exact survey of the Bighorn wheel, and observations and computations 
    following the methods used by Hawkins. To see if the rocks, the mountain, 
    sun, stars and the spatial directions could tell us something people have 
    long forgotten. He found that they could, that nature itself speaks to those 
    who know how to interpret, via astronomy, geometry, and mathematics. Generally, 
    the methods used -- at least until the excitement this discovery occasioned 
    -- are not known to anthros.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--Here -- on a Wyoming tourist 
    map -- is where the Bighorn wheel is, west of Sheridan, on Alt 14-A, which 
    used to be a poor 1-lane bulldozed into an old travois trail. You used to 
    have to hike about a mile to get to the Wheel, It's on a high, bare shoulder, 
    at about 10,000 feet, above the tree line, with almost a full horizon view 
    all around. There's a precipice not far behind the main sun-sighting altar 
    dropping to the Bighorn River valley. A steep bluff with some sharp drop-offs 
    slopes down to a lower ledge on part of the shoulder that's still above the 
    tree-line and overlooks the broad valley to the southeast. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--This color photo of the Bighorn 
    Wheel, was supplied by the U.S. Forest Service Bighorn district office is 
    taken (probably in the late 1970's) looking due east (there is a red east 
    marker at the edge of the windswept bare shoulder's stepped drop-off). Snow 
    is still visible on the distant ridges and forest below, but has been blown 
    clear of the shoulder here. The wheel is about 90 feet in diameter, though 
    it's not a perfect circle. The central cairn (solar backsight) is about 12 
    feet in diameter. It was about 4 feet tall when I visited it in 1978. The 
    sunrise sighting cairn is at the lower right from this photo angle, separated 
    from the wheel's rim by a 12 foot spoke extension. It is U-shaped, longer 
    than wide, and open at the end toward the circle's center. You can stand or 
    sit in this cairn -- I slept in it, lying stretched out in my sleeping bag, 
    then I sat up -- to sight the solstice rising sun along the spoke and through 
    an old dead branch I placed in the central cairn. Behind you will be a steep 
    precipice, down to the Bighorn River valley, across which there are visible 
    snowy summits of high peaks that bound Yellowstone National Park, 100 miles 
    away. On the front lower left of the wheel is the starsight cairn. Across 
    the rim, on its eastern side, are the cairns used as backsights for sighting 
    the dawn-rising stars Aldebaran, Rigel, and Sirius, as calculated and discovered 
    by astronomer John Eddy in 1972-4. At the right is a cairn that lines up with 
    dawn-rising of the southern bright star Fomalhaut, as discovered by Jack A. 
    Robinson, in 1980.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ancient geology of Medicine 
    Mountain has formed a very special place, perhaps unique in all the world. 
    Regardless of when the Wheel was built up there, there is every likelihood 
    it has always been sacred to Native peoples, because its special character, 
    an acient sacredness long predating the existence of humankind and even animals, 
    can be felt. That's probably why the Wheel was built there, actually.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tourist desecrations might have 
    been worse, probably would have been, except for years of determined protective 
    efforts by the Medicine Wheel Alliance, an organization that got its start 
    through the Northern Cheyenne Cultural Commission. In 1988, the Forest Service 
    made a developmental proposal for the wheel, which was protested by people 
    from Northern Cheyenne, Crow, Arapaho, Sioux, and Blackfeet tribes, who later 
    formed the protective organization. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anthros seem mainly to have asked 
    the Crow about the wheel (their reservation in Montana is nearest, and there 
    is a small, damaged wheel near Fort Smith on their present rez land), Northern 
    Cheyenne may know more about it. The Wheel figures in an unsuccessful treaty-based 
    land claim filed by the Northern Cheyenne in 1929, just inside (its shoulder 
    precipice forming part of) the boundary of land including the Bighorns and 
    Powder River country they maintained the U.S. took illegally). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Northern Cheyenne 
    Bill Tall Bull in 1988, &quot;I've had to hide myself up there (from the Forest 
    Service) while conducting ceremonial prayers on the mountain. Rangers have 
    been known to kick Indians off the mountain. Many times I had to hide from 
    them and the tourists while there for prayer.&quot;How sad, when I head this, 
    just 10 years after I was up there all alone, it wasn't famous then</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After my night alone up there seeing 
    the solstice sun rise right on the ancient altar's lineup I went to the home 
    of a traditional woman elder friend at the nearby Northern Cheyenne rez. No 
    one there could tell me much about it, then, except that &quot;It was up there 
    that the instructions were given for the first Sun Dance.&quot; The Wheel 
    itself was said to be those instructions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sundance lodge, with entrance to 
    east and 28 rafters for the 28 lunar cycle days. This, according to Lakota 
    elder Black Elk, was the original form of the Sundance lodge, which he says 
    was Cheyenne, though nowadays lodges may be made with fewer rafters. The diagram 
    from above is similar to the basic shape and orientation of the Bighorn Medicine 
    Wheel, which has 28 lunar day spokes from its central cairn. According to 
    Forgot name??? it's similar to a Cheyenne Sundance lodge created for a masama 
    ceremony.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They were having a Sun Dance at 
    the Northern Cheyenne rez -- I was invited to stay for it, and take part in 
    some of the preparations. This Sun Dance was being made by the father of a 
    young man who -- while drunk -- had killed another Cheyenne and received a 
    long prison sentence. He hoped it would help his son, but everyone knows it 
    helps all the people, as it renews the earth. Cheyenne Sundance Lodge Painting 
    by Wah-pah-nah-ya (Richard West, Northern Cheyenne), 1949</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1988, the Forest service wanted 
    to put a parking lot and latrines right next to the Wheel, with some kind 
    of interpretive center building, and a big platform overlooking the Wheel 
    itself. They were going to pave the rough road up there to improve access, 
    and take that road all the way to the site. (I had to hike in. That was part 
    of it.) In May, 1991, the Forest Service issued an Environmental Impact statement. 
    The Alliance responded &quot;There is no consideration of the Native American 
    in this document; it is designed for tourists.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was no plan to restrict tourist 
    access during ceremonies, although the Forest Service said they'd ask the 
    public to voluntarily stay away at solstice or equinox ceremonies. MWA coordinator 
    Nicol Price said that in the summer of 1991 such voluntary restraint was shown 
    to be quite futile, when curious tourists even snapped photos as Indian elders 
    tried to conduct ceremonies, Tall Bull, who was one of the leaders in the 
    many-year negotiations of the Alliance said &quot;The federal government has 
    no respect for our shrine, or the Indian people who regularly worship there.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some compromises have been made 
    -- the parking lot was built a mile or so away, they have to go that last 
    mile on a foot trail -- all 30 or 40 thousand of them. Indians lead the interpretive 
    presentations. Major structures the Forest Service wanted weren't built (the 
    latrines are at the parking lot). I'm glad of these things, but quite sorry 
    to hear of the many tourists who come, gawp, then go away. I am very glad 
    I followed whatever it was thatled me up there to that then-deserted place 
    20 years ago. I would not have wanted to &quot;attend a ceremony&quot; up 
    there that was being conducted by any peoples at all. Though I'd read a scientific 
    article about its use as a solar and astronomical &quot;analog computer&quot; 
    and written about this and other medicine wheels of the high northern plans 
    for Akwesasne Notes in 1974, I didn't know much about it when I drove 1,000 
    miles for that solstice, not even where it was, really. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--To start with, the Bighorn Wheel 
    is not unique. These stone structures -- observatory cairns or altars of stone, 
    circles, with some spokes -- seem to be located only on the front range high 
    plains area of the Rocky Mountains, and most of them are in Canada, Alberta 
    and Saskatchewan. The map shows some 28 of them that are still in fairly good 
    shape today. None are as high as the one on usually-inaccessible Medicine 
    Mountain, but all are on the highest point (usually in an area of rolling 
    hills), with a full observational horizon. On the map I've marked Medicine 
    Mountain's wheel in red, and another I'll discuss briefly, Moose Mountain, 
    in blue. That one (or maybe one even older) seems to be the original or prototype 
    of the star knowledge that went into building the Bighorn wheel's star sighting 
    cairns 1200 years or more later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Fort Smith, on the Crow reservation, 
    is a small wheel , whose longest, southwesterly spoke and central altar-cairn 
    form a sight on the summer solstice rising sun. West of Great Falls, Montana 
    is a wheel whose southerly spokes are partly destroyed by erosion from the 
    Sun River, but suggests a similar alignment. At the top of the Continental 
    Divide, near an old travois trail, on Trail Ridge Road in Colorado is a huge, 
    rough cairn with two long spokes that line up with summer solstice sunrise. 
    Not shown on the map, in Minnesota, on the open grassland prairie of Blue 
    Mounds state park there is a 1500-foot line of quartzite boulders which is 
    a northeasterly sighting line for solstice sunrise, though the Historical 
    Society mistakenly identifies it as equinoctial (which would be direct east-west; 
    many non-scientific people are confused about the words equinox and solstice). 
    Not far from it (not in the park) are the enigmatic Jeffers Petroglyphs -- 
    thousands of mysterious signs pecked into flat red rocks which may include 
    astronomical records.</font></p>
  <p>CREDITS: I redrew (from the 1980 cover of the Bulletin of Archaeoastronomy 
    and colored an artistic version of the wheel seen from just in front of the 
    sunsight altar just as the solstice sun has risen although the 3 speical stars 
    are not visible then, I placed them in the sky roughly where they could be 
    sighted from the starsight cairn. The black and white drawing of an eagle 
    spirit, Pipe, mountain, crescent moon and dipper stars was drawn in Indian 
    ink in 1978 by Tissonie, Johnny Creed Coe (Cherokee) who was art instructor 
    at Red School House AIM Survival School that fall. He gave it to me one evening 
    when we were both trapped there by a big blizzard, I told him it seemed emblematic 
    of the experience I'd had on Medicine Mountain that summer. The buffalo skull 
    centering the Bighorn Wheel is the logo of the Medicine Wheel Alliance, which 
    continues to work with tribal people to save sacred places from desecration. 
  </p>
  <p>Prints of the black and white photos of the Medicine Wheel were given to 
    me by a U.S. forest service secretary at the Bighorn National Forest office 
    in Lovell, Wyoming, on the day of the solstice, 1978, when I visited that 
    office before going up on the wheel for the night. It was apparently taken 
    by Roger M. Williams of the Forest Service from a low-flying plane, around 
    1972. I have re-oriented it so the directional alignment is correct. The side 
    view of the Wheel was also a black and whtie print th Forest Service gave 
    me in 1978. It was taken by an anthropologist in 1926, some time before the 
    Forest Service put up a high steel fence around the wheel, but after they 
    had built a low stone wall around it. The color photo of the wheel was recently 
    sent me by the Bighorn office of the forest Service, but seems to have been 
    taken some years ago, perhaps in the late '70's or early '80's; photographer 
    and date were not identified.</p>

    structure) is constructed in a large circular corral perhaps some hundred 
    feet in diameter, the circumference of which is lined on the outside with 
    branches of trees to give shade to the dancers. Each dancer has a certain 
    place in the dance hall which he must keep throughout the duration of the 
    dance when he enters it. Two small poles or young saplings of pine or cottonwood 
    are placed on each side of the dancer...If the dancer is a medicine man or 
    has been wounded in battle sometime he should show this on the poles by painting 
    them red, which signified his blood was lost in battle. The center pole which 
    should always be a cottonwood was chosen by the originators of the dance because 
    of its superiority over all other trees as a dry land tree growing with little 
    or no water. This tree represents God. The twelve long poles that are placed 
    from the top of the center pole down to the circumference of the dance hall 
    represent, according to our Indian beliefs, the twelve apostles of God, our 
    Father.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The eagle feathers at the top of 
    the poles above the center pole also represent the twelve apostles of our 
    Father, or God, and also being a sacred bird of our race, we Indians naturally 
    regard the eagle with the highest esteem. The buffalo head in the crotch in 
    the center pole represents a gift from God, our Father above, to his Indian 
    children for food and clothing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sun dance has been handed down 
    to my people for generations as a sacred dance in which we may pray to God 
    our Father, for those who may be sick, that they may be healed. In many cases, 
    I can truthfully state, many have been cured of long standing illnesses through 
    their faith in prayer and fasting from food and water for the duration of 
    the dance, which generally lasts three or four days. Many of our white brothers 
    have condemned my people's sacred dance, and their form of worship. This form 
    is, in the belief of my people, identical with that used by our white brothers 
    in their christian church and in the form which they consider just and proper.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My people, the Indians, worship 
    the same Being as that worshipped by our white brothers, but only in our own 
    way and in our beliefs, which I know is very strange to the white people. 
    But this is the only form of worship the red man, my people, have known for 
    generations past and is known throughout the Indian race as the Indians' church. 
    Every Indian tribe has its own form of worship which is somewhat different, 
    but I wish to explain that they all worship the same Being, God, our Father 
    above. I am told that many years ago some tribes of Indians used drastic forms 
    of worship in which they signified their bravery and fearlessness, but these 
    forms of worship have long since vanished. We hear of them only through Indian 
    tradition...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sun dance...is generally held 
    once a year, about June or July. This is the season when the grass and trees 
    are in their splendor and the weather is favorable. Before entering the sun 
    dance hall the worshippers, or dancers, twice circle the hall. The chief of 
    the sun dance, or the medicine man is always in the lead. This is done merely 
    according to our old Indian customs, which according to our Indian beliefs 
    signifies that the dancers are all ready and willing to begin their dance 
    or ceremony...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I shall state here that the term 
    <i>our Father</i> is used in place of God, as there is no Shoshone word which 
    signifies the word <i>God</i>. This word is an English word. Therefore, if 
    an Indian or interpreter must use this word he repeats the word <i>God</i> 
    in English and not in Indian. Never once have I heard the Indian tradition 
    where there was any religious controversy as to the true form of worship of 
    God or our Father. All Indians, so far as I have ever heard, believe and worship 
    in this one form. </font>Great Documents In American Indian History, by Wayne

    of glory would fade away, but the promise of it always remained, the promise

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later still I was traveling all 
    over the western part of the United States...I met a number of Indians on 
    this trip and told several the story of my dream. I asked them what it meant, 
    but, for a long time, none could tell me. Then one day, when I was driving 
    from Albuquerque to Snowflake, Arizona, I saw a tall young man on the road 
    ahead of me. He was not asking for a ride, but accepted one when I offered 
    it...He said he was mainly Otomi, of a tribe that lives in the mountains of 
    central Mexico, but part Olmec. When he heard my story of the strange dream, 
    his face suddenly shone with understanding:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I know what your dream means,&quot; 
    he cried. &quot;Long ago there lived a great prophet-king of the Toltec Indians 
    of southern Mexico called Quetzalcoatl, which means the 'Feathered Serpent.&quot; 
    Quetzalcoatl brought a message of love and kindness, teaching the people how 
    to make new things and to raise better crops, and making the Toltecs into 
    the greatest nation of Mexico. My grandmother told me that there was an ancient 
    story that, as Quetzalcoatl left the Toltecs to journey to a far place, he 
    prophesied what was going to happen to the Indians.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He foretold that in time 
    white men would come out of the eastern sea in great canoes with wings like 
    a big bird...He promised that the white men themselves would be like a bird 
    that had two different kinds of feet. One foot would be the foot of a dove 
    and the other the foot of an eagle. The foot of the dove meant the religion 
    of Christianity, which was brought by the white men, and which is a religion 
    of love and kindness, although too few of the white men lived by this religion. 
    The foot of the eagle meant the way most of the white men treated the Indians, 
    by clawing them, killing them, enslaving them and exploiting them.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The circle with the four O's and 
    cross within symbolizes the Four Corners Region (where Utah, Colorado, Arizona 
    and New Mexico meet). The circle represents no beginning and no end -- the 
    infinite Great Spirit. The Indians believe we are the Fourth World. When the 
    Third World was destroyed, those Indians who had listened to the prophets 
    were guided to places of safety underground. After the Fourth World was created, 
    they assembled at Four Corners and were instructed to spread out in the four 
    directions. Four (4) also represents the four elements in nature: fire, water, 
    air and earth; and the four color races of man: black, yellow, white, and 
    red.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Hopi Prophecy, a white man 
    would come to them and help transform the entire continent into a spiritual 
    paradise. He would be recognized because he would carry the fragment of stone 
    which would complete their Holy Stone, filled with Indian writing characters. 
    The Holy Stone had been preserved for thousands of years. Thus, when the white 
    settlers came to the American continent, remembering their prophecy, they 
    were openly welcomed. The Indians shared all they had. In return, all the 
    White Man did was to take. The Indians noticed that their White Brothers had 
    brought a cross. However, it was not enclosed by the circle of the Great Spirit, 
    thus showing the White Man had lost his way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Indians believe that at the 
    beginning of the Fourth World, when man was told to disburse throughout the 
    planet, from Four Corners, the White Race was one of the original races that 
    went East. Upon their return to our continent, they had become confused and 
    forgotten the ways of the Great Spirit. Further the prophecy continued, either 
    the White Man would bring peace and harmony or attempt to totally destroy 
    the Indians' way of life and take all their possessions and the land. If the 
    latter occurred, there would come a time when the Indian people would appear 
    to be almost nonexistent. Yet, one day, they would rise out of nowhere to 
    lead a spiritual revolution so that all people on this continent would become 
    attuned to the Great Spirit and to protect Four Corners at all costs because 
    there is great power under the land. If it is allowed to escape, great destruction 
    will result. Today, the Indians are going through the test to hold onto their 
    traditional ways and protect the land. The White Man's society is trying to 
    swallow the Indians up. Many Indians, especially the young, are falling prey 
    to the White Man's ways.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prophecy also talks about creation 
    of atomic bombs as catastrophes of great heat, equal to the heat of a sun. 
    It also warns about tampering with the moon (violating its nature by removing 
    rocks and soil).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another prophecy: Four Corners 
    will be the area of confrontation between White and Red. Indians will be pushed 
    into Four Corners. Great Spirit told the Hopi that Four Corners is the backbone 
    of what is now the United States. Hopi must hold this land till human beings 
    live in harmony. The power under the land would be used for destruction. There 
    would be a terrible punishment if we give up Four Corners. Hopi Elders also 
    know about the prophecies of earth changes and Space Brothers.<br>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>The arrival of Europeans on the east cost of North America occurred not 
    in 1620, but well before. French and Dutch fishermen and settlers had been 
    in the area as early as 1614, and had been responsible for kidnapping Indians, 
    selling them into slavery, and maliciously infecting them with smallpox. In 
    1620, the pilgrims arrived on the east coast and within two days they had 
    received assistance from the local Wampanoag Indian tribe: The pilgrims stole 
    their stored crops, dug up graves for dishes and pots, and took many native 
    people as prisoners and forced them to teach crop planting and survival techniques 
    to the colonists in their new environment. </b></p>
  <p><b>Luckily, for the colonists, an ex-slave named Squanto had recently escaped 
    slavery in England, spoke English fluently and was able to instruct the pilgrims 
    in crop planting, fishing, and hunting. Squanto not only escaped from slavery, 
    he was also one of the only survivors of his tribe, the rest had been wiped 
    out from the European smallpox plagues years before. When it came to helping 
    the rag-tag team of colonists, Squanto, not only was able to put aside his 
    personal differences with the people who had enslaved him and killed off his 
    entire tribe, but also helped make the colonists self-sufficient, and aided 
    in brokering a treaty with the Wampanoag tribe. In 1621 Massasoit, the chief 
    of the Wampanoags, signed a &quot;treaty of friendship&quot; giving the English 
    permission to occupy 12,000 acres of land. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>In 1621 the myth of thanksgiving was born. The colonists invited Massasoit, 
    chief of the Wampanoags, to their first feast as a follow up to their recent 
    land deal. Massasoit in turn invited 90 of his men, much to the chagrin of 
    the colonists. Two years later the English invited a number of tribes to a 
    feast &quot;symbolizing eternal friendship.&quot; The English offered food 
    and drink, and two hundred Indians dropped dead from unknown poison. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The first day of thanksgiving took place in 1637 amidst the war against 
    the Pequots. 700 men, women, and children of the Pequot tribe were gathered 
    for their annual green corn dance on what is now Groton, Connecticut. Dutch 
    and English mercenaries surrounded the camp and proceeded to shoot, stab, 
    butcher and burn alive all 700 people. The next day the Massachusetts Bay 
    Colony held a feast in celebration and the governor declared &quot;a day of 
    thanksgiving.&quot; In the ensuing madness of the Indian extermination, natives 
    were scalped, burned, mutilated and sold into slavery, and a feast was held 
    in celebration every time a successful massacre took place. The killing frenzy 
    got so bad that even the Churches of Manhattan announced a day of &quot;thanksgiving&quot; 
    to celebrate victory over the &quot;heathen savages,&quot; and many celebrated 
    by kicking the severed heads of Pequot people through the streets like soccer 
    balls. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The proclamation of 1676 announced the first national day of thanksgiving 
    with the onset of the Wampanoag war, the very people who helped the original 
    colonists survive on their arrival. Massasoit, the chief invited to eat with 
    the puritans in 1621, died in 1661. His son Metacomet, later to be known by 
    the English as King Phillip, originally honored the treaties made by his father 
    with the colonists, but after years of further encroachment and destruction 
    of the land, slave trade, and slaughter, Metacomet changed his mind. In 1675 
    &quot;King Phillip&quot; called upon all natives to unite to defend their 
    homelands from the English. For the next year the bloody conflict went on 
    non-stop, until Metacomet was captured, murdered, quartered, his hands were 
    cut off and sent to Boston, his head was impaled on a pike in the town square 
    of Plymouth for the next 25 years, and his nine-year-old son was shipped to 
    the Caribbean to be a slave for the rest of his life. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>On June 20, 1676 Edward Rawson was unanimously voted by the governing 
    council of Charlestown, Massachusetts, to proclaim June 29th as the first 
    day of thanksgiving. The proclamation reads in part: &quot;The Holy God having 
    by a long and Continual Series of his Afflictive dispensations in and by the 
    present War with the Heathen Natives of this land, written and brought to 
    pass bitter things against his own Covenant people in this wilderness, yet 
    so that we evidently discern that in the midst of his judgments he hath remembered 
    mercy&Ouml; The council has thought meet to appoint and set apart the 29th 
    day of this instant June, as a day of solemn Thanksgiving and praise to God 
    for such his Goodness and Favor&Ouml;&quot; <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>It was not until 1863 that Abe Lincoln, needing a wave of patriotism to 
    hold the country together, that Thanksgiving was nationally and officially 
    declared and set forth to this day. At the time, two days were announced as 
    days to give thanks, the first was a celebration of the victory at Gettysburg 
    on August 6th, and the second one became the Thursday in November that we 
    know now. The most interesting part of thanksgiving is the propaganda that 
    has been put out surrounding it. During the 19th century thanksgiving traditions 
    consisted of turkey and family reunions. Whenever popular art contained both 
    pilgrims and Indians, the scene was usually characterized by violent confrontations 
    between the two groups, not a multi-cultural/multi-racial dinner. In 1914 
    artist Jennie Brownscombe created the vision of thanksgiving that we see today: 
    community, religion, racial harmony and tolerance, after her notorious painting 
    reached wide circulation in Life magazine. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Adamant protests to the celebration of thanksgiving have taken place over 
    the years. As early as 1863 Pequot Indian Minister William Apess urged &quot;every 
    man of color&quot; to mourn the day of the landing, and bury Plymouth Rock 
    in protest. In 1970 Apess got his way. 1970 was the &quot;350th&quot; anniversary 
    of thanksgiving, and became the first proclaimed national day of mourning 
    for American Indians. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>State officials of Massachusetts asked Frank B. James, President of the 
    federated Eastern Indian League, to speak at the thanksgiving celebration. 
    The speech he submitted read: &quot;Today is a time of celebrating for you, 
    but it is not a time of celebrating for me. It is with heavy heart that I 
    look back upon what happened to my people. The pilgrims had hardly explored 
    the shores of Cape Cod before they had robbed the graves of my ancestors, 
    and stolen their corn, wheat, and beans&Ouml; Massasoit, the great leader 
    of the Wampanoag, knew these facts; yet he and his people welcomed and befriended 
    the settlers, little knowing that before 50 years were to pass, the Wampanoags 
    and other Indians living near the settlers would be killed by their guns or 
    dead from diseases that we caught from them. Although our way of life is almost 
    gone and our language is almost extinct, we the Wampanoags still walk the 
    lands of Massachusetts. What has happened cannot be changed, but today we 
    work toward a better America, a more Indian America where people and nature 
    once again are important.&quot; James was subsequently barred from speaking.</b></p>
  <p><b> As a result, hundreds of people from around the country came to support 
    him by gathering around the statue of Massasoit that had been erected in town. 
    The protesters buried Plymouth Rock twice that day. For the next 24 years, 
    American Indians staged protest every thanksgiving, in 1996 the United American 
    Indians of New England put a stop to the annual pilgrim parade and forced 
    the marchers to turn around and head back toward the seaside (symbolism?). 
    In 1997 the peaceful protestors were assaulted by members of the Plymouth 
    police, the county sheriffs department, and state troopers on horseback in 
    full riot gear. Men, women, children, and elders were beaten, pepper sprayed 
    and gassed. Twenty-Five people were arrested; blacks, whites, latinos, Indians, 
    and even a 67-year-old Penobscot elder were taken to jail. Videotape was later 
    produced to confirm the assault and ensuing police brutality. Plymouth is 
    known as &quot;Americas Hometown.&quot; <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Finally in 1999 plaques were approved and dedicated to commemorate &quot;genocide&quot; 
    and other crimes against indigenous peoples of the Americas. The plaque at 
    Coles Hill, where the statue of Massasoit is reads: &quot;Native Americans 
    do not celebrate the arrival of the pilgrims and other European settlers. 
    To them, thanksgiving day is a reminder of the genocide of millions of their 
    people, the theft of their lands, and the relentless assault on their culture.&quot; 
    The second plaque in the towns post office square honors &quot;King Phillip&quot;, 
    Massasoits son. </b></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">from the Codex Vindobonensis</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The birth of the founders 
    of the Mixtec people, metaphorically the original human beings, from a Tree 
    at Apoala is depicted in the pre-Hispanic Mixtec Codex Vindobonensis. The 
    codex of the Mixtecs, in addition to being a remarkable work of art, provide 
    an almost unique sense of the scope of the mythic-historic vision of the people 
    of Mesoamerica, retelling Mixtec history from its primordial beginnings. Claiming 
    descent from (Quetzalcoatle) the Feathered Serpent (the one who came from 
    across the Ocean). The Mixtecs, who by 1350 A.D. occupied an area of southern 
    Mexico that now comprises the western section of the state of Oaxaca and the 
    adjacent regions of Puebla and Guerrero, believed that their founding fathers 
    were born from trees, both a metaphoric reference to their close ties to the 
    land and to their cosmic relationship to the world axis, since the World Tree 
    stands in the center of the cosmos uniting the lower, middle and upper worlds 
    and thus also suggests the continuing nature of the process of creation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following the detailed interpretation 
    of this image, we see a Tree with a cleft in its crown (at the top of the 
    trunk) from which emerges a nude male covered with red body paint. A nude 
    female stands above him (above the Tree, a symbol of the unification of the 
    one to the other). On either side of the Tree (standing near the base), identified 
    by their signs, appear 7 Rain on the right, holding a cutting implement in 
    his right hand while touching the Tree with his left, and 7 Eagle on the left 
    side, holding a clawed instrument in one hand and similarly touching the Tree 
    with his other. They seem to be cutting into the trunk of the Tree, </font>(exposing 
    its inner meanings)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...At the base 
    of the Tree (Malkhuth) there is a female head with an extended tongue, a fang 
    in the corner of her mouth, and long hair </font>(a symbol of Life)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    with what appears to be red &quot;bangs,&quot; both probably generative signs, 
    the color suggesting one of the possible colors of Corn. Together with the 
    male figure at the top of the Tree, this female figure at the base indicates 
    the male-female (Father-Mother) nature of the Birth Tree, a metaphor similar 
    to the male-female nature of the creator God, Ometeotl...The body of the Tree 
    itself is swollen, indicating perhaps that the offspring will be removed by 
    cutting into the &quot;pregnant&quot; trunk, which is divided on top be a 
    V-shaped cleft before being separated in half vertically along the center 
    by a thin red line that thickens as it reaches the bottom (where the blood 
    must be poured out upon the ground). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On either side of the Tree there 
    are a group of Five branches, (as in the Name Y<b>H</b>V<b>H</b>), the arrangement 
    of which strongly suggests a quincunx, <img src="../../UsedImages/SquareDalets.gif" width="14" height="14">, 
    with all its cosmic implications concerning the space-time continuum that 
    is the created world, the world into which humanity, in the persons of the 
    nude male and female, is emerging. Such an image, of course, would suggest 
    that this Tree is the World Tree at the cosmic center, and in that connection 
    the possibility of seeing this image as both an upright tree and an inverted 
    female figure links cosmic creation to human procreation. That link is one 
    of the primary concerns of the narrative myths of human creation throughout 
    Mesoamerica since it is through procreation, the uniting of the created male 
    and female, that the process of creation becomes cyclical and continuous.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Furst points out, several aspects 
    of the creation myth depicted here are similar to the Mixtec myth of creation 
    as retold by Fray Gregorio Garcia about ninety years after the Conquest, but 
    instead of the Tree Birth depicted in this scene, Garcia's legend emphasizes 
    the establishment of a Garden.&quot; </font>The Flayed God, p.153<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It happened at a particular place 
    called Tkahanahyenh...Once, a very long time ago (the Iroquois believe), a 
    boy was born in a Huron settlement on the shores of Lake Ontario. His coming 
    had been announced to his grandmother in a dream. In this dream a messenger 
    from the Great Creator told her that her daughter, a virgin, would bear a 
    son who would bring peace and life to the people of the earth. The child was 
    called Deganawidah.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Deganawidah was grown, he 
    built a great White Stone Canoe. </font>(See 1 Corinthians 10:1-4)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Bidding farewell to his mother and grandmother, he set out on his mission. 
    He would not return, he told them, but if they should wish to know how he 
    fared, they should strike a certain Tree with an axe. If blood flowed from 
    the wound, they would know that he had perished, and his mission had failed. 
    But if no blood flowed, he had accomplished his mission.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So Deganawidah set off across the 
    lake in his stone canoe. When he reached the other side, he met a band of 
    hunters. They said that they had fled their settlement because their was strife 
    in the village. Deganawidah told them to go back to the settlement and tell 
    the people that the Good News of Peace and Power would come. This they did.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next Deganawidah visited the home 
    of a woman who lived on the trail which the warriors took between east and 
    west, and who fed the passing warriors. After she had offered Deganawidah 
    food, and he had eaten, he told her of his mission.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I carry the Mind of the Master 
    of Life,&quot; he said, &quot;and my message will bring an end to wars between 
    east and west. The Word that I bring is that all peoples shall love one another 
    and live together in peace. This message has three parts: Righteousness and 
    Health and Power--Ga'iwoh, Ske'non, Gashasdenshaa. And each part has two branches...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Power means authority, the 
    authority of law and custom, backed by such force as is necessary to make

    talk of our great father; it is very kind. He says he loves his red children. 
    Brothers! When the white man first came to these shores, the Muscogees gave 
    him land, and kindled him a fire to help make him comfortable; and when the 
    pale faces of the south made war on him, their young men drew the tomahawk, 
    and protected his head from the scalping knife. But when the white man had 
    warmed himself before the Indian's fire, and filled himself with the Indian's 
    hominy, he became very large; he stopped not for the mountain tops, and his 
    feet covered the plains and the valleys. His hands grasped the eastern and 
    western sea. Then he became our great father. He loved his red children; but 
    said, &quot;You must move a little farther, lest I should, by accident, tread 
    on you.&quot; With one foot he pushed the red man over the Oconee, and with 
    the other he trampled down the graves of his fathers. But our great father 
    still loved his red children, and he soon made them another talk. He said 
    much; but it all meant nothing, but &quot;move a little farther, you are too 
    near me.&quot; I have heard a great many talks from our great father, and 
    they all began and ended the same. Brothers! When he made us a talk on a former 
    occasion, he said, &quot;Get a little farther; go beyond the Oconee and the 
    Oakmulgee; there is a pleasant country.&quot; He also said, &quot;It shall 
    be yours forever.&quot; Now he says, &quot;The land you live on is not yours; 
    go beyond the Mississippi; there is game; there you may remain while the grass 
    grows or the water runs.&quot; Brothers! Will not our great father come there

      open with great fangs to devour souls, and here too were some groups of 
      devils and bodies of serpents close to the door, and a little way off was 
      a place of sacrifice all bloodstained and black with smoke, and encrusted 
      with blood, and there were many great ollas and cantaras and tinajas (pottery 
      vessels) of water inside the house, for it was here that they cooked the 
      flesh of the unfortunate Indians who were sacrificed, which was eaten by 
      the priests </font>(see John 6:51-57)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
      There were also near the place of sacrifice many large knives and chopping 
      blocks such as those on which they cut up meat in the slaughter houses </font>(How

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And even today, in an age of Buchenwalds 
    and Hiroshimas, we are still appalled. But if we are to understand those sacrifices--which 
    surely does not mean condemning them--it is imperative that we see them in 
    the context of the mythological tradition that gave them the most sacred character 
    to those who performed them, so sacred, in fact, that even the gods, as the 
    myths will show us, were sacrificed to enable life to exist. Thus, the humans 
    who were sacrificed were reenacting the original sacrifice of the gods. They 
    were playing their parts in the continuing creation of life, demonstrating 
    once more that death must precede life in the grand cycle of the cosmos.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no better single example 
    of this fundamental idea that life comes from death, that sacrifice releases 
    the life force, than the flayed god of our title--Xipe Totec, Our Lord, the 
    Flayed One. By donning the skin of the sacrificial victim who had been flayed, 
    the priest became the god. He was Xipe Toltec, the inner essence, life itself, 
    that is always hidden beneath our outer covering...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, today's understanding 
    of that mythological tradition--one of a handful of great mythological traditions 
    created by humanity--by all but a few scholars is still as confusing and superficial 
    as it was in the time of the Conquistadors. And today we must consider an 
    additional problem as well. The Aztec culture confronted by the Spanish was 
    a very late-flowering and relatively short-lived development of the tradition 
    of which it was an integral part. The Aztec myths and gods are but the very 
    tip of the iceberg that is the mythological tradition of Mesoamerica, the 
    high-culture area comprising the southern two-thirds of today's Mexico, all 
    of Belize and Guatemala, and portions of Honduras and El Salvador, a culture 
    reaching back at least to 1400 B.C. in its history of urban civilizations, 
    with the earlier village-culture roots of those civilizations going back at

    Basin that now houses Mexico City, soon to be the largest city in the world, 
    has been for a very long time the seat of cultures that dominated, or at least 
    tried to dominate, the rest of Mesoamerica. The first of these great cultures 
    was Classic period Teotihuacan. At about the time of Christ and the inauguration 
    of the Old Word mythological tradition that bears his name, the people of 
    the area of Teotihuacan began the building of the monumental Pyramid of the 
    Sun directly above what must have been the holiest of sanctuaries, a cavern 
    deep within a long, sinuous cave formed when the lava of the area cooled millions 
    of years before. The pyramid was designed so that the cavern was directly

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the outset Teotihuacan must 
    have been seen as a sacred place, and that aura remained long after its decline

    the sacrifice of the gods, which we present in &quot;The Myths of Creation,&quot; 
    was set at Teotihuacan. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The city gradually grew in size, 
    complexity, and grandeur until, &quot;at the height of its power, around A.D. 
    500, Teotihuacan was larger than Imperial Rome&quot;...From the mythologist's 
    point of view...its religious function was paramount, and of that function. 
    Ren'e Millon, the preeminent archaeologist working at that site, says that 
    the great city </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">was above 
    all a religious center without equal in its time. We see this manifested in 
    the great pyramids, in the multiplicity of its temples, in the monumentality 
    of its principal avenue that overwhelms viewers today and that anciently must 
    have induced religious awe in believers. Teotihuacan has the unmistakable 
    aura of a sacred city...Like sacred cities elsewhere it was likely regarded 
    as the center of the cosmos and, it can be argued, the place where time began. 
    If the latter were the case...the very existence of Teotihuacan would have 
    been a perpetual commemoration of the coming into existence of the present

    still puzzles today's scholars. What is clear to everyone, however, is that 
    this city was the center of the mythological tradition of the Basin of Mexico,

  <p>&quot;The most extraordinary meeting of all took place in 1492 when Christopher 
    Columbus and his men set foot in the Americas. At that moment they reunited 
    without knowing it two portions of humanity that had been separated for about 
    four thousand years. But Columbus met no monsters. To the contrary, he was 
    favorably impressed by the first Americans he met, the gentle Arawaks. He 
    admired their appearance and their modesty (though they were naked), their 
    friendliness, and their generosity. More ominously, he added that they were 
    likely to make good and skilled servants, for they were quick to repeat whatever 
    was said to them in languages they did not understand. From the very first 
    moment, Indian servitude was in the minds of the European invaders.</p>
  <p>The Indians soon learned that the invaders wanted <i>gold</i>, <i>land</i>, 
    and<i> slaves</i>. They were amazed by the newcomers' lust for the precious 
    metal. One Aztec chronicler wrote that the Spaniards grabbed for the gold 
    as if they were monkeys. He added that &quot;they thirsted mightily for gold; 
    they stuffed themselves with it; they starved for it; they lusted for it like 
    pigs.&quot; But the Spaniards brought more than gold fever with them. They 
    brought pestilence and oppression. (Did the Roman church rebuke and oppose 
    them)? The Indians died from alien diseases before being subjugated by alien 
    power. </p>
  <p>The Aztecs who ruled despotically over a mighty empire in what is now Mexico, 
    were devastated by the arrival of the Spaniards. These strange beings were 
    preceded by fearful omens. A comet, a great fire, portentous lightning, the 
    sudden boiling up of the lake on which their city stood, strange voices, dust 
    storms, a rain of stones. Their emperor Montezuma was terrified. He feared 
    not just the end of his reign but the end of the world. Perhaps the strange 
    beings from the east were gods (see Psalm 82:6-8)? They were certainly fantastic 
    enough: clothed in metal, led by huge dogs, perhaps physically connected to 
    their horses. But gods would not throw down the oracles or mistreat the deities 
    of the Indians. Gods would not lust after gold as the Spaniards did. No, they 
    were not gods. They were more alarming still, for gods have some interest 
    in humans and can be placated by them. These beings were aliens, ruthless 
    and possessing strange powers.</p>
  <p>Those Indians who received the Spaniards courteously discovered their mistake 
    too late. So did those who allied with the Spaniards to throw off the yoke 
    of the Aztecs. They now had to live through the nightmare of being conquered 
    by fantastical creatures who considered their subjects scarcely human. Indian 
    chroniclers describe the experience. Before, as they wrote, &quot;the Indians 
    had no sickness; they had no aching bones; they had no burning chest; they 
    had no abdominal pain; they had no consumption; they had no headache. At that 
    time the course of humanity was orderly. The foreigners made it otherwise 
    when they arrived here.&quot; The Indians saw their world destroyed. As the 
    same chronicler wrote in despair. &quot;Let us therefore die! Let us therefore 
    perish! For our gods are already dead.&quot;</p>
  <p>Many of them did die. It is impossible to say how many in the absence of 
    reliable censuses, but it is certain that the invasion of the Americas produced 
    the greatest demographic disaster that the world has ever known. By the end 
    of the sixteenth century, the Indian population of the Americas had been reduced 
    by half. Those who survived faced a future of slavery, serfdom, or forced 
    labor unless they were sufficiently remote to defend themselves at the margins 
    of European settlement.&quot; (pp.13, 14).</p>

  <p>On an Indian back the priest arrives at the palace. The viceroy offers him

    archbishop is suffering the punishment of exile in remote, miserable Zamora, 
    a few priests have been sent to row in the galleys, and the hanging of three 
    or four agitators sufficed to crush the insolence...</p>

  <p>The ancient and medieval pronouncements on humans and human behavior seemed 
    to leave the Europeans little choice but to condemn the Indians as allies 
    of the Devil...The problems of explaining Africa and Asia were difficult but 
    surmountable. After all, it had always been known that they were there and, 
    if Europeans had not seen elephants, they had at least always known about 
    them. But America, who had dreamed of America? The uniqueness of the New World 
    called into question the whole Christian cosmogony. If God had created all 
    of the life forms in one week in one place and they had then spread out from 
    there over the whole world, then why are the life forms in the eastern and 
    western hemispheres so different? And if all land animals and men had drowned 
    except for those on the ark, and all that now exist are descended from those 
    chosen few, then why the different kinds of animals and men on either side 
    of the Atlantic?...And why do the Peruvian heathens worship Viracocha instead 
    of Baal' or some other demon familiar to the ancient Jews? The effort to maintain 
    the Hebraic version of the origin of life and man was to &quot;put many learned 
    Christians upon the rack to make it out.&quot;</p>
  <p>The problem tempted a few Europeans to toy with the concept of multiple creations, 
    but the mass of the people clung to monogeneticism. They had to; it was basic 
    to Christianity. For example, what would happen to the validity of the Pope's 
    1493 grant to Spain of &quot;all islands and mainlands found and to be found, 
    discovered, and to be discovered,&quot; in the western Atlantic unless their 
    inhabitants were truly men and women and thus under papal jurisdiction? The 
    famous Requirement of 1512, which the Spanish monarchs ordered the conquistadors 
    to read to the Indians so that they would realize that their subsequent slaughter 
    and subjugation were justified, opened with the statement that &quot;the Lord 
    our God, Living and Eternal, created Heaven and Earth, and one man and one 
    woman, of whom you and I, and all the men of the world, were and are descendants...&quot; 
    Being descendants of Adam and Eve, the American aborigines were subject to 
    the Pope and, by his donation of America to Spain, to Ferdinand and Isabella...</p>
  <p>The Pope denounced as satellites of the Devil those who claimed the Indians 
    &quot;should be treated as dumb brutes created for our service,&quot; a view 
    common among the conquistadors. The Pope proclaimed &quot;that the Indians 
    are truly men, and that they are not only capable of understanding the Catholic 
    faith but, according to our information, they desire exceedingly to receive 
    it.&quot; </p>
  <p>Thus it was decided by Rome that the aborigines of America were worthy of 
    conquest and too worthy to be treated as domestic animals. Again and again 
    during the centuries of European imperialism, the Christian view that all 
    men are brothers was to lead to persecution of non-Europeans--he who is my 
    brother sins to the extent that he is unlike me--and to the tempering of imperialism 
    with mercy--he who is my brother deserves brotherly love. </p>
  <p>The papacy remained undisturbed in its confidence that the Book of Genesis 
    provided all the paleontology that a Christian needed. But America was such 
    a very square peg to fit into the round hold of Genesis. In 1520 Philippus 
    Paracelsus, whose mind was ballasted with little dogma of any kind, is supposed 
    to have said that no one would easily believe that &quot;those who have been 
    found in the out-of-the-way islands...are the posterity of Adam and Eve...It 
    is most probable that they are descended from another Adam.&quot; Joseph de 
    Acosta was a churchman, but the contrast between the creatures of the Old 
    and New Worlds...led him to the brink of heresy...He offered the explanation 
    that (in America) &quot;it may be God hath made a new creation of beasts.&quot; 
    (Indeed; compare Ecclesiastes 1:1-10; 3:14-22 and Revelation 13:1)<b>.</b></p>
  <p>The problem of America troubled the seventeenth century too, helping to lead 
    some few men into unorthodoxy and at least one into jail. If Eden and Mount 
    Ararat were both in Asia, then how could man and animals be in America?...Isaac 
    de La Peyr'ere was more inspired to heresy by biblical ambiguities and references 
    in ancient documents to seemingly pre-Adamite events in Egypt and Phoenicia 
    than by the enigma of a biologically unique America, but his theory provided 
    explanations for all three sources of confusion. Adam was the product of a 
    second creation and father only to the Jews. (The Hebrews). The first Creation, 
    which preceded that of Adam by a very long time, (see Genesis 1:14-19), had 
    included the creation of the ancestors of all the non-(Hebrews)--the pre-Adamites--and 
    the Flood (if interpreted as a literal geological event, see chapter 4) had 
    been only Palestinian in extent and had not affected them.&quot; (pp. 3-13).</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;Dedicated to the countless clans, tribes and nations of indigenous 
    people throughout Mother Earth whose sacred visions, dreams, prayers, songs, 
    wisdom, experience and kind guidance form the foundation and living reality 
    of the Sacred Tree..</p>
  <p>For all the peoples of the earth, the Creator has planted a Sacred Tree under 
    which they may gather, and there find healing, power, wisdom and security. 
    The roots of this Tree spread deep into the body of Mother Earth, its branches 
    reach upward like hands praying to Father Sky. The fruits of this Tree are 
    the good things the Creator has given to the people: teachings, that show 
    the path to love, compassion, generosity, patience, wisdom, justice, courage, 
    respect, humility and many other wonderful gifts.</p>
  <p>The ancient ones taught us that the life of the Tree is the life of the people. 
    If the people wander far away from the protective shadow of the Tree, if they 
    forget to seek the nourishment of its fruits, or if they should turn against 
    the Tree and attempt to destroy it, great sorrow will fall upon the people. 
    Many will become sick at heart. The people will lose their power. They will 
    cease to dream dreams and see visions. They will begin to quarrel among themselves 
    over worthless trifles. They will become unable to tell the truth and to deal 
    with each other honestly. They will forget how to survive in their own land. 
    Their lives will become filled with anger and gloom. Little by little they 
    will poison themselves and all they touch.</p>
  <p>It was foretold that these things would come to pass, but that the Tree would 
    never die. And as long as the Tree lives, the people live. It was also foretold 
    that the day would come when the people would awaken, as if from a long drugged 
    sleep, that they would begin, timidly at first but then with great urgency, 
    to search again for the Sacred Tree.</p>
  <p>The knowledge of its whereabouts, and of the fruits that adorn its branches, 
    have always been carefully guarded and preserved within the minds and hearts 
    of our wise elders and leaders. These humble, loving and dedicated souls will 
    guide anyone who is honestly and sincerely seeking along the path leading 
    to the protecting shadow of the Sacred Tree.&quot;</p>

  National Geographical Society).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;Interest and excitement about the past have deep roots in America. 
    Almost as soon as European settlers reached these shores, there was speculation 
    about the stone tools and carvings found in woods or turned up by plows. Earthworks, 
    especially, suggested a notable prehistory. Yet such remains were not considered 
    old at all by present standards, certainly no more than a thousand years. 
    This, of course, reflected the age of the earth proposed by biblical scholars. 
    Further, a single culture was thought responsible for all prehistoric materials 
    and this was variously identified--one of Lost Tribes of Israel, the Welsh, 
    ancient Egyptians or Phoenicians, or occupants of the lost continent of Atlantis 
    or Mu. Whoever they were, many Americans assumed, they could not have been 
    the ancestors of those ferocious, impoverished Indians seen over the sights 
    of a gun...</p>
  <p>Now a more complex picture of America's past began to emerge, with a realization 
    that Indians, not some &quot;lost race,&quot; had created these prehistoric 
    remains. The past lengthened, as the timetables of geology gained wider acceptance. 
    Step by step, the beginnings and content of prehistory were pushed backward...Today 
    we feel confident in saying that man must have reached this continent more 
    than 25,000 years ago.&quot; (Douglas W. Schwartz, pp.9-38).</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;It may appear that I have sufficiently discussed the origins of man 
    and thereby eliminated the Bering Strait theory as a possible explanation 
    of the source of the occupancy of the Western Hemisphere by American Indians 
    and that devoting more time to this idea is superfluous. Nothing could be 
    farther from the truth. Most Americans do not see the connection between the 
    different scientific theories, nor do they understand that a shift or collapse 
    of a major scientific doctrine requires a significant adjustment of all subsidiary 
    doctrines that relied on it for their validity. Thus, people accepting the 
    idea that outmoded explanations of human evolution have been modified substantially 
    will continue to hold with the Bering Strait theory even though to do so is 
    a great inconsistency. But another point must be made which requires a chapter 
    of discussion--and that is whether or not the Bering Strait is simply shorthand 
    scientific language for &quot;I don't know, but it sounds good and no one 
    will check.&quot;</p>
  <p>There are immense contemporary political implications to this theory which 
    make it difficult for many people to surrender. Considerable residual guilt 
    remains over the manner in which the Western Hemisphere was invaded and settled 
    by Europeans. Five centuries of brutality lie uneasy on the conscience, and 
    consequently two beliefs have arisen which are used to explain away this dreadful 
    history. People want to believe that the Western Hemisphere, and more particularly 
    North America, was a vacant, unexploited, fertile land waiting to be put under 
    cultivation according to God's holy dictates. As Woodie Guthrie put it: &quot;This 
    land is your land, this Land is my land.&quot; The hemisphere thus belonged 
    to whoever was able to rescue it from its wilderness state.</p>
  <p>Coupled with this belief is the idea that American Indians were not original 
    inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere but latecomers who had barely unpacked 
    before Columbus came knocking on the door. If Indians had arrived only a few 
    centuries (or even a few millennia) earlier, they had no real claim to land 
    that could not be swept away by European discovery...</p>
  <p>These ideas have great impact on how non-Indians view the claims for justice 
    made by Indians...(In a Nebraska courtroom, after a challenge of land claims 
    made against the Sioux nation by the United States, one of the litigants) 
    gushed over what had been said about the Bering Strait as if she were the 
    chairperson of an anthropology department and left me with the comment: &quot;Well 
    dearie, we are all immigrants from somewhere.&quot; After reflecting on her 
    comment...I wanted to run down the hallway after her and say, &quot;Yes, indeed, 
    but it makes one helluva difference whether we came 100,000 years ago or just 
    out of boat steerage a generation back.&quot;</p>
  <p>Her remark was symptomatic of the non-Indian response to the pleas of Indians. 
    By making us immigrants to North America they are able to deny the fact that 
    we were the full, complete, and total owners of this continent. They are able 
    to see us simply as earlier interlopers and therefore throw back at us the 
    accusation that we had simply &quot;found&quot; North America a little earlier 
    than they had.&quot; (pp.67-70).</p>

    But such speculation cannot destroy the inherent interest of the subject, 
    however much they may irritate those who desire to arrive at logical conclusions 
    concerning it. Who then were the folks who raised the mounds of Ohio and the 
    Mississippi and spread their culture from the Gulf states region to the Great 
    Lakes? Needless to say, the 'antiquaries' of the last century stoutly maintained 
    that they were strangers from over the sea, sun- and serpent-worshippers who 
    had forsaken the cities of Egypt, Persia and Phoenicia, and had settled in 
    the West in order to pursue their strange religion undisturbed. But such a

    a number of years, but by his defeat at Tippecanoe (and the battles at Detroit

<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;These calendar matters, linked with Celtic religion, and hence reflected 
    in the physical orientation of their religious buildings, are undoubtedly 
    to be traced to an ancient cult of sun worship, and certain symbols widely 
    distributed across the Old World at sites where where the sun was worshipped 
    in ancient times occur also on the walls and lintels of some of the Celtic 
    temples in New England. They are also found at some other sites linked with 
    various tribes of North American Indians, and there can be no doubt that the 
    Indian shamans acquired these symbols from contact with ancient colonists 
    in America such as the Celts...</p>
  <p>We can extend these studies to the Algonquian languages, and work now in 
    progress shows substantial numbers of Siberian roots occur in the Western 
    dialects of Algonquian, the proportion diminishing as one passes eastward 
    into the New England area...For example, the word &quot;matsu,&quot; and similar 
    forms, designates &quot;tree&quot; in the northeast Siberian tongues, the 
    root element being the syllable ma-. As one passes into the Americas, words 
    very similar to &quot;matsu&quot; are used for tree all across the Algonquian 
    belt until one reaches New England. There an abrupt change occurs, and the 
    word for tree in the Wabanaki dialect of Maine becomes &quot;abassi.&quot; 
    Now &quot;abassi&quot; means &quot;foeman&quot; in the Siberian tongues, so 
    why does it designate a tree in New England. The answer is simple, it is not 
    a Siberian word at all, but instead a well-known Semitic word, meaning &quot;tree&quot; 
    and still in use today among Hebrew-speaking people of Israel, the language 
    of which is related to Phoenician...</p>
  <p>Take the name of the Amoskeag River, for example...When I first visited the 
    site the name meant nothing to me and I assumed it to be Algonquian, but never 
    thought to inquire if the name had a meaning. Indeed it has, as J. Almus Russell 
    has pointed out...According to Russell, competent scholarship shows that the 
    Algonquian sense of &quot;Amoskeag&quot; is &quot;one who takes small fish.&quot; 
    But no sooner had I seen this translation than I immediately recognized the 
    word as the Celtic &quot;Ammo-iasgag,&quot; which means &quot;small fish stream.&quot; 
    The Gaelic word for fish is &quot;iasg&quot; and the suffix -ag is the sign 
    of the diminutive, giving the sense &quot;small fish.&quot; Evidently the 
    main purport of the name was imparted to the Algonquian Indians by the Celts, 
    but some details of the sense as well as the precise pronunciation have been 
    blurred with the passage of time.&quot; (pp.142, 283, 248).</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;By A.D. 800, as the Mayans declined in Mexico and Europe muddled through 
    the Dark Ages, Cahokia was ripe for the emergence of a great civilization 
    based on agriculture. The physical and cultural environments there offered 
    the fruits of thousands of years of development to the emerging Mississippi 
    people...</p>
  <p>Cahokia's (Illinois) geographical setting at the confluence of three major 
    rivers and four ecozones was ideal. The meeting of the Mississippi, Missouri, 
    and Illinois Rivers created an exceptionally fertile and expansive flood plain 
    called the American Bottom...</p>
  <p>Not only did the emerging Mississippians at Cahokia have the benefit of favorable 
    conditions in the American Bottom, but they also profited from contact with 
    other cultures that had developed throughout North America...From their central 
    position they traveled vast distances...They got copper from the Upper Great 
    Lakes, mica from the southern Appalachians , and seashells from the Gulf of 
    Mexico. And in the process of obtaining these materials, they observed traditions 
    and lifestyles they would incorporate into their own.</p>
  <p>Despite striking similarities to features of cultures in Mexico and elsewhere, 
    there is no scientific evidence <font size="2">(ah, but the historical evidence 
    is overwhelming)</font><b> </b>that several Mississippi trademarks--flat-topped 
    temple mounds, calendric systems<b> </b>(a solar woodhenge)<b>, </b>and ceramic 
    styles--were the result of anything other than independent invention.<font size="2"> 
    (How silly)</font>. No Mexican artifacts have been found in the American Bottom 
    or in any other part of this country outside of the southwest... (pp.8-13).</p>

    they can not see plainly beyond the Midwestern Plain. They do not understand

  <p>&quot;There is evidence that Cahokia was a theocratic chieftanship: that

  <p>&quot;De Soto was a hard man, &quot;much given,&quot; said a contemporary, 
    &quot;to the sport of hunting Indians.&quot; From the beginning he chose to 
    adopt a policy of intimidation. The Indians had never seen a horse, and were 
    terrified (initially) by the prospect of a figure half-man half-beast. Often, 
    as Garcilaso emphasized, the mere appearance of the cavalry would scatter 
    determined parties of warriors...The Indians were hunted, harassed, and finally 
    harnessed to the cause, enslaved as porters and menials. Recalcitrant braves 
    had a hand or a nose--or head--struck from the living flesh as an example 
    to others. Many women were seized, said Ranjel, &quot;and these not old nor 
    the most ugly&quot; because they were &quot;desired for both as servants and 
    for foul uses and lewdness.&quot;</p>
  <p>Thus De Soto fought his way along a great perambulating journey to find wealth 
    like that of the Incas. He was disastrously unsuccessful in this venture, 
    though he pursued it mightily for three incredible years. His general route 
    is known. It traversed some 350,000 square miles of Indian domains, frequently 
    and understandable hostile. From present-day Florida he went north through

  <p>&quot;The capitalist rulers of the United States mounted to power through 
    a series of violent struggles against precapitalist social forces. The first 
    of these upheavals took place at the dawn of modern American history with 
    the invasion of the Western Hemisphere by the nations of Western Europe and 
    the conquest of the aboriginal inhabitants. The uprooting of the Indians played 
    a significant part in clearing the way for bourgeois supremacy on this continent.</p>
  <p>However, the pages of the most learned historians contain little recognition 
    and less understanding of this connection between the overthrow of Indian 
    tribalism and the development of bourgeois society in America. As a rule, 
    they regard the ousting and obliteration of the natives simply as an incident 
    in the spread of the white man over the continent. They may condemn the treatment 
    of the Indians as a lamentable blot on the historical record, but they do 
    not see that it has any important bearing upon the formation of the United 
    States. <font size="2">(And they have certainly lost sight of the fact that

    instructive illustration of how far the Indian conquest has faded from the 
    consciousness of bourgeois thinkers. During a speech at the New York Herald 
    Tribune Forum in October 1948, Conant stated: &quot;In the first place, this 
    nation, unlike most others, has not evolved from a state founded on a military 
    conquest. As a consequence we have nowhere in our tradition the idea of an 
    aristocracy descended from the conquerors and entitled to rule by right of 
    birth. On the contrary, we have developed our greatness in a period in which 
    a fluid society overran a rich and empty continent...&quot;</p>
  <p>The contemporary professors do not know how to fit the Indians, and the facts 
    of their dispossession and disappearance, into their schemes of interpretation 
    any more than the pioneers were able to absorb them into bourgeois society. 
    The government's final solution of the Indian problem has been to segregate 
    the survivors in reservations, an American equivalent of the European concentration 
    camps and the African compounds. The historians dispose of the Indians by 
    also setting them off to one side, in a special category detached from the 
    main course of American historical development.</p>
  <p>Indeed, because of their unconscious and narrow class outlook, the bourgeois 
    historians, on the whole, are hardly aware that the fate of the Indians presents 
    any problem. They assume that private property must be the normal foundation 
    of any &quot;good&quot; society. And so, the annihilation of Indian collectivism 
    by the white conquerors for the sake of private property seems so much in 
    the nature of things as to require no explanation...</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>But there is more involved than inertia or indifference. Freud has explained 
    individual lapses of memory by an unconscious wish to hide from what is shameful, 
    fearful, socially unacceptable. Where a social lapse of memory occurs, a similar 
    mechanism and similar motives for suppression are often at work, especially 
    where representatives of ruling classes engage in systematic forgetfulness. 
    That is the case here. The abominable treatment of the Indians is extremely 
    unpleasant to contemplate, and equally unpleasant to explain.</p>
  <p>At the bottom of their censorship lies the bourgeois attitude toward the 
    communal character of Indian life. The bourgeois mind finds communism in any 
    form so contrary to its values, so abhorrent and abnormal, that it recoils 
    from its manifestations and instinctively strives to bury recollections of 
    their existence. In any event, the run-of-the-mill historian feels little 
    impulse to examine and explain primitive communism although it was the cradle 
    of humanity and, in particular, formed a starting point of modern American 
    history.&quot; (pp.7-10).<i><font size="+1"> </font></i></p>

<p><font size="+1"><i>America's Wars &amp; Military Encounters from Colonial Times</i>... 
  by Edwin P. Hoyt.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This study of America's wars and military excursions is intended to give 
    readers a sense of the continuity of the American military presence over four 
    centuries. (See Genesis 15:12-16). The book is proof of the old adage that 
    wars and military excursions are extensions of political policy. For the most 
    part wars represent a failure of politicians, (but moreso, a failure of the 
    priests and ministers of the Gospel to rebuke the politicians, and to endure 
    steadfastly in the teachings of Christ), whether it be by the Massachusetts 
    Colony's refusal to treat the Indians fairly, which was the beginning of the 
    long period of Indian wars that did not end until the Wounded Knee massacre 
    in 1890, or the concentration of political errors that involved the United 
    States in the war in Vietnam...</p>
  <p>The French and Indian wars began, really, with King Philip's War in Massachusetts 
    in 1671. To be sure, there had been previous troubles with Indians. In Virginia 
    the whole first colony had been wiped out by famine, pestilence, and Indian 
    warfare in the sixteenth century. In 1636, racial antagonism had boiled over 
    in Massachusetts with the murder of a New England trader named John Oldham. 
    Colonial troops from Massachusetts and Connecticut decided to destroy the 
    Pequot tribe, whose members lived between the Thames River and the present 
    eastern boundary of Rhode Island, as well as on Long Island. On May 26, 1637, 
    the English colonists ravaged the main Pequot village, at the site of what 
    is now Stonington, Connecticut, and virtually exterminated the Pequots in 
    the whole area.</p>
  <p>King's Philip's War, which began in 1671, was the result of the Indian realization 
    that individual tribes could do nothing against the English. The tribal leaders 
    believed they could unite and act together to drive the English out of North 
    America. They were fifty years too late...The Indians lost King Philip's War, 
    and the tribal remnants were thereafter driven westward by English expansion. 
    Indian resentment became a ready tool for the French, who coveted all of North 
    America as eagerly as did the English. In the wars that spread across the 
    Atlantic from Europe, the French enlisted the Indians, particularly the Hurons, 
    to harry the western boundaries of the English colonies. The French and Indian 
    Wars continued unabated from the last of the 1600s until the 1750s...</p>
  <p>In prosecution, the American Revolution was a peculiarly violent war, a civil 
    war in every sense of the word, with brother pitted against brother and father 
    against son. The British added two elements which made the war even more vicious: 
    the Indians who fought the colonists for vengeful reasons of their own, and 
    the Hessians, those hired peasant boys from Germany, who knew nothing about 
    the language, the customs, or the terrain of the country in which they fought, 
    and were the more savage for that. When the war ended, the Hessians went home 
    to Europe...but the Indians had nowhere to go, and successive generations 
    of Indians paid dearly for the excesses of their forebears until the late 
    nineteenth century when General William <i>Tecumseh</i> Sherman enunciated 
    an American policy that had been building up for years: extermination.&quot;

<p align="center">By William Albert Allard </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;Before the continent was called America, before white men came looking 
    for land, Nez Perce children learned many things through the imagery of legends. 
    From the adventures of Coyote, Fox, and Grizzly Bear they learned the virtues 
    of bravery and honor, and the tragedy of greed. Around the warmth of winter 
    fires they came to understand the mysteries of plants and animals and the 
    sacredness of Mother Earth. And on one of the most ancient legends they learned 
    that Coyote had once predicted the coming of &quot;new age&quot;--the time 
    of &quot;human beings.&quot; With that age, he had said, would come a struggle 
    to overcome sorrow.</p>
  <p>Today many of those legends have been forgotten, buried with the bones of 
    the old people who knew them as well as they knew the freedom of eagles. And 
    locked in the deep silence of their graves are the stories of those who struggled 
    to overcome the terrible sorrow of freedom lost.</p>
  <p>In a weed-choked cemetery in Nespelem, Washington, on the Colville Indian 
    Reservation, stands a monument to past bravery and old sorrows. There on a 
    gray dirt hillside, a marble column rises in modest elegance amid other graves 
    marked with crosses of weathered wood or clusters of rocks. Carved into the 
    column is the face of a handsome man and the words: &quot;He led his people 
    in the Nez Perce War of 1877. Age, about 60 years. Died September 21, 1904.&quot; 
    His name: Hinmahtooyahletkekht--Thunder Rolling in the Mountains. He had another 
    name as well, more deeply etched in history than in stone. It was Joseph.</p>
  <p>&quot;All men were created by the same Great Spirit Chief. They are all brothers. 
    The earth is the mother of all people, and all people should have equal rights 
    upon it. You might as well expect the rivers to run backward as that any man 
    who was born a free man should be contented penned up and denied liberty to 
    go where he pleases...&quot; Chief Joseph.</p>
  <p>&quot;Say to us if you can say it, that you were sent by the Creative Power 
    to talk to us. Perhaps you think the Creator sent you here to dispose of us 
    as you see fit. If I thought you were sent by the Creator I might be induced 
    to think you had a right to dispose of me. Do not misunderstand me, but understand 
    me fully with reference to my affection for the land. I never said the land 
    was mine to do with as I chose. The one who has the right to dispose of it 
    is the one who created it. I claim a right to live on my land, and accord 
    you the privilege to live on yours.&quot; Chief Joseph.</p>
  <p>&quot;It is cold, and we have no blankets. The little children are freezing 
    to death. My people, some of them have run away to the hills, and have no 
    blankets, no food. No one knows where they are--perhaps freezing to death. 
    I want to have time to look for my children, and see how many of them I can 
    find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me. my chiefs! I am tired. 
    My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more 
    forever.&quot; Chief Joseph. (National Geographic).</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;The ghost dance was peaceful, but whites thought of it as the signal 
    for a great Indian uprising. They asked the army for help, and in the end 
    many unarmed ghost dancers, mostly woman and children, were killed at Wounded 
    Knee. We Indians think that the white people were afraid of the ghost dance 
    because they had a bad conscience having taken away half of the remaining 
    Indian land just a few years before. People with bad consciences live in fear, 
    and they hate most those whom they have wronged. Thus it was with the ghost 
    dance.</p>
  <p>At the time, Sitting Bulll lived on the Standing Rock Reservation in North 
    Dakota with his Hunkpapa people. He was not, as some people think, the war 
    leader who defeated Custer on the Little Big Horn. He was a holy man, the 
    spiritual leader of the Sioux nation. He got along well with some whites, 
    even had a few white friends, but he always said: &quot;I want the white man 
    beside me, not above me.&quot; Sitting Bull, or Tantaka Iyotake, as he is 
    called in Sioux, was a proud and dignified man, and nobody's slave.</p>
  <p>Now, at some time before 1890, Sitting Bull had joined Buffalo Bill's Wild 
    West Show. He had traveled all over the country. In New York he could be seen 
    sitting on a doorstep on Broadway, giving nickels to poor street urchins and 
    saying that white folks did not know how to take care of their children. He 
    also said that all children--red, white, black, yellow--were alike in their 
    innocence, and that if grown-ups could remain children in their hearts, all 
    would be well...</p>
  <p>At that time the Great White Father in Washington, and the white agents who 
    ruled the reservations, thought that the solution to what they called the 
    &quot;Indian problem&quot; was for Indians to behave like whites: to speak 
    and dress like whites, to become Christians and worship like whites, to own 
    property and work like whites, to marry whites, and to be swallowed up by 
    white society. The &quot;problem&quot; would be solved by simply having no 
    more Indians, by letting them disappear into the great American melting pot.</p>
  <p>Sitting Bull opposed this. He did not want the Indians to die out. He wanted 
    them to remain true to their old ways, to go on worshipping the Great Spirit, 
    to continue speaking their own language and singing their old Sioux songs...</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>And because Sitting Bull was a Wichasa Wakan, a medicine man, the most respected 
    one among Lakota people, many Indians rallied around him. Thus he became the 
    center of the resistance to be swallowed up by the culture of the whites. 
    And thus he became the enemy of those who wanted to make the Indians into 
    white men.</p>
  <p>They said that he stood in the path of progress, and the ghost dance trouble 
    seemed a good opportunity to get rid of the old chief. He was accused of siding 
    with the dancers and protecting them. The white reservation chief sent out 
    the Indian police, forty-three of them, to arrest Sitting Bull. If he resisted 
    and was killed, so much the better. The police force was made up of what we 
    now call &quot;apples,&quot; men who are red outside and white inside. They 
    were led by Lieutenants Shave Head and Bull Head.</p>
  <p>The police came to arrest the great leader before dawn on an icy winter morning. 
    The ground was covered with snow. They burst into his one-room log cabin with 
    six-shooters drawn. They dragged him naked from beneath his buffalo robe and 
    pushed him outside; they would not even let him dress properly. They kept 
    pushing at him as they put handcuffs on. The commotion awoke Sitting Bull's 
    friends and relatives...A woman's voice rose in a song:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>Sitting Bull, You were a Warrior once, What are you going to do now?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The old chief stopped abruptly. He pushed the policemen away, saying: &quot;I 
    won't go!&quot; Immediately one of the police chiefs shot him through the 
    body, and an all-out fight to the death began.&quot; (pp.267-269).</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;Probably every Indian tribe, north and south, had its early hero god, 
    the great doer or teacher of first things...Among the roving tribes of the 
    north this hero is hardly more than an expert magician, frequently degraded 
    to to the level of common trickster, who, after ridding the world of giants 
    and monsters, and teaching his people a few simple arts, retires to the upper 
    world to rest and smoke until some urgent necessity again requires his presence 
    below. Under softer southern skies the myth takes more poetic form and the 
    hero becomes a person of dignified presence, a father and teacher of his children, 
    a very Christ, worthy of all love and reverence who gathers together the wandering 
    nomads and leads them to their destined country...&quot;Under him the earth 
    teemed with fruits and flowers without the pains of culture. An ear of Indian 
    corn was as much as a single man could carry...</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>In short, these were the halcyon days, which find a place in the mythic systems 
    of so many nations in the Old World. (See Numbers 13:21-25). It was the golden 
    age of Anahuac. When at last his work is well accomplished, he bids farewell 
    to his sorrowing subjects, whom he consoles with the sacred promise that he 
    will one day return and resume his kingdom, steps into his magic boat by the 
    seashore, and sails away out of their sight to the distant land of the Sunrise.</p>
  <p>Such was Quetzalcoatl of the Aztecs...Curiously enough, this god, at once 
    a Moses and a Messiah, is usually described as a white man with flowing beard. 
    From this and other circumstances it has been argued that the whole story 
    is only another form of the dawn myth, but whether the Indian god be an ancient 
    deified lawgiver of their own race, or some nameless missionary who found 
    his way across the trackless ocean in the early ages of Christianity, or whether 
    we have here only a veiled parable of the morning light bringing life and 
    joy to the world and then vanishing to return again from the east with the 
    dawn, it is sufficient to our purposes that the belief in the coming of a 
    messiah, who should restore them to their original happy condition, was well 
    nigh universal among the American tribes.</p>
  <p>The faith in the return of a white deliverer from the east opened the gate 
    to the Spaniards at their first coming alike in Haiti, Mexico, Yucatan and 
    Peru. The...natives welcomed the white strangers as the children or kindred 
    of their long-lost benefactor, immortal beings whose near advent had been 
    foretold by oracles and omens, whose faces borrowed from the brightness of 
    the dawn, whose glistening armor seemed woven from the rays of sunlight, (see 
    Ephesians 6:10-17), and whose god-like weapons were the lightning and the 
    thunderbolt. Their first overbearing demands awakened no resentment; for may 
    not the gods claim their own, and is not resistance to the divine will a crime? 
    Not until their most sacred things were trampled under foot, and the streets 
    of the holy city itself ran red with the blood of their slaughtered princes, 
    did they read aright the awful prophecy by the light of their blazing temples, 
    and know that instead of the children of an incarnate god they had welcomed 
    a horde of incarnate devils...&quot; (pp.20, 21).</p>

<p align="center">THE DOCTRINE OF THE GHOST DANCE</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">You must not fight. Do no harm to anyone. Do right always.--Wovoka</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The great underlying principle of the Ghost Dance doctrine is that 
    the time will come when the whole Indian race, living and dead, will be reunited 
    upon a regenerated earth, to live a life of aboriginal happiness forever free 
    from death, disease, and misery. On this foundation each tribe built a structure 
    from its own mythology, and each believer and apostle has filled in the details 
    according to his own mental capacity...with such additions as come to him 
    from the trance...The differences of interpretation are precisely such as 
    we find in Christianity, with its hundreds of sects and innumerable shades 
    of individual opinion. The white race, being alien and secondary and hardly 
    real, has no part in this scheme of aboriginal regeneration, and will be left 
    behind with the other things of the earth that have served their temporary 
    purpose, or else will cease entirely to exist.</p>
  <p>All this is to be brought about by an overruling spiritual power that needs 
    no assistance from human creatures; and though certain medicine-men were disposed 
    to anticipate the Indian millennium by preaching resistance to the further 
    encroachments of the whites, such teachings form no part of the true doctrine, 
    and it was only where chronic dissatisfaction was aggravated by recent grievances, 
    as among the Sioux, that the movement assumed a hostile expression. On the 
    contrary, all believers were exhorted to make themselves worthy of the predicted 
    happiness by discarding all things warlike and practicing honesty, peace, 
    and good will, not only among themselves, but also toward the whites, so long 
    as they were together. Some apostles have even thought that all race distinctions 
    are to be obliterated, and that the whites are to participate with the Indians 
    in the coming felicity; but it seems unquestionable that this is equally contrary 
    to the doctrine as originally preached...</p>
  <p>The messiah (Wovoka) himself has set several dates from time to time,as one 
    prediction after another failed to materialize, and in his message to the 
    Cheyenne and Arapaho, in August 1891, he leaves the whole matter an open question. 
    The date universally recognized among all the tribes immediately prior to 
    the Sioux outbreak was the spring of 1891. As springtime came and passed, 
    and summer grew and waned, and autumn faded again into winter without the 
    realization of their hopes and longings, the doctrine gradually assumed its 
    present form--that some time in the unknown future the Indian will be united 
    with his friends who have gone before, to be forever supremely happy, and 
    that this happiness may be anticipated in dreams, if not actually hastened 
    in reality, by earnest and frequent attendance on the sacred dance.&quot;

  <p>You can't define Him. He's not actually a &quot;He&quot; or a &quot;She,&quot;

  <p>TALKING TO GOD...When we want wisdom we go up on the hill and talk to God. 
    Four days and four nights, without food and water. Yes, you can talk to God 
    up on a hill by yourself. You can say anything you want. Nobody's there to 
    listen to you. That's between you and God and nobody else.</p>
  <p>It's a great feeling to be talking to God. I know. I did it way up on the 
    mountain. The wind was blowing. It was dark. It was cold. And I stood there 
    and I talked to God.</p>
  <p>LISTENING TO GOD...When I go up on the hill to pray I don't just talk to 
    God. I try to get the talking over quick. Mostly I'm listening. Listening 
    to God--that's praying too.</p>
  <p>You've got to listen. God's talking to you right now. He's telling you all 
    the words you've got to speak and all the things you've got to do in this 
    life. If you don't listen, you don't hear what God's saying, and then you

  <p>So that's how you pray to God. You listen.</p>
  <p>A TALK WITH A CONGRESSMAN...I had a talk with a congressman about why we 
    won't sell the Black Hills. He asked me, &quot;Why do you Indians need all 
    that land? You don't do anything with the land you've already got. Why do 
    you need more? We'll give you some money instead of those hills.&quot;</p>
  <p>I told him, right there in the halls of Congress...&quot;You say I don't 
    <i>do</i> anything with my land? Well, what do you mean by doing? To the White 
    Man, doing means changing things, destroying everything, chopping the forests 
    and damming the rivers and polluting the skies. White Man wants us to be like 
    him and build factories and motels and hamburger stands?</p>
  <p>You say I don't <i>do</i> anything with our land? What I do is live there 
    by God's Law. That's what I do there.&quot;</p>
  <p>THE BLACK HILLS...The Black Hills are where we came out of the Earth, where 
    our ancestors are buried, where we go for sacred ceremony. They are the birthplace 
    of Lakota people. The White Man wants us to take a hundred million dollars 
    for our Black Hills. But a hundred billion wouldn't be enough. Not even four 
    hundred billion. That wouldn't even pay for the damages you've done.</p>
  <p>You can never pay us for what you've stolen or destroyed. You can never pay 
    for all the eagles you've killed, for all the buffalo, all the wild game. 
    No, and you can never pay us for all the Indians you've killed.</p>
  <p>The Black Hills aren't for sale. What if we offered you a hundred million 
    dollars for the Vatican, for Jerusalem?</p>
  <p>HOW WILL YOU PAY US...White Man thinks he can buy everything. He thinks money 
    can buy our Black Hills. He's wrong again. God gave us those hills. They're 
    holy. You can't have them.</p>
  <p>You think it's an accident that the White Man drove us back into those hills 
    and badlands only to find that this land was rich with gold and copper and 
    coal and uranium? Now you want the uranium. But you can't have it. We are 
    the guardians of the uranium of Grandmother Earth. You can't have it. You'll 
    only use it to destroy God's world.</p>
  <p>I asked one of your congressmen where the United States was going to get 
    all the money that your Supreme Court says you owe us for stealing the Black 
    Hills. He said, &quot;Why, we'll get it from the U.S. Treasury.&quot; I had 
    to laugh,,,&quot;And where did your Treasury get that money? I'll tell you 
    where you got it. You stole it from us. That's not your money. That's Indian 
    money. You stole our hills, our resources, then you put the profits in your 
    Treasury. And now you're going to take a little bit of that money...and give 
    it back to us as full payment. You're going to pay us with our own money! 
    You must think we are crazy, but we're not. WE WANT OUR HILLS BACK.&quot;</p>
  <p>GOD'S JUDGMENT: A PROPHECY...I prophesy many things that come to pass. God 
    is going to put a judgment on the world. He's mad. I'm sorry it's going to 
    happen. He's not going to destroy the whole world, but every living thing 
    will perish, and it'll be maybe another million years before a new life begins 
    again. All because of White Man's wickedness.</p>
  <p>Grandmother Earth will be alone. She's going to rest.</p>
  <p>You're going to fall and fall hard. You're going to be crying and wailing. 
    You'll realize that you can't get away with destroying God's world. Don't 
    think you can get away with it. God's going to wipe the wickedness from the 
    Earth. You can see His signs...</p>
  <p>You white people are going to learn the most important lessons--that God 
    is the most important thing there is...We Indians aren't afraid to die. We 
    got a place to go, to a better place, so we don't care. We're ready. We just 
    want you white people to know. Maybe you can change, maybe you can stop what's 
    coming. There's not much time.</p>
  <p>A MESSAGE TO THE WHITE MAN...God put us both on this Earth, the Red Man and 
    the White Man. I don't know why. There's a reason. I've looked for it all 
    my life and I'm sorry to say I havn't found it. I can't understand why He 
    sent you here to destroy His own Creation. It's a mystery. But God is always 
    a mystery. I try to work with the mystery even when I don't understand it.</p>
  <p>We're both God's children. When White Man came here he said that he was our 
    Father. But he's not. Only God is our Father, and the Earth is our Mother. 
    We Indians have proof of that, because our skin is the color of Mother Earth. 
    God meant us to live in peace. He has a purpose for each of us. He doesn't 
    want one of us to kill the other.</p>
  <p>It's been a long war between our two people. Five hundred years. We want 
    it to end. Maybe White Man think's he's already won. But you can't win when 
    you go against God, against Nature. All you win is God's wrath and God's judgment. 
    God will always be the winner.</p>

<p><i><font size="+1">Seasons of Our Joy</font></i><font size="+1">, by Arthur 
  Waskow.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;What do we accomplish by acting out the cycle, using the symbols, telling 
    the stories?</p>
  <p>Long ago our people believed that if we celebrate the cycle, the cycle was 
    more likely to continue. The rains would come when they were due, the sun 
    would shine more warmly in its season, the crops would grow--and die, and 
    grow again. </p>
  <p>If we celebrated the cycle, we believed, our deliverance from slavery would 
    come again. The spiral of history would keep on circling upward if we lived 
    through the spirals of our past. Someday the spiral would free us fully--with 
    Messiah.</p>
  <p>And there is one more reason to observe the cycle: from the beginning the 
    Jewish people have celebrated the festivals in order to honor the Unity that 
    underlies all life. The very interweaving of the themes of history and nature, 
    the human life cycle and moments of spiritual experience--remind us that in 
    some sense all the realms of life are Dancing with each other. The circles 
    of the Sun, and of the Moon; of a single human life between the generations, 
    and an entire people's history of renewal; of every quiet act of newness, 
    birth, creation--are all echoes of One Circle.&quot;</p>

<p><i><font size="+1">The Truth of a Hopi</font></i><font size="+1">, by Edmund 
  Nequatwa.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">THE RETURN OF THE BAHANA</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;All this time the Hopi seemed to know that the real Bahana was coming, 
    but they were warned to be careful and patient, for fear that it might not 
    be the true Bahana who would come after the Spaniard or Castillian. So if 
    he ever did come they must be sure to ask him about his books, which they 
    thought would contain his secrets, and it was said that the book of truth 
    would not be on top, but at the very bottom after all the other books. If 
    he asked the Hopi for the privilege of teaching them his language and taught 
    them how to write, they must be sure to ask that they would like to be taught 
    in the book of truth, because if he was the true Bahana he would quickly consent 
    to teach them of this book. For their belief is, that if he is not the one 
    they are looking for he will refuse to teach them his religion. Now if they 
    learned his religion they would compare it with their religion and ceremonies, 
    and if these were alike they would know that the Bahana had been with them 
    in the beginning.</p>
  <p>Most everybody was anxious to see the Bahana come, for they were afraid that 
    he might not come in their lifetime, and they would not be able to enjoy all 
    the benefits that he was to bring with him--for the Bahana was supposed to 
    bring great knowledge with him. These people were telling their children that 
    the Bahana was wise and with his inventions had reached the rising sun and 
    was coming back to them again, for they had seen the big eastern star and 
    that was a sign and they were waiting for him. Every grandfather and grandmother 
    was telling their children that they were growing so old that they would not 
    see the Bahana. They would tell their children to go out in the mornings before 
    sunrise with sacred corn-meal to ask the sun to hurry the Bahana along so 
    that he would come soon.</p>
  <p>Well, I guess many years had passed, probably a century. You know, some were 
    rather superstitious and they would say that when the Bahana came he would 
    know who was practicing witchcraft and that he would know them by sight. They 
    said that he was to come and make peace and do away with all evil so that 
    there would be no more trouble. And so, for this reason, the people who had 
    so much trouble were the most anxious to see him come.</p>
  <p>Well, finally they heard that the Bahana was at Tsehotso (Navajo for Fort 
    Defiance), which means &quot;range of sharp-pointed rocks.&quot; He was calling 
    for the Hopi chiefs to come to that place to meet him. Now at that time all 
    the tribes were on hostile terms with one another and it was dangerous. The 
    Hopi wanted to go and see what this Bahana looked like. The chiefs from all 
    the villages went there and they told him if he was the true Bahana they would 
    shake hands and lay down their weapons, for they had a &quot;theory&quot; 
    that when the Bahana came there would be peace forever.&quot; (pp.50, 51).</p>
