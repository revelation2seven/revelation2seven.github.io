<p><font size="+1">The array of lights was spectacular, eerie, unnatural. It floated 
  silently across the night sky in front of us, and then disappeared, or burned 
  itself out somewhere north of state route 64 in northern Oklahoma. We were traveling 
  west, approaching the town of Buffalo, when it appeared to our left. &quot;Look, 
  look! look up!&quot; The others were asleep in the car. We had been on the road 
  two days, from New York City, via West Virginia, on our way to San Francisco. 
  This sight will remain with us, <i>highlighting</i>, as it were, all the others 
  we have been gathering along the way.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was as if a vast, shimmering curtain of changing hues was 
  being pulled along by a single point of light, accompanied by other trails of 
  light, all moving slowly across the sky together. The curtain seemed to shape-shift, 
  (not unlike the ghostly display of Northern Lights), emanating different colors 
  and sparks. We can recall reds and yellows, violet and blue. The sight seemed 
  to be right out of a modern-day, computer-imaged, sci-fi thriller. Richard Battles, 
  the attendant at the service station we stopped at in Buffalo--to inquire, to 
  assure ourselves that we were surely not the only ones up at this hour of the 
  morning who saw it--said that others were reporting to have seen it. &quot;Thank 
  heavens, we weren't hallucinating.&quot; Some thought it was a meteor shower 
  (of some different kind), others said it must have been some satellite or other 
  space debris breaking up. The crowd of men gathered at the little store we stopped 
  at later, just south of Springer, New Mexico, said that it was being reported 
  to have been a Russian object of some kind falling back to earth.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Whatever it turns out to have been, it has added to the other 
  recent phenomena that are heightening our awareness of the times that we ourselves 
  are passing through. The collapse of the Towers was a wholly surreal event, 
  (a Theophany), and the natural meteor shower that fell across the northern night 
  sky a month ago added to it. It all seems in some way to be asking, or prompting 
  us to pay close attention to all of the signs that are attending us. War is 
  definitely a sign from God. And there is always the idea of <i>Satan</i> himself 
  being thrown down from his presently exalted place in the heaven of human events.

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH 
  MARS</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Never again in your lifetime will 
  the Red Planet be so spectacular.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This month and next Earth is catching 
  up with Mars, an encounter that will culminate in the closest approach between 
  the two planets in recorded history. The next time Mars may come this close 
  is in 2287. Due to the way Jupiter's gravity tugs on Mars and perturbs its orbit, 
  astronomers can only be certain that Mars has not come this close to Earth in 
  the last 5,000<br>
  years but it may be aslong as 60,000 years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The encounter will culminate on August 
  27th when Mars comes to within 34,649,589 miles and will be (next to the moon) 
  the brightest object in the night sky. It will attain a magnitude of -2.9 and 
  will appear 25.11 arc seconds wide. At a modest 75-power magnification Mars 
  will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mars will be easy to spot. At the 
  beginning of August Mars will rise in the east at 10 p.m. and reach its azimuth 
  at about 3 a.m. But by the end of August when the two planets are closest, Mars 
  will rise at nightfall and reach its highest point in the sky at 12:30 a.m. 
  That's pretty convenient when it comes to seeing something that no human has 
  seen in recorded history. So mark your calendar at the beginning of August to 
  see Mars grow progressively brighter and brighter throughout the month. Share 
  with your children and grandchildren. No one alive today will ever see this 
  again.</font></p>

  2003<br>
  by Steven McFadden</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you gaze into the 
  star-filled sky this summer you will see the red planet Mars, growing larger 
  and brighter each night. This process of intensification will continue until 
  the final days of August, when Mars will appear up to six times larger and up 
  to 24 times brighter than usual. In fact, Mars will come closer to Earth at 
  that time than it has in almost 73,000 years.<br>
  <br>
  In a very real sense, Mars is &quot;in our faces&quot; this summer. We are being 
  challenged individually and collectively to find ways to express Martian energy 
  creatively and constructively. If we turn our backs and try to ignore the energy 
  of Mars at work in the<br>
  world, we may well find ourselves becoming hot, impatient, demanding, angry, 
  unfocused, and warlike. Or we may find ourselves face to face with other people 
  exhibiting those qualities. Mars is nothing to trifle with. Mars means business. 
  Mars will not be denied. Mars asks for your courage, your action, and your skill.<br>
  <br>
  In the terms of astronomy, Mars is closest to Earth when it is both in perihelion 
  (closest to the sun) and in opposition (opposite side of Earth from the Sun). 
  This year the Mars' perihelion occurs at virtually the same time as the opposition, 
  a dual phenomenon that happens about every 15 to 17 years. As it happens, on 
  August 27, 2003, Mars will be 34.65 million miles (55.76 million km) from Earth, 
  its closest approach to Earth in almost 73,000 years. The actual opposition 
  occurs three days later on August 30, 2003.<br>
  <br>
  The combination of perihelion and opposition at the same time may be challenging 
  to visualize. But if you follow the link below, it will lead you to an illustration 
  of the Mars perihelion/opposition, and it will readily become apparent what 
  is happening in the sky: http://sci2.esa.int/marsexpress/gallery/9963.html<br>
  <br>
  While astronomy offers an image of what is happening physically in the sky, 
  the much older tradition of astrology offers images of what may come to pass 
  metaphysically. In the terms of the classical Western tradition, Mars is associated 
  with desire, energy, urges, and action. The basic astrological principle was 
  articulated millennia ago by Hermes Trismegistus: &quot;As Above, So below.&quot; 
  What that means in a nutshell is that if we observe something significant in 
  the heavens, we will witness a correspondence below on Earth; and vice versa.<br>
  <br>
  So if we look above and see that Mars is &quot;in our face&quot; all summer 
  closer to the Earth than it has been in 73,000 years, especially during late 
  August and early September then we must wonder what correspondences will unfold 
  below. If the Hermetic principle is valid, then we can expect to see a noticeable 
  increase in energy of a Martian character over the next two months.<br>
  <br>
  As with all power, the energy of Mars can be used or misused. At it&sup1;s worst, 
  Mars serves the naked, hungry ego and may be expressed as impatience, irritation, 
  anger, rage, violence, and war. At its best, Mars is guided by the light of 
  the soul and is competent to get what it needs following the highest ethical 
  and spiritual principles. It is the hero, the champion, the protector of all 
  that is delicate, weak, or in need of help. Mars helps to move things forward 
  along the unfolding spiral of spiritual evolution.<br>
  <br>
  As various elders have suggested, action is the spiritual ideal of this era, 
  this time of transition. But action toward what, and directed in what manner? 
  Toward the larger end of a just and sustainable planet graced by peace, and 
  also by way of conclusion for this newsletter, I thrust upon you some rhetorical 
  questions and challenges:<br>
  <br>
  What do you need, and how do you go about getting it? What do you want, and 
  how do you go about getting it? Are you following the highest ethical principles 
  in how you get what you need and want?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do we as a nation 
  of human beings need, and how do we go about getting it? What do we as a nation 
  of human beings want, and how do we go about getting it? Are we following the 
  highest ethical principles in how we get what we need and want?<br>
  <br>
  What are you as one human being willing to fight for, preserve, and protect?<br>
  <br>
  What are we as a nation of human beings willing to fight for, preserve, and 
  protect?<br>
  <br>
  How can you use the extra-amplified energy of Mars wisely and creatively this 
  summer?<br>
  <br>
  The environmental, social, and geopolitical threats to our survival are mounting. 
  The world needs you: your vitality, your skill, and your courage. The world 
  needs also your positive, constructive activity. Come, Join the quest now. Take 
  action. Make something good happen this summer.<br>
  <br>
  Note: On August 16, as the Martian energies are building to a peak, a season 
  group of Santa Fe astrologers will explore all of these Martian themes, and 
  more, in an all-day workshop. I am happy that I will be among them. The intensive 
  workshop is entitled &quot;War, Peace and the Mars Factor.&quot; Details follow 
  in the Chiron Schedule.<br>
