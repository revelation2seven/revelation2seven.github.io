  <p align="left">The Kerry-Edwards campaign wants to kick off this final phase 
    of the campaign with a burst of grassroots energy, so all over the country 
    folks are holding house parties to watch the speech. The parties will be linked 
    together by a nation-wide conference call with John Edwards. </p>

    Bush's Operation Clean Sweep - World War IV In 2004 <br>

<p>Even though Bush II will lose the popular vote in the US presidential election 
  of 2004, his Electoral College victory seems assured. With Republican party 
  governors firmly in charge of Florida, California, Texas and New York, and supported 
  by a whopping Bush campaign war chest approaching $200 million, dubious electronic 
  voting schemes courtesy of Diebold, Lockheed Martin and other defense contractors 
  (http://www.blackboxvoting.com), it seems certain that Bush will make it back 
  to the Oval Office through the back door that is the Electoral College. And 
  if not the Electoral College then by benefit of a rebel attack on US soil which 
  kills thousands of Americans and leads to the suspension of the US Constitution. 
  That according to General Tommy Franks, USA (Ret.), who opined in the magazine 
  Cigar Aficionado that the US will have to shed its constitution in favor of 
  a military style of government. Even the notorious aristocrat Alexander Hamilton 
  would have been appalled as such a statement, as would Thomas Jefferson and 
  James Madison. But these are mediocre times in history; particularly, and dangerously, 
  in America where its people have eliminated those who might have continued to 
  wage a struggle for an equitable form of government in the US, as well as engage 
  the world through international treaty building. <br>
</p>
<p>Mediocre times produce the very worst that the world has to offer: Reagan, 
  Bin Laden, Bush, Hussein, Sharon, and Blair. None but the feeble minded could 
  draw inspiration from such a ghastly lineup of &quot;leaders&quot;. This is 
  the world as it has become absent the shortenedlives of John and Robert Kennedy, 
  Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X and Yitzhak Rabin, all of whom were murdered 
  for their beliefs, or, rather, for the threat they posed to the established 
  interests. Even Nikita Khrushchev was removed from power in the then USSR in 
  1964 for trying to push his country towards a more peaceful coexistence with 
  the rest of the world. The threats these titans of history posed to the established 
  order of their day was not so much monetary as it was ideology. Each of them 
  planted in the minds of those who would listen the thought that the established 
  order of war, racism, poverty, and income and wealth disparity could and should 
  be questioned. However, those who pull the strings could not stand an ignorant 
  populace that questioned the order of things. And so their fate was, it seems, 
  preordained by disgruntled individuals agitated by those portions of business 
  and government who were wedded to the status quo. And so, JFK and Khrushchev, 
  King and RFK, and Malcolm X and Rubin were terminated and Americans, and the 
  world, found themselves at the mercy of Bush and Bin Laden, Hussein and Blair, 
  and Reagan and Sharon. <br>
</p>
<p>Crippled Opposition <br>
  With the election of Bush II in 2004, the ideological and economic fracturing 
  of America will be complete and, for the foreseeable future, permanent. The 
  three branches of the US government, corporations, and the majority of state's 
  governors and state houses will be controlled by those Republicans and Democrats 
  who have become indistinguishable in their belief that the government's only 
  role in America is to make it safe and ludicrously easy for small and large 
  corporations to make a profit without the drag of government regulations, programs 
  and taxes that, in their view, steal from the bottom line. With those folks 
  at thehelm, 2002 and 2003 saw the US federal and state governments give the 
  business community trillions of dollars of hand-outs in the form of tax cuts, 
  regulatory relief and legislation that allowed businesses to rape and pillage 
  the American landscape and its middle and lower classes. The latter group's 
  struggle is getting worse. Even as its industrial, service and information technology 
  jobs are exported to other countries, these Americans are being forced to work 
  longer hours, endure more expensive privatized health and welfare benefits, 
  and higher prices for feeding, clothing and educating their children. Slowly 
  but surely, Americans from the middle and lower classes find themselves at an 
  increasing distance from their rulers, yet must bear the burden of profit and 
  war for these same dastardly people. <br>
</p>
<p>But those that rule have in their malleable plebian audience a strange group 
  of middle and lower class acolytes. Among them, the notorious Christian right 
  and an estimated 5 to 9 million American-Muslims who handed Bush II over 90 
  percent of their vote in the last presidential election. That group, along with 
  neo-con Latinos and Asians, seem to have forgotten the struggles they waged 
  to reach, what once was, a republic with a semblance of representative democracy. 
  Are they trying to recreate the religious-military dictatorships of their own 
  home countries? Bush II certainly has obliged them in that effort. <br>
</p>
<p>The invincible political-corporate-state apparatus (PCS) that George Bush II 
  and his supporters have created will be opposed by a loose affiliation of hundred's 
  of local and urban communities-supported by a handful of wealthy donors, actors 
  and retired military personnel--who have refused to accept the destruction of 
  the federal and state governments, the Iraq War and the draconian Patriot Act 
  I and II, or, for that matter, the legitimacy of the Bush II presidency. But 
  the deck is stacked against them. <br>
  Catholics and Muslims of the World: Unite! <br>
</p>
<p>Thanks to the Patriot Act, elements of the Bush PCS can now enter the homes 
  of protestors that question opposition to the established order on the street, 
  the Internet, in high schools, on television, in the newspapers, and even in 
  common conversation. The Pentagon has its own domestic intelligence service 
  that has begun working with the FBI who, in turn, is ramping up its efforts 
  to build databases of Americans who oppose the Bush PCS machine. Even local 
  police, like the Miami Police Department, have become tools of the hideous juggernaut 
  that has been created by the powerful and paranoid of the land. The Miami Police 
  Department received $8.5 million from the $87.5 billion Pentagon appropriation 
  for the Iraq War. The $8.5 million from that Pentagon appropriation was used 
  for the defense of Miami against anti-globalization protestors in the same way 
  it is used by the US military to quell disturbances&gt; <br>
</p>
<p>And so the Bush-led PCS will continue to dress its god, its profits, its worldview 
  in the colorful and flammable costume that is patriotism. The rallying cries 
  are very persuasive to simple minds: Fight 'Em There Rather than Here! America 
  is Safer Now! The Economy is Recovering! Do Your Duty and Buy! Cheaper Oil and 
  Gas for Americans! Help Freedom Loving Iraqi's Rebuild! God Bless America! Go 
  Team! That same sort of infantile rationale will continue to be used to not 
  only further the economic and ideological divide in America, but to attack nations 
  who, coincidently, have large oil and gas reserves, sit in the path of energy 
  pipelines, or who happen to believe in Islam. But wait! The Catholic and oil 
  rich nations of Venezuela and Colombia find themselves targets of the Bush PCS. 
  Now there's a coincidence: Roman Catholics and Muslims the target of an Evangelical 
  Christian American government. Catholics and Muslims Unite! <br>
</p>
<p>2004-2008: Operation Clean Sweep <br>
  Shortly upon taking office in 2004, Bush's PCS will move rapidly on a number 
  of fronts. Unbound by the constraints of campaigning, the real work of the Bush 
  PCS will begin. First, the Bush PCS will continue to rupture federal and state 
  programs that assist the middle and lower classes of America and their culture 
  and environment. The US Supreme Court will eliminate a woman's right to choose. 
  Constitutional amendments banning gay rights, women's rights and civil rights/affirmative 
  action will be proposed by the Bush PCS and, in all likelihood, will succeed. 
  An additional amendment to the constitution concerning military rule in case 
  of an attack on US soil by any foreign individual or state will be added easing 
  the way towards military rule in America. <br>
</p>
<p>While the nation debates these issues, Bush will quietly issue an edict supporting 
  a return to the draft. The massive military campaign that is sure to follow 
  will require millions of US military personnel that can only be had forcibly 
  through conscription. As early as the Christian holiday of Christmas in December 
  2004, or more likely, the Christian Easter Holiday in April 2005 (celebrating 
  the resurrection of Jesus Christ), the Bush PCS will attack. Syria will be attacked 
  by American-British-Israeli coalition forces, primarily from its Western, Southern 
  and Eastern flanks. There will be no prolonged bombing campaign in this operation. 
  The air campaign will be concomitant with an amphibious assault on Syria's Western 
  shores, accompanied by a land invasion from the Southern and Eastern flanks. 
  The forces of the American led coalition will crush the dilapidated Syrian military 
  within 10 business days. <br>
</p>
<p>The Palestinians will likely be granted a piece of the former Syria and will 
  be relocated there by the US and Israel. <br>
  Simultaneously with invasion of Syria, Iran will be subjected to an extraordinary 
  air and cruise missile assault led by American forces. This operation will include 
  additional military elements from the Turkish and Afghani military who will 
  have been promised a piece of Iran once it is defeated. A withering air assault 
  will come from the Northwest through Turkey, from the West from US controlled 
  Iraq, from the East from the air bases in Afghanistan, and from carrier groups 
  and cruise missile launching submarines, to include an Israeli submarine, in 
  the Persian Gulf. Within 60 business days, Iran will be defeated by US-led forces. 
  And should Iran successfully test a nuclear weapon prior to that time, the Bush 
  PCS will accelerate its timetable for attack opting to use tactical nuclear 
  weapons to take out Iranian nuclear weaponry. <br>
</p>
<p>Since the Bush PCS believes that North Korea cannot be allowed to exist, it 
  will attack North Korea simultaneously with its invasion of Syria and Iran. 
  China will have been dealt with during back channel negotiations. The price 
  China will demand of not intervening against the US invasion (Chinese troop 
  strength at 100 million) will be Taiwan. The Bush PCS will turn a blind eye 
  to China's takeover of Taiwan, which had become a bad US hangover from the Cold 
  War. <br>
</p>
<p>The US will be glad to rid itself of support for Taiwan. Vladimir Putin may 
  sign on to the US-led invasion and commit Russian troops which will incur from 
  the Northeastern portion of North Korea's border. Participation with Bush in 
  this effort would allow Russia basing rights on the Eastern shores of North 
  Korea. The US and South Korean military will attempt to neutralize the North 
  Korean military with low yield tactical nuclear weapons which will be used primarily 
  along the heavily fortified Southern border. This conflict will see the massive 
  deployment of ordnance with calmative agents meant to literally put to sleep 
  the North Korean military. An electromagnetic pulse weapon or weapons will be 
  used to knock out North Korea's command and control infrastructure. Ground operations 
  will be simultaneous with air and sea assault but the conflict will rage on 
  for 12 business quarters as weather and terrain complicate the US led attack. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Colombia, US military forces will openly engage in combat against 
  the FARC and indigenous peoples movements there. Over in Venezuela, the US will 
  finally topple Hugo Chavez (if not prior to 2004). The aged leaders of Cuba 
  and Libya will be no match for the Bush PCS, and they will likely be toppled 
  in US led coups. In each of these cases, Bush PCS friendly dictators will be 
  installed and US corporations will quickly move to capitalize each of those 
  societies, just as they are doing in Iraq. <br>
</p>
<p>All of this, it seems, is a fait accompli. <br>
