<p align="center">THE PRECEPTS OF INIQUITY</p>
<p align="center">2 Peter, Chapter 2; the Book of Jude; 1 John 2:18,19.</p>
<p>A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. How is the hammer 
  of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation 
  among the nations!</p>
<p>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art taken, O Babylon, and thou wast 
  not aware: thou art found and also caught, because thou hast striven against 
  the Lord...(Jeremiah 50:22-24).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">AGAIN, THE DEVIL TAKETH HIM UP INTO AN EXCEEDING HIGH MOUNTAIN, 
  AND SHEWETH HIM ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD, AND THE GLORY OF THEM;</p>
<p align="left">And he saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou 
  wilt fall down and worship me.</p>
<p align="left">Then saith Jesus unto him, GET THEE HENCE, SATAN, FOR IT IS WRITTEN, 
  THOU SHALT WORSHIP THE LORD THY GOD, AND ONLY HIM SHALT THOU SERVE...(Matthew 
  4:8-10).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but 
  the just shall live by his faith.</p>
<p align="left">Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine (Daniel 5), HE IS A 
  PROUD MAN, NEITHER KEEPETH AT HOME, WHO ENLARGETH HIS DESIRE AS HELL, and is 
  as Death, and cannot be satisfied, BUT GATHERETH UNTO HIM ALL NATIONS, AND HEAPETH 
  UNTO HIM ALL PEOPLE:</p>
<p align="left">Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting 
  proverb against him,and say, WOE TO HIM THAT INCREASETH THAT WHICH IS NOT HIS! 
  how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay...(Habakkuk 2:1-6).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye 
  in him: <i>Rooted </i>and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye 
  have been taught, abounding therein in thanksgiving.</p>
<p align="left">BEWARE LEST ANY MAN SPOIL YOU THROUGH PHILOSOPHY AND VAIN DECEIT, 
  AFTER THE TRADITIONS OF MEN, AFTER THE RUDIMENTS OF THE WORLD, AND NOT AFTER 
  CHRIST...(Colossians 2:6-8).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in 
  his hand; AND HE SHALL MAGNIFY HIMSELF IN HIS HEART, AND BY PEACE SHALL DESTROY 
  (deceive) MANY: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he 
  shall be broken without hand...(Daniel 8:25).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, 
  whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the 
  gods of these nations; LEST THERE SHOULD BE AMONG YOU A ROOT THAT BEARETH GALL 
  AND WORMWOOD;</p>
<p align="left">AND IT COME TO PASS, WHEN HE HEARETH THE WORDS OF THIS CURSE, 
  THAT HE BLESS HIMSELF IN HIS HEART, SAYING, I SHALL HAVE PEACE, THOUGH I WALK 
  IN THE IMAGINATION OF MINE HEART, TO ADD DRUNKENNESS TO THIRST:</p>
<p align="left">The Lord will not spare him, but the anger of the Lord and his 
  jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in 
  the book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under 
  heaven...(Deuteronomy 29:18-21; Matthew5:17-19).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">CURSED BE HE WHO SPEAKS PEACE WITH HIS TONGUE, WHILE IN HIS HEART 
  IS NOT PEACE BUT A SWORD...FOR ALL THINGS SHALL BE LAID BARE IN THE WEIGHING 
  SCALES ON THE GREAT JUDGMENT DAY...(Secrets of Enoch LII).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">THE WORDS OF HIS MOUTH WERE SMOOTHER THAN BUTTER, BUT WAR WAS 
  IN HIS HEART. HIS WORDS WERE SOFTER THAN OIL, YET WERE THEY DRAWN SWORDS...(Psalm 
  55:21)</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they 
  sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye have fellowship 
  with devils.</p>
<p align="left">YE CANNOT DRINK THE CUP OF THE LORD, AND THE CUP OF DEVILS: YE 
  CANNOT BE PARTAKERS OF THE LORD'S TABLE, AND THE TABLE OF DEVILS.</p>
<p align="left">DO WE PROVOKE THE LORD TO JEALOUSY? ARE WE STRONGER THAN HE?...(1 
  Corinthians 10:20-22).</p>
<p align="left">A double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways...(James 1:8).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">Know this that in the last days perilous times shall come. For 
  men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, 
  disobedient to <i>Parents</i>, unthankful, unholy. Without natural affection, 
  trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that 
  are good. Traitors, heady, <i>highminded</i>, lovers of pleasures more than 
  lovers of God;</p>
<p align="left">HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT DENYING THE POWER THEREOF: from 
  such turn away...(2 Timothy 3:1-5).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
  who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; PREACH 
  THE WORD; be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with 
  all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>
<p align="left">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; 
  but after their own lusts shall they heap unto themselves TEACHERS HAVING ITCHIING 
  EARS...(2 Timothy 4:1-3; 1 Samuel 3:10-14). (Of course read 1 Samuel 2:1-10).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and 
  have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost. 
  And have tasted the good word of God, AND THE POWERS OF THE WORLD TO COME,</p>
<p align="left">IF THEY SHALL FALL AWAY, to renew them again unto repentance; 
  seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open 
  shame. </p>
<p align="left">For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon 
  it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth 
  blessing from God:</p>
<p align="left">BUT THAT WHICH BEARETH THORNS AND BRIARS IS REJECTED, and is nigh 
  unto cursing; whose end is to be burned...(Hebrews 6:1-8; Matthew 13:7,22).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">THE CARNAL MIND...(Romans 8:1-11; James, chapters 4 and 5).</p>
<p align="left">And ye hath He quickened which was dead...Wherein in times past 
  ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the Prince of 
  the Power of the Air, the spirit that now worketh in all the children of disobedience...(Ephesians 
  2:1-6)</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">Ye were sometimes Darkness, but now are ye Light in the Lord: 
  walk as children of Light...AND HAVE NO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE UNFRUITFUL WORKS 
  OF DARKNESS, but rather reprove them...</p>
<p align="left">Wherefore he saith, AWAKE thou that sleepest, AND ARISE FROM THE 
  DEAD, and Christ shall give thee Light...(Eph.5:8-17; Matthew 7:13-20; 1 Cor.4:5; 
  John 3:19-21).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">Would to God ye would bear with me a little in my folly; <i>and 
  indeed bear with with me</i>. For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: 
  FOR I HAVE ESPOUSED YOU TO ONE HUSBAND, THAT I MAY PRESENT YOU AS A CHASTE VIRGIN 
  TO CHRIST,</p>
<p align="left">But I fear, lest by any means, as the Serpent beguiled Eve through 
  his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is 
  in Christ.</p>
<p align="left">FOR IF HE THAT COMETH PREACHETH ANOTHER JESUS, WHOM WE HAVE NOT 
  PREACHED, OR IF YE RECEIVE ANOTHER ANOTHER SPIRIT, WHICH YE HAVE NOT RECEIVED 
  (from us), OR ANOTHER GOSPEL, WHICH YE HAVE NOT (previously) ACCEPTED, YE MIGHT 
  WELL BEAR WITH HIM...</p>
<p align="left">For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves 
  into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed 
  into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also 
  be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according 
  to their works...(2 Corinthians 11:1-4, 13-15).</p>
<p align="left">This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth 
  walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, Having the understanding 
  darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is 
  in them, because of the blindness of their heart...(Ephesians 4:17,18).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, 
  we faint not. BUT WE HAVE RENOUNCED THE HIDDEN THINGS OF DISHONESTY, NOT WALKING 
  IN CRAFTINESS, NOR HANDLING THE WORD OF GOD DECEITFULLY...</p>
<p align="left">But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid from them that are lost: In 
  whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, 
  lest the Light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should 
  shine unto them. FOR WE PREACH NOT OURSELVES, BUT (the mystery of) CHRIST JESUS 
  THE LORD; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</p>
<p align="left">For God, who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath 
  shined in our hearts, to give the Light of the knowledge of the Glory of God 
  in the Face of Jesus Christ...(2 Corinthians 4:1-6).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, 
  even of your lusts that war in your members? Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, 
  and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not because 
  ye ask not. Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume 
  it upon your lusts.</p>
<p align="left">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, KNOW YE NOT THAT FRIENDSHIP WITH 
  (THIS) WORLD IS ENMITY WITH OD? WHOSOEVER THEREFORE WILL BE A FRIEND OF THE 
  WORLD IS THE ENEMY OF GOD...Wherefore he saith, <i>God resisteth the proud, 
  </i>but giveth grace to the humble...(James 4:1-6).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">I receive not honor from men. But I know you, that ye have not 
  the love of God in you.</p>
<p align="left">I am come in my Father's Name, and ye receive me not: IF ANOTHER 
  SHALL COME IN HIS OWN NAME, HIM YE WILL RECEIVE. HOW CAN YE BELIEVE, WHICH RECEIVETH 
  HONOUR ONE FROM ANOTHER, AND SEEK NOT THE HONOUR THAT COMETH FROM GOD ALONE...(John 
  5:39-47).</p>
<p align="left">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether 
  they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</p>
<p align="left">Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: EVERY SPIRIT THAT CONFESSETH 
  THAT JESUS <i>IS</i> COME IN THE FLESH IS OF GOD. </p>
<p align="left">AND EVERY SPIRIT THAT CONFESSETH NOT THAT JESUS CHRIST <i>IS COME 
  IN THE FLESH</i> IS NOT OF GOD: and that is that spirit of ANTICHRIST, whereof 
  ye have heard that it should come; and even now already it is in the world...</p>
<p align="left">THEY ARE OF THE WORLD, THEREFORE SPEAK THEY OF (this) WORLD, AND 
  THE WORLD HEARETH THEM...(1 John 4:1-6).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">FOR THEY ARE ENEMIES OF THE CROSS WHO MIND EARTHLY THINGS...for 
  our conversation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Savior the Lord...(Philippians 
  3:16-20; Isaiah 66:15-17; 2 Thessalonians, chapter 1 and 2).</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p align="left">The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips, but the 
  just shall come out of trouble...(Proverbs 12:13). </p>
<p align="left">As the palate tsteth diverse kinds of meat, so does the heart 
  of understanding false speech...(Ecclesisticus 36:19).</p>
<p align="center">NOW IS THE PRINCE OF THIS WORLD JUDGED...(John 16:7-15).</p>
