<p align="center">New Hubble Images Show Deepest View of Universe, Scientists 
  Say<br>

  ALTIMORE, March 9 &#151; Like Moses being led to the mountain to see the Promised 
  Land he would never visit, the Hubble Space Telescope has now seen to within 
  &quot;a stone's throw&quot; of the Big Bang itself, astronomers said today.</p>
<p>In a ceremony here that was part science workshop, part political rally and 
  part starting gun for an astronomical gold rush, astronomers at the Space Telescope 
  Science Institute on the Johns Hopkins University campus unveiled what they 
  said was the deepest telescopic view into the universe that humankind had ever 
  obtained.</p>
<p>Among the roughly 10,000 new galaxies revealed by a million-second exposure 
  of a small patch of dark sky in the constellation Fornax are several dozen faint 
  reddish spots that could be infant galaxies just emerging from the &quot;dark 
  ages&quot; that prevailed in the first half-billion years after the Big Bang, 
  when stars had not yet had time to form, the astronomers said. </p>
<p>&quot;We might have seen the end of the beginning,&quot; said Dr. Anton Koekenoer 
  of the institute. He and others cautioned, however, that more work would be 
  required before astronomers know if their surmises are correct.</p>
<p>Today's look at the universe will not be superseded until the James Webb Space 
  Telescope goes into orbit in 2011. When the new image, known officially as the 
  Hubble Ultra Deep Field, has been analyzed, said Dr. Steven Beckwith, the director 
  of the Space Telescope Science Institute, &quot;we expect it to reveal new secrets 
  to the origin of stars and galaxies, and ultimately ourselves.&quot; </p>
<p>The first bits of that work began with a frenzy today, when the institute simultaneously 
  unveiled the images and made the raw data available to the entire world at hubblesite.org. 
</p>
<p>Before today, Dr. Beckwith said, only four people had seen the image and they 
  had pledged among themselves not to work on it ahead of time, so as not to give 
  the &quot;home team&quot; an advantage. &quot;I wanted it to be like the great 
  land rush where the gun is fired and everybody takes off,&quot; Dr. Beckwith 
  said.</p>
<p>The occasion also served as a reminder of the plight of the Hubble telescope, 
  which is operating under a controversial death sentence. Since 1990, it has 
  floated above the Earth's murky atmosphere, providing astronomers with peerless 
  views of the heavens, with the help of periodic refurbishments by astronauts. 
</p>
<p>But on Jan. 17, just a day after the Hubble had completed its marathon squint, 
  NASA's administrator, Sean O'Keefe, said any space shuttle missions to the telescope 
  would be too unsafe and canceled them, dooming the Hubble to die a lingering 
  death in orbit within three years. The decision set off an outcry among scientists, 
  the public and on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>In response to a protest by Sen. Barbara Milulski, Democrat of Maryland, the 
  home of the space telescope, Mr. O'Keefe agreed to get a &quot;second opinion&quot; 
  from Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., who was chairman of an investigation into the 
  loss of the shuttle Columbia last year. His response is expected soon.</p>
<p>Last week, Representative Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, and seven colleagues 
  introduced a resolution in the House Science Committee calling on NASA to establish 
  an independent panel to study the question.</p>
<p>The astronomers denied that today's event was timed to capitalize on the uproar 
  over Hubble, but Senator Mikulski walked in unannounced to the telescope institute 
  today, garnering applause, and then helped pull the curtain to unveil the new 
  picture. She said in a short speech that she would not stop her efforts to save 
  the Hubble after Admiral Gehman's opinion was delivered.</p>
<p>&quot;The future of the Hubble,&quot; she said, &quot;should not be decided 
  by one man in a NASA back room without a transparent process.&quot; </p>
