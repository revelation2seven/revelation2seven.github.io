<div align="center">JIMMY CARTER EXPLAINS HOW THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT ISN'T CHRISTIAN 
  AT ALL. <br>
  By Ayelish McGarvey<br>
  Web Exclusive: 04.05.04 </div>
<p>Former President Jimmy Carter, AMERICA'S FIRST EVANGELICAL PRESIDENT, still 
  teaches Sunday school at his Baptist church in Plains, Georgia, and he and his 
  wife, Rosalynn, continue their human-rights work in developing nations through 
  the Carter Center at Emory University. In recent months, the Carters toured 
  Togo, Ghana, and Mali to raise awareness of the public-health needs of those 
  nations. In February, Carter spoke about the role of evangelical Christianity 
  in democratic politics with Prospect writing fellow Ayelish McGarvey. </p>
<p><b>Republicans have been extremely successful at connecting religion and values 
  to issues like the fight against terrorism, abortion, and gay rights. Democrats 
  have been far less adept at infusing our issues -- compassion, help for the 
  poor, social justice -- with any sense of religious commitment or moral imperative. 
  Why do you think that is? </b></p>
<p>&quot;When I was younger, ALMOST ALL BAPTISTS WERE STRONGLY COMMITTED ON A 
  THELOGICAL BASIS TO THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b>WHAT DOES CARTER MEAN BY &quot;SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND 
    STATE?&quot; THE SAME AS MOSES MEANT? THE SAME AS PAUL (2 Corinthians 6:14-18; 
    2 Corinthians 11:1-15; Revelation 18...KJV)?</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>...It was only 25 years ago when there began to be a melding of the Republican 
  Party with fundamentalist Christianity, particularly with the Southern Baptist 
  Convention. This is a fairly new development, AND I THINK IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT 
  BY THE ABANDONMENT OF SOME OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIANITY. </p>
<p>FIRST OF ALL, WE WORSHIP THE PRINCE OF PEACE, NOT WAR. And those of us who 
  have advocated for the resolution of international conflict in a peaceful fashion 
  are looked upon as being unpatriotic, branded that way by right-wing religious 
  groups, the Bush administration, and other Republicans...</p>
<p>Secondly, Christ was committed to compassion for the most destitute, poor, 
  needy, and forgotten people in our society. Today there is a stark difference 
  [between conservative ideology and Christian teaching] because most of the people 
  most strongly committed to the Republican philosophy have adopted the proposition 
  that help for the rich is the best way to help even poor people (by letting 
  some of the financial benefits drip down to those most deeply in need). I would 
  say there has been a schism drawn -- on theology and practical politics and 
  economics--between the two groups.&quot; </p>
<p><font size="+1">Carter, of course, is correct here on this issue...but in his 
  own entangled, <i>liberal, </i>and (supra)nationalistic<i> </i> kind of way. 
  It should be completely evident to those who continue to walk in the precepts 
  and teachings of Christ, that the great man is as selective in his application 
  of Biblical principles, and as <i>partial in the law</i>, as the Religious Right. 
  He speaks of &quot;separation,&quot; but he is not separate...</font></p>

<p><b>What has attracted conservative Christians to a party that protects corporate 
  interests and promotes an aggressive foreign-policy agenda? How do those square? 
  </b></p>
<p>&quot;There is an element of fundamentalism involved, which involves the belief 
  on the part of a human being that [his or her] own concept of God is the proper 
  one. And since [he or she has] the proper concept of God, [he or she is] particularly 
  blessed and singled out for special consideration above and beyond those who 
  disagree with [him or her]. </p>
<p>&quot;Secondly, anyone who does disagree with [him or her], since [he or she 
  is] harnessed to God in a unique way, then, by definition, must be wrong. And 
  the second step is if you are in disagreement with [his or her] concept of the 
  way to worship, even among the Christian community, is that you are inferior 
  to [him or her]. And then the ultimate progression of that is that you&#146;re 
  not only different and wrong and inferior but in some ways you are subhuman. 
  So there&#146;s a loss of concern even for the death of those who disagree. 
  And this takes fundamentalism to the extreme. This is an element of the fundamentalist 
  cause in this country. If you are a wealthy white man, then you are naturally 
  inclined to think that the poor are inferior and don&#146;t deserve your first 
  consideration. If you are a wealthy white man, then you also take on the proposition 
  that women are inherently inferior. This builds up a sense of prejudice and 
  alienation that permeates the Christian right during these days.&quot; </p>
<p><b>What issues do you see galvanizing moderate evangelicals as they go to the 
  polls in November? </b></p>
<p>&quot;I&#146;VE BEEN INVOLVED IN NATIONAL POLITICS NOW FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS. 
  But this year we will see the Democratic Party more united than ever before 
  in my memory, and even the earlier history that I studied before my life began. 
  I think we&#146;re completely united with a determination to replace the Bush 
  administration and its fundamentalist, right-wing philosophy with the more moderate 
  qualities that have always exemplified what our nation is: A NATION COMMITTED 
  TO STRENGTH IN THE MILITARY. I served longer in the military than any other 
  president since the Civil War except Dwight Eisenhower. I was a submarine officer. 
  I USED THE ENORMOUS AND UNMATCHED STRENGTH OF AMERICA TO PROMOTE PEACE FOR OTHER 
  PEOPLE AND PRESERVE PEACE FOR OURSELVES. </p>
<p>&quot;Now it seems as though it is an attractive thing in Washington to resort 
  to war in the very early stage of resolving an altercation; a completely unnecessary 
  war that President Bush decided to launch against the Iraqis is an example of 
  that. And I think that a reaction against that warlike attitude on the part 
  of America to the exclusion of almost all other nations in the world -- and 
  arousing fear in them -- is going to be a driving issue. </p>
<p>&quot;I think that the abandonment of environmental issues even endorsed by 
  President Nixon when I was governor (as well as virtually all of the Republicans 
  and Democrats) has been notable under the Bush administration. ONE OF THE THINGS 
  I LEARNED AS A YOUNG BAPTIST BOY WAS TO BE A STEWARD OF THE WORLD GOD BLESSED 
  US TO ENJOY. And I think the abandonment of basic environmental standards by 
  the Bush administration rallies us... </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Rallies us to what? The obscene practice of strip mining did not cease 
    under Carter's stewardship of the environment, but continued unabated until, 
    at last, one a man's final assaults on Nature Herself--full scale mountain 
    top removal...(Revelation 11:18...KJV).</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;And I think the third thing is the obvious orientation of the Bush administration 
  toward Halliburton, Enron, and other major corporations. You see this in the 
  enormous tax reductions that have been granted to people that make more than 
  $200,000 a year. That is another issue on which the Democrats will rally a common 
  goal. </p>
<p><b>Do you think that Democrats will be able to attract Bible-believing Christians 
  in a year that gay marriage will be used as a smokescreen to distract attention 
  from those issues? </b></p>
<p>&quot;I think so. There isn&#146;t a major candidate who has endorsed gay marriage; 
  they are in favor of equal protection through a civil-union arrangement. I personally, 
  in my Sunday-school lessons, don&#146;t favor the religious endorsement of a 
  gay marriage. But I do favor equal treatment under the law for people who differ 
  from me in sexual orientation. </p>
<p><b>What about abortion? How would you speak to moderate evangelicals who withhold 
  support for Democratic candidates on that single issue? </b></p>
<p>&quot;This was an issue that I had to face when I was campaigning 25 years 
  ago. I have always been against abortion; it&#146;s not possible for me in my 
  own concept of Christ to believe that Jesus would favor abortion. But at the 
  same time, I have supported the Supreme Court ruling of our country as the law 
  of the land. And the present arrangement, whereby a woman is authorized to have 
  an abortion in the first trimester of the pregnancy, or when the pregnancy is 
  caused by rape or incest -- these are the things that moderates who have beliefs 
  like mine can accept as the present circumstances in our country. The liberality 
  of abortion is anointed by the laws of our country, including the ultimate ruling 
  of the Supreme Court. </p>

  9:6; 66:6-10; 1 Thessalonians 5:1-9). </font></p>
<p><b>How do you think the fundamentalist Christian right has misrepresented Christianity, 
  as well as the democratic process? </b></p>
<p>&quot;Well, what do Christians stand for, based exclusively on the words and 
  actions of Jesus Christ? We worship him as a prince of peace. And I think almost 
  all Christians would conclude that whenever there is an inevitable altercation 
  -- say, between a husband and a wife, or a father and a child, or within a given 
  community, or between two nations (including our own) -- we should make every 
  effort to resolve those differences which arise in life through peaceful means. 
  Therein, we should not resort to war as a way to exalt the president as the 
  commander in chief. A commitment to peace is certainly a Christian principle 
  that even ultraconservatives would endorse, AT LEAST BY WORSHIPPING THE PRINCE 
  OF PEACE... </p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/FeetOfThem1.gif" width="678" height="450"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Hebrews 12:25-29.</b></p>
<p>&quot;And Christ reached out almost exclusively to the poor, suffering, abandoned, 
  deprived -- the scorned, the condemned people -- including Samaritans and those 
  who were diseased. The alleviation of suffering was a philosophy that was enhanced 
  and emphasized by the life of Christ. Today the ultra-right wing, IN BOTH RELIGION 
  AND POLITICS, has abandoned that principle of Jesus Christ&#146;s ministry. 
</p>
<p>&quot;Those are the two principal things in the practical sense that starkly 
  separate the ultra-right Christian community from the rest of the Christian 
  world: Do we endorse and support peace and support the alleviation of suffering 
  among the poor and the outcast? </p>
<p><b>You spent so much of your career working toward a reasonable, peaceful solution 
  to violence and strife in Israel and Palestine. Increasing attention has been 
  paid to traditionalist evangelicals&#146; strong support for Israel, based on 
  the New Testament prophecy that the reconstruction of the ancient kingdom of 
  David will usher in the &#147;end times&#148; and the Second Coming of Christ. 
  As a believer and a peacemaker, how do you respond to this? </b></p>
<p>&quot;That&#146;s a completely foolish and erroneous interpretation of the 
  Scriptures. And it has resulted in these last few years with a terrible, very 
  costly, and bloody deterioration in the relationship between Israel and its 
  neighbors. Every president except for George W. Bush has taken a relatively 
  balanced position between the Israelis and their enemies, always strongly supporting 
  Israel but recognizing that you have to negotiate and work between Israel and 
  her neighbors in order to bring about a peaceful resolution. </p>
<p>&quot;It&#146;s nearly the 25th anniversary of my consummation of a treaty 
  between Israel and Egypt -- not a word of which has ever been violated. But 
  this administration, maybe strongly influenced by ill-advised theologians of 
  the extreme religious right, has pretty well abandoned any real effort that 
  could lead to a resolution of the problems between Israel and the Palestinians. 
  And no one can challenge me on my commitment to Israel and its right to live 
  in peace with all its neighbors. But at the same time, there has to be a negotiated 
  settlement; you can&#146;t just ordain the destruction of the Palestinian people, 
  and their community and their political entity, in favor of the Israelis. And 
  that&#146;s what some of the extreme fundamentalist Christians have done, both 
  to the detriment of the Israelis and the Palestinians. </p>
