<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Yigael Yadin</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Dead Sea Scrolls are without 
    doubt one of the most important discoveries, if not 'the' most important discovery, 
    for biblical studies ever made in the Holy Land. Their discovery created shock 
    waves among scholars. To change the metaphor, it was if a powerful telescope 
    with a zoom lens suddenly brought the world of Judaism at the end of the Second 
    Temple period into immediate focus across a barrier of two thousand years. 
    This period was both a tragic turning point in Jewish history--the Romans 
    destroyed the temple in 70 AD--and the cradle in which Christianity was born 
    and began to grow. The Temple Scroll, like the previously discovered Dead 
    Sea Scrolls, will no doubt be scrutinized by generations of scholars in order 
    to illuminate this critical period in the history of Judaism as well as Christianity...</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><i>From the rising of the Sun, even unto the going down of 
    the same my Name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense 
    shall be offered unto my Name, and a pure offering; for my Name shall be great 
    among them, saith the Lord...</i>(Malachi 1:11).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I previously referred to the many 
    &quot;new&quot; or additional festivals referred to in the Temple Scroll. 
    These were observed by the Essenes but not by normative Jews. One of these 
    additional festivals I did not mention was THE ANNUAL SEVEN-DAY CELEBRATION 
    know as THE DAY OF ORDINATION (or consecration) of the Priests. This celebration 
    is patterned on the Seven-day consecration ceremony Moses performed on Aaron 
    and his sons when they became priests of the Lord in the wilderness, as described 
    in Leviticus 8. For normative Judaism, this ordination of the priests was 
    a onetime act...For the Essenes, who ruled by the Temple Scroll, however, 
    this was a Yearly ceremony. It was to be performed annually, forever...The 
    role of Moses was to be taken by the High Priest </font>(see Hebrews, chapters 
    5, and 6)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. When the High Priest 
    himself was to be consecrated, the role of Moses was to be performed by the 
    elders </font>(see Revelation, chapter 4)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Baptism as we know it in early 
    Christianity may have been adopted under Essene influence through John the 
    Baptist. But the most often noted similarities between Christian and Essene 
    doctrine...are to be found in the Pauline Epistles and in the Johannine literature. 
    How do we explain these similarities--such things as the dualism found in 
    both the New Testament and in the writings of the Dead Sea sect, the contrast 
    between the Sons of Darkness and the Sons of Light...the spirit and the flesh, 
    good and evil? The communal meal is also something we find in early Christianity 
    and in the Dead Sea sect. It is my belief that these similarities came through 
    Paul...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul became the Apostle to the 
    Gentiles </font>(Please consider Chapter 8, entitled Paul, Elisha ben Abuyah)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    He was attempting insofar as possible to avoid the burdens of the Mosaic law 
    for those whom he converted and who found the law an obstacle to their new 
    allegiance...I think he found a ready-made theology in many respects in the 
    doctrines of the Essenes. FOR THE ESSENES, LIKE THE EARLY CHRISTIANS...REJECTED 
    THE JERUSALEM TEMPLE AND ITS CULT: In my view, the striking similarities between 
    early Christianity and the doctrines of the Essenes entered Christianity after 
    Jesus' time via Paul in the period before the Romans destroyed the Jerusalem 
    Temple in 70 AD.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet there is a paradox here: How 
    can it be that a sect of Essenes that adhered so tenaciously to the strictest 
    and most legalistic interpretation of all the minutiae of the Law of Moses 
    as prescribed in the Torah could influence--of all sects--the one (Christianity) 
    that in due course essentially rejected this Law, especially those parts of 
    the Law concerned with Temple observance and ritual purity?</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The author is entering unknown (hidden) territory here. He 
  knows nothing (of course) of the universal dimensions, or of the historical 
  structure of the World Tree, or of the whereabouts of the City Above (Isaiah, 
  chapters 27 to 29). He does not realize how that fellowship of Essenes--who 
  were indoctrinated into the mysteries of Jehoshua (YHWH - YHShWH), an element 
  of the esoteric doctrines of the Metatron, the Angel of Divine Presence (Exodus 
  23:20-23; 24:10), by John the Baptist--were already present at that place when 
  Paul appeared on the world scene. (Acts 7:58). Or how--after a long time spent 
  on the details of his own revelation--Paul returned to the Essenes with his 
  theology of the Christ Mystery (rooted firmly in the Law and the Prophets) all 
  worked out to everyone's further understanding and satisfaction. The agreement 
  between them is reflected, quite cryptically to be sure, in the various Gospel 
  narratives that began to appear in the years afterwards.</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>(Yigael Yadin continues)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The 
    complete answer is no doubt more complicated than the following hesitant outline 
    suggests...As I have said, the early Christians came into contact with the 
    Essenes and were influenced by them at a time late in Essene history (first 
    century AD). They met Essenes who maintained their own calendar and repudiated 
    the Jerusalem Temple as well as its laws...Thus bereft of a legitimate temple, 
    the Essenes developed a theology and religious practice that enabled them 
    to live without this cultic institution, especially at their own monastic 
    centers such as Qumran in the wilderness. The following paraphrase of Proverbs 
    15:8 from an Essene document could have appealed to circles of Pauline or 
    Johannine Christianity: :The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, but 
    the prayer of the just is an agreeable offering.&quot; (Damascus Document 
    11:20-21)...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the Essenes, however, the rejection 
    of the Temple was &quot;temporary.&quot; For them, the Jerusalem priests were 
    illegitimate and the Temple polluted because their own rigid interpretations 
    of the Law were not applied; EVEN ITS PLAN WAS A WRONG ONE. For the Essenes, 
    the temporary, substitute way of life was applicable only until &quot;the 
    exiles of the Sons of Light return from the Wilderness of the Nations to encamp 
    in the Wilderness of Jerusalem. (War Scroll 3). </font>(see 1 Peter 2:1-9)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Yadin, not seeing how this great synchronization took place, 
  between the Essenes, the pharisaic Paul (Elisha ben Abuyah) and the followers 
  of those European Druids who went on to form the primary structure of the early 
  Christian church, goes on to say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What was a temporary substitute 
    for the Essenes, Christianity adopted as a permanent theology, part of their 
    fixed and final canon. In short, what was for the Essenes an ad hoc adaptation 
    to their rejection of the Jerusalem priesthood and Temple, APPLICABLE ONLY 
    TO THE END OF DAYS WHEN THE TEMPLE WOULD BE REBUILT BY GOD ACCORDING TO THEIR 
    OWN BELIEFS, became for Christianity a permanent solution. Let me conclude 
    simply with a few puzzles in the history of Christianity for which the Temple 
    Scroll might provide a hint of a solution.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, even before the acquisition 
    of the Temple Scroll, we knew about the SOLAR CALENDAR used by the Essenes, 
    which contrasted with the Lunar calendar practiced by normative Judaism. </font>(Yes, 
    but not really...Please see the chapter entitled The Sun and Moon, Christianity 
    and Judaism)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. The Essenes' Solar 
    calendar was divided into Four sections consisting of three thirty-day months, 
    plus one additional day. Thus the Essene year contained 364 days, divided 
    into TWELVE THIRTY-DAY MONTHS, plus four intercalated days inserted at the 
    end of each three-month group. </font>(This was for keeping with the calculations 
    of the years and seasons, and the times and half-times in the Book of Daniel. 
    Yadin continues)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">: (In the course 
    of years, this calendar would need additional intercalated days--or leap years--to 
    maintain the same seasons, but we have no information, for the time being, 
    on how the Essenes did this). Using this calendar, however, results in holidays 
    always falling on the same day of the week.</font></p>

  or the gates and the levels (the Fifteen steps) leading into the Holy Place, 
  with the Universal Mandala situated at the center of the World Tree, or with 
  the like-description of it in the Book of Ezekiel (chapters 40 to 48). Neither 
  are describing a Temple that can be layed out, or literally built with human 
  hands. Nor will he will equate the three courts, the Outer, Middle, and Inner, 
  with the gates of initiation every human soul must pass through in its pathway 
  to spiritual perfection--corresponding to the physical, or natural state of 
  mind that governs every soul who is sojourning in the outer courts of spiritual 
  reality; and then the intellectual, or philosophical realm which facilitates 
  the soul's passage from the lower (outer realm) to a higher state of consciousness; 
  and finally to the inner, or spiritual state of mind itself, where one (if one 
  is called to it) is allowed entrance into the court of the priests of Israel 
  (the stewards of the World Mystery). It is in this court, where the mysteries 
  of the Tree of Life have been preserved, and where the Mind of God and the mind

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IN THE TEMPLE SCROLL</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Magen Broshi</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the previous chapter Yigael 
    Yadin described the contents of the Temple Scroll. I would like to make one 
    additional point relating to the size of the temple envisioned in it. Of five 
    major subjects dealt with in the scroll, the foremost is the temple, its design 
    and the ordinances pertaining to it. This subject occupies almost half the 
    length of the scroll; hence the name Yadin gave to the scroll (the original 
    name is unknown).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The temple compound as described 
    in the scroll consists of three concentric square courts--the inner court, 
    the middle, and the outer. In the midst of the inner court would stand the 
    temple and the various buildings connected with it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CLEARLY THIS WAS NOT THE TEMPLE 
    WHEN THE SCROLL WAS WRITTEN. Although the date of the scroll's composition 
    is still an open question it was certainly composed at least a century before 
    Herod the Great began rebuilding the Temple at the end of the first century 
    B.C.. THE TEMPLE DESCRIBED IN THE SCROLL OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT REFER TO THE TEMPLE 
    THAT EXISTED IN HEROD'S TIME. </font>(Brosni will also take the Scroll literally, 
    and says):<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Nor does it refer to 
    the temple to be built by the Lord at the end of days. Instead it refers to 
    a man-made edifice, to be constructed on terra-firma according to the author's 
    own conception. As would be the case with Herod's temple, the greater effort 
    was to be expended on the temple courts.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/OldCity.gif" width="546" height="544"></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>The author says: (The exact size of the cubit referred to in the scroll 
        is, unfortunately, unknown to us. I have assumed, somewhat arbitrarily, 
        that the cubit is 0.5 meter or 19.7 inches long, which is 10 to 15 percent 
        longer or shorter than the length of the cubit according to various scholars...Chapter 
        8, note 4, p.297).</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By comparison with the temple described 
    in the Temple Scroll, the Herodian Temple was a miniature. Let us look at 
    the size of the gigantic temple compound described in the Temple Scroll.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The square outer court would be 
    sixteen hundred cubits on a side. </font>(Compare Revelation 21, and Rev.14:20)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    This is about twenty-five hundred feet, or half a mile, on a side. </font>(How 
    many straight miles is it from Jerusalem to Vienna)?<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...In 
    comparison, Herod's temple compound (which was the largest artificial esplanade 
    in antiquity) was only about a quarter as big. In addition, the temple described 
    in the Temple Scroll would be surrounded my a moat (necessitating a water 
    ritual, or baptism) 100 cubits wide, (or 10 X 10). The total area of the temple 
    compound described in the Temple Scroll was, coincidentally, precisely the 
    size of Jerusalem in the second century B.C...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To build the complex described 
    in the Temple Scroll would require solving serious topographical problems. 
    Creating a level space on which to build this gigantic project would require 
    as much work as the building project itself. Leveling the ground would require 
    filling in the Kidron Valley (to raise it about 250 feet) on the east and 
    quarrying rock on the west. This would have meant removal of millions of tons 
    of soil and rock, all by human muscle. A feasible feat, I suppose, but extremely 
    impractical. But, after all, practicality was not the Dead Sea sect's forte.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Spirit in man which sees the 
    Logos is the most individualized form of the Godhead. It is what human beings 
    have most in common with each other and is thus what can unite them, now that, 
    after thousands of years of isolation, they are free. The waves of the creative 
    (higher) World must ebb in &quot;this&quot; world, AND THE LOGOS ITSELF MUST 
    DIE IN THIS WORLD AND DIE FOR IT...The history of the world and the history 
    of consciousness are one and the same. Insofar as the Christ-spirit in man, 
    the one who comes from above, acts in the body, the living thought must die 
    at the end of the process of consciousness. But the kernel of human consciousness, 
    coming from above, still lives in darkness, as if asleep...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To become aware of the Godhead 
    in a human body presented the greatest difficulty for the members of the Chosen 
    People. As a people, they did not understand what played out before their 
    eyes, although their entire history was a preparation for it. </font>(The 
    same will be true for Jews and Christians in our own time)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    No people could have understood it; ONLY INDIVIDUALS COULD HAVE MORE OR LESS 
    GRASPED IT. To understand it is a completely individual act, for which membership 
    in a people or a community is no help. </font>(Understand 2 Corinthians 12:1-4 
    in this light)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. One may even suspect 
    that the Chosen People as a whole had to fail since had they understood, the 
    death of the Logos-bearer would not have occurred and all the possibilities 
    for human development brought about by his death would be lacking. For this 
    death to occur, an individual as well as a community had to cooperate.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This people had earned the One, 
    the Invisible. He is a special God, the one who addresses the man, Moses, 
    at whose request he speaks his Name. He chooses his people and desires to 
    dwell in them: &quot;AND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY; THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG 
    THEM&quot; (Exodus 25:8). More precisely, it is written of Solomon' Temple: 
    &quot;THEN THERE SHALL BE A PLACE WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD SHALL CHOOSE TO 
    CAUSE HIS NAME TO DWELL THERE.&quot; (Deut.12:11; compare Deut.14:23 and 1

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the descent of the Godhead 
    among men: first, the moveable tabernacle of God; then the sanctuary in Jerusalem, 
    wherein dwells the invisible One, his Name. Therefore it is all too easy to 
    understand that it is experienced as blasphemy when the Godhead now appears 
    in human form, in a human body. But the Chosen People do not recognize the 
    Name in this form...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Man is already God in that God's 
    Word speaks to him, (and through him). But, for the Jews, God lives in Solomon's 
    Temple. With regard to this, the Logos-bearer announces...&quot;The hour cometh, 
    when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the 
    Father...But the hour cometh, AND NOW IS, when the true worshippers shall 
    worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to 
    worship him. God is a spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit 
    and in truth.&quot; (John 4:21-24)...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly a new form of worship is 
    being prepared. The destruction of the sanctuary in Jerusalem--predicted by 
    the Logos-bearer--occurs in accordance with this. At the same time the theme 
    of the destruction of the temple is connected with the destruction of the 
    human body, which--according to the words of the Logos-bearer--can be raised 
    up again in Three Days...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THAT BODY AND SANCTUARY, AS ALSO

    sheath that separates him from his various surroundings, thereby making cognition 
    possible on every level. &quot;In this world&quot; the physical body is the

    in men in its third form. Dwelling means that a person affirms the fact that 
    he is chosen; for in the Age of the Spirit all men are chosen, otherwise the 
    spirit would merely flare up within and turn against itself and against man, 
    driving him unwittingly into a suicidal stance in which he would deny his 
    humanity, (and) his spiritual being...The latter (actually former) texts of 
    the New Testament describe the Spirit's dwelling in its new sanctuary more 
    thoroughly. The Acts of the Apostles tells of the &quot;miraculous&quot; event 
    of Pentecost, but does so in the full light of consciousness; the Epistles 
    and the Apocalypse tell of the New Temple. &quot;Know ye not that ye are the

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE TRUE TEMPLE OF 
  GOD </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And the feast of the Passover 
    was at hand. And it came to pass that some of the disciples being masons, 
    were sent to repair the chambers of the Temple. Iesus (the Sun) passing by, 
    they said unto him, Master, see'st thou these great buildings and what manner 
    of stones are here, and how beautiful is the work of our ancestors? And Iesus 
    said, Yeah, IT IS BEAUTIFUL, and well wrought are the stones, but the time 
    cometh when one stone shall not be left upon another, for the enemy shall 
    overthrow both the City and the Temple.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And some of the scribes, hearing 
    him, sought to entangle him in his words and said, if thou wouldst put away 
    the sacrifices of sheep and oxen and birds, to what purpose was this temple 
    for God by Solomon, which has been now FORTY and SIX years in restoring? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Iesus answered and said, It 
    is written in the prophets, My House shall be called a House of Prayer for 
    All nations, for the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. But ye have made 
    it a house of slaughter and filled it with abomination.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the true temple is the Body 
    of Man in which God dwelleth by the Spirit, and when this temple is destroyed, 
    in Three days God raiseth up a more glorious temple which the eyes of natural 
    man perceiveth not.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, it is written, FROM THE 
    RISING OF THE SUN UNTO THE SETTING OF THE SAME my Name shall be great among 
    the Gentiles, and incense with a pure offering shall be offered unto me. But 
    ye have made it a desolation with your offerings of blood and used sweet incense 
    only to cover the ill savor thereof. I am not come to destroy the law but 
    to fulfill it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Know you not what is written? Obedience 
    is better than sacrifice, and to hearken better than the fat of rams. I the 
    Lord am weary of your burnt offerings </font>(the sacrificing of your sons 
    and daughters to the flames of war)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    and vain oblations. YOUR HANDS ARE FULL OF BLOOD.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And is it not written what is the 
    true sacrifice? Wash you and make you clean, and put away the evil from before 
    mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well. Do justice for the fatherless 
    and the widow and all that are oppressed. So doing ye fulfill the law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The day cometh when all that are 
    in the Outer court, which pertaineth to blood offerings, shall be taken away, 
    and pure worshippers shall worship the Eternal in purity and truth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they said, Who are thou that 
    seeketh to do away with the sacrifices, and despiseth the seed of Abraham? 
    From the Greeks and the Egyptians has thou learned this blasphemy?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Iesus said, Before Abraham 
    was, I Am. And they refused to listen and some said he is inspired by a demon, 
    and others said that he is mad; and went their way and told those things to 
    the priests and elders.&quot; </font>The Gospel of The Perfect Life, Lection

<p><font size="+1">Of course all of this leads to the Forty Sixth Psalm of the 
  King James Version of the Bible, and the realization that the name <i>Shakespear</i>

  It leads to the direct historical connection that exists between the Knights 
  Templars of the middle ages and the modern fraternity of Masonic lodges (the 
  York lodge in particular), the founding of the American nation, and the prophetic 
  implications of the Book of Ezekiel, chapter 28 (KJV). It leads to an understanding 
  of the development of the English language (the <i>unknown tongue </i>which 
  did not even exist when the Hebrew texts were being penned), and its absolute 
  importance to the interpretation of the mysteries of the Temple and the universal 
  dimensions of the Sacred Oracle--the Tree of Life. It leads us back to the Two 
  anointed ones whom God has placed again the garden of Eden:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a fascinating Midrash, Reish 
    Lakish says, &quot;Adam was the last work created on the last day of Creation, 
    and he (they) was also the earliest work created on the first day of Creation.&quot; 
    What does it mean? Reish Lakish explains, &quot;when the Torah tells us that 
    the Divine Presence hovered over the waters on the first day of Creation, 
    this actually refers to the soul of Moshiach. As it says, The spirit of Hashem 
    (The Name) will hover on him&quot; (Isaiah 11:2)...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This Midrash is baffling. If Moshiach 
    was created at the same time that the world was created, why has there been 
    such a long period of time between his creation and his revelation? Secondly, 
    what purpose was there in creating Moshiach if the world was not ready for 
    him?...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Gemara (Sanhedrin 98b) says 
    that the world was made for Moshiach. As we say every day in the <i>Aleinu</i> 
    prayer, &quot;Hashem will be king over the entire world--on that day hashem 
    will be One and his Name will be One&quot; We can understand that Hashem created 
    Moshiach at the beginning of the world's existence, before all the dark ages 
    (that Israel) had to traverse, to give us hope and courage to look toward 
    the future, when B'nai Israel will be completely redeemed...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The soul of Moshiach was created 
    at the very beginning of creation. This is because Moshiach would never give 
    the idea of any &quot;dual effort,&quot; but would rather bolster the idea 
    of Hashem's Oneness. Mashiach strengthens our understanding that the entire 
    world is conducted and led by Hashem, Who from the very first moment of time 
    determined our purpose and gave us our direction in life. Moshiach was here 
    first, and on the Great Day, Moshiach will be here last. </font>The Jewish
