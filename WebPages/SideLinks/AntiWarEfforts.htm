<p>Daphne Reed of Amherst, Mass., organized Mothers Against War. (Nathan Martin 
  For The Washington Post) </p>
<p>&#149; A comprehensive guide to The Debate About Iraq WITH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM 
  JIMMY CARTER, George Shultz, Sen. Zell Miller, Charles Krauthammer, Richard 
  Holbrooke, Michael Kelly, Gen. Wesley Clark and many others.</p>
<p>AMHERST, Mass. -- The idea was hatched on a bright day in August, when Daphne 
  Reed was celebrating her daughter's and granddaughter's birthdays, and the talk 
  around the living room sofa turned to war. Reed began worrying that her 25-year-old 
  grandson, who spent four years in the Coast Guard, might be called to serve 
  if the United States were to invade Iraq. Her family also wondered why the United 
  States was threatening to invade Iraq even before United Nations weapons inspections 
  began. And Reed fretted over the particular suffering that would befall Iraqi 
  women; their sons and husbands would be killed, she said, and the women would 
  be left in the rubble to fend off contaminated water and starvation.</p>
<p>&quot;I said that ALL MOTHERS SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE AGAINST WAR,&quot; Reed 
  said. &quot;It was against their nature to be violent instead of nurturing.&quot; 
  Maybe, she said, it was time to start a movement -- MOTHERS AGAINST WAR .</p>
<p>Reed's response is just a tiny part of a growing peace movement that has been 
  gaining momentum and raises the possibility that there could be much more dissent 
  if U.S. bombs begin falling on Baghdad. The retired Hampshire College drama 
  teacher e-mailed about 15 parents in her address book. Reed reached people such 
  as Elaine Kenseth, whose five children include a son she adopted from the killing 
  fields of Cambodia. Aileen O'Donnell, a veteran of the women's movement. Joanne 
  and Roger Lind, whose son was a Vietnam War conscientious objector. And Elizabeth 
  Verrill, who had never been involved in political causes. Before long, Mothers 
  Against War had 50 core members, and thousands of supporters around the country 
  and the world.</p>
<p>Most members of Mothers Against War are grandmothers in their seventies whose 
  lives are already full. Yet they spend hours a day on the Internet, reading 
  and spreading information on Iraq and the United States and planning for marches, 
  e-mail campaigns and teach-ins. Having lived through the Vietnam antiwar movement, 
  which took years to build, the Mothers Against War are buoyed to find themselves 
  part of a fast-growing movement of people from every walk of life, from every 
  political stripe.</p>
<p>The extraordinary array of groups questioning the Bush administration's rationale 
  for an invasion of Iraq includes longtime radical groups such as the Workers 
  World Party, but also groups not known for taking stands against the government. 
  There is a labor movement against war, led by organizers of the largest unions 
  in the country; a religious movement against the war, which includes leaders 
  of virtually every mainstream denomination; a veterans movement against the 
  war, led by those who fought Iraq in the Persian Gulf a decade ago; business 
  leaders against the war, led by corporate leaders; an antiwar movement led by 
  relatives of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks; and immigrant groups against 
  the war. There are also black and Latino organizations, hundreds of campus antiwar 
  groups and scores of groups of ordinary citizens meeting in community centers 
  and church basements from Baltimore to Seattle.</p>
<p>It has reached a point where United for Peace, a Web site started by the San 
  Francisco-based human rights organization Global Exchange for groups to list 
  events commemorating the Sept. 11 anniversary, has morphed into a national network 
  coordinating events for more than 70 peace groups nationwide. &quot;We're taking 
  the . . . Web site and rebuilding it as a one-stop shopping for the antiwar 
  movement,&quot; said Andrea Buffa, who co-chairs the new network. &quot;It's 
  a campaign of all different kinds of groups, from the National Council of Churches 
  to the International Socialists organization; I just got a call from the Raging 
  Grannies of Palo Alto, who want to join. We're bringing groups together to develop 
  a consensus statement and a calendar of coordinated antiwar events.&quot;</p>
<p>After large rallies in Washington and San Francisco on Oct. 26, the next big 
  day to test the antiwar movement's might is Dec. 10, International Human Rights 
  Day. Hundreds of groups plan events, rallies and civil disobedience to capture 
  the nation's attention, including demonstrations in Lafayette Park across from 
  the White House and at a military recruitment center in downtown Washington. 
  Otherwise, antiwar groups, which tend to rely on the Internet to receive and 
  spread information, operate largely without the attention of the media or Capitol 
  Hill. Yet many of those speaking out against an attack on Iraq represent large 
  numbers of Americans, including John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO (with 
  13 million members); the National Council of Churches (which represents 36 Protestant 
  and Orthodox denominations, with 50 million members); and the National Conference 
  of Catholic Bishops (the leadership arm of 65 million Roman Catholics).</p>
<p>Quietly Organizing </p>
<p>Among themselves, the groups are quietly organizing their ranks. A letter Sweeney 
  sent to Congress in early October expressing deep reservations about the justifications 
  for an invasion has begun to resonate among the rank and file, said Bob Muehlenkamp, 
  a labor consultant and former organizing director for the Teamsters union. Several 
  hundred thousand union members, he said, have signed up against the war, with 
  more joining every week. He expects the numbers to balloon when leaders hold 
  an organizational breakfast meeting for all unions in New York on Dec. 18. &quot;UNION 
  PEOPLE ARE THE MOST PATRIOTIC OF AMERICANS,&quot; Muehlenkamp said, &quot;yet 
  you can't find all-out aggressive support for a Bush war.&quot; Union members 
  have the same concerns as others opposed to the proposed war, including a belief 
  that the Bush administration has not weighed the economic consequences or made 
  the case for an unprecedented attack, he said. But they have their own concerns 
  as well. &quot;For unions,&quot; he said, &quot;IT'S THEIR KIDS THAT ARE GOING 
  TO BE DOING THE FIGHTING. IT'S OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHO COULD DIE.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Council of Churches, which includes Lutherans, Episcopalians and 
  President Bush's denomination, Methodists, is facilitating antiwar events for 
  traditionally liberal institutions and conservative churches, said the Rev. 
  Robert Edgar, its general secretary. &quot;Average, ordinary people,&quot; Edgar 
  said, &quot;who come from evangelical Christian conservative roots are organizing 
  against the war.&quot; Edgar, who served in Congress as a Democrat from suburban 
  Philadelphia from 1975 to 1987, recalled that he was a freshman Democrat during 
  the last days of the Vietnam War. Even then, he said, he and other lawmakers 
  had to fight to end U.S. involvement. He also remembered that it took the church 
  -- meaning most mainstream religious institutions -- 12 years to start opposing 
  that war. &quot;Whereas, the threat of war now has even middle churches, not 
  just liberal churches, involved in antiwar activities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>During its annual meeting last month, the National Council of Churches issued 
  a statement praising the National Conference of Catholic Bishops for reiterating 
  its position against a U.S. invasion. &quot;We thought it was important to acknowledge 
  their important work,&quot; Edgar said. Now, he said, the National Council of 
  Churches -- fresh from its &quot;What Would Jesus Drive?&quot; television ad 
  campaign to promote fuel efficiency -- is launching a &quot;SEASONS OF PEACEMAKING&quot; 
  campaign, &quot;moving beyond statements to actions. On December 8 through 15, 
  there will be a series of actions across the country. THE BIGGEST DAY, HE SAID, 
  IS DEC.10, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT, NOT ONLY BECAUSE ITS HUMAN RIGHTS DAY BUT ALSO 
  BECAUSE IT IS THE DAY THAT FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER IS TO RECEIVE HIS NOBEL 
  PEACE PRIZE. &quot;CARTER, AS AN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN, REPRESENTS A GREAT NUMBER 
  OF PEOPLE IN THE ANTIWAR EFFORT,&quot; EDGAR SAID.</p>
<p>Indeed, on that day, religious groups across the country plan to stage mass 
  acts of civil disobedience. Ben Cohen of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, founder 
  of Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, plans to join church groups in 
  New York and get arrested, he said, for the first time. &quot;I've never engaged 
  in civil disobedience before,&quot; he said. &quot;But if some country was going 
  to do this to us -- have a little preemptive war with the U.S., bomb our people, 
  kill or maim people because they thought that at some time we might bomb them, 
  we'd say that's a war crime. I feel that getting arrested is the biggest statement 
  that I could make to say that what the Bush administration is doing is wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>That day, as well as the weekend of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Jan. 
  18-19, is important for the smaller groups across the country as well. Damu 
  Smith, founder of the Washington-based Black Voices for Peace, said his group 
  plans to begin a poor people's peace movement similar to the one King was organizing 
  before his murder in 1968. Black Voices is planning its own rallies and forums 
  in Washington, as well as participating in planning national events as a member 
  of the steering committee for United for Peace, he said. &quot;Before Doctor 
  King died,&quot; Smith said, &quot;he was speaking out forcefully against the 
  United States involvement in Vietnam. He made the point that the money being 
  spent on bombs was money that could never be spent on addressing poverty. We 
  are taking up Doctor King's legacy.&quot;</p>
<p>While African Americans and other minorities have been underrepresented in 
  some national campaigns, such as the environmental movement, Smith, executive 
  director of the National Black Environmental Justice Network, said that he has 
  had no trouble recruiting against the proposed war. The group, which he began 
  a few weeks after Sept. 11, 2001, in response to a lack of African American 
  voices in the policy debates and newscasts surrounding the attacks, has more 
  than 3,000 members, he said. Not all are African American. &quot;We get calls 
  from people who say, 'I'm white, but I want to join your group,' just as in 
  the civil rights movement. It's such a shame that the media has not focused 
  on what is happening because there are so many voices working together.&quot;</p>
<p>Remembering Another War </p>
<p>Those who still remember the horrors of the Vietnam War, like the members of 
  Mothers Against War, find themselves connected to this new antiwar movement 
  on a personal as well as ideological level. The other day, as half a dozen core 
  members sat in Daphne Reed's living room, they remembered friends who had fled 
  to Canada to shield their sons from the military draft, friends who died in 
  the war, and lives forever changed by the war. Joanne and Roger Lind, 77 and 
  78, respectively, are retired professors of sociology and social work, whose 
  son received his draft card as soon as he turned 18 in 1965. As Quakers, the 
  Linds were actively working toward peaceful solutions to the crisis, including 
  organizing teach-ins. Their son became a conscientious objector, and did community 
  work, known then as alternative service. &quot;But sons of our friends were 
  not so lucky,&quot; Joanne Lind said. &quot;THEY SERVED TWO YEARS IN PRISON.&quot;</p>
<p>Elaine Kenseth, at 59 the youngest of the group, remembered that her friends 
  started getting married in 1964 before finishing school so that their men could 
  be exempt from the draft. &quot;Others left for Canada. THEY LIVED THERE UNTIL 
  PRESIDENT CARTER CREATED AMNESTY FOR THEM.&quot;</p>
<p>She became active in helping refugees of the war resettle in Western Massachusetts, 
  and adopted her Cambodian son, when he was 16. &quot;When we say we're mothers 
  against war,&quot; she said, &quot;we're also saying we're mothers seeking peace. 
  WE ARE ACTIVELY SPREADING PEACE IN THE WORLD.&quot;</p>
<p>Reed, recalling the four wars she has seen this country involved in during 
  her lifetime, said she is often motivated by a single memory decades old. She 
  was visiting the nation's capital, she said, when she saw a man without a face. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;without a face. He had nothing but a plastic 
  mask with two holes for eyes and one for mouth. It still swims before my inner 
  vision, provoking an agony of grief that no one had been able to stop the war 
  that took away that man's face.&quot;</p>

  <p>I am writing this letter, trying to appeal to all mothers. I too am a mother. 
    If you place a rattle in an infants hand eventually he will learn to shake 
    it. Then also if a little boy, mine or yours, has a gun in his hand he will 
    learn to shoot it. Look, it's all right if you want your child to fight a 
    war, if you don't mind going through nine months of life just to lose them. 
    But my nine months were not easy. If you feel his life is all his own and 
    his mistakes are his own...but I feel differently. I have (no extra sons to

  <p>For generations guns and rifles, cowboys and Indians, pre-planned wars and

    to you to help try a new way. Let's have a generation of no war toys. Perhaps 
    then there will come of it a generation who has to go to their dictionary...to 
    hunt up what the word war means. Maybe I'm wrong, Maybe &quot;Johnny&quot; 
    will still have an instinct for war. But maybe I'm right, and maybe neither 
    of us have to lose a child or husband. And then nine months won't seem so 
    terribly long...to me a mother.</p>

<p align="center">A Post-Mortem on the Peace Movement?</p>
<p align="center">By Cynthia Peters </p>
<p>December 26, 2001__Today a Village Voice reporter called to interview me for 
  a story he is writing. His assignment? To do a post-mortem on the peace movement. 
  &quot;But wait,&quot; I say. &quot;A post-mortem is what you do when something's 
  dead.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; he agrees. &quot;Who says the peace movement is dead?&quot; 
  I ask, trying to suppress a rising anxiety. Had it somehow been killed off in 
  the last couple of hours when I had my attention elsewhere? After all, just 
  this morning someone from the nearby town of Natick had called me. She's trying 
  to get a local peace and justice group off the ground, and wanted advice. A 
  couple of weeks ago, I was out in Newton meeting with a group that is launching 
  its own local effort. </p>
<p>All over the city, in neighborhoods like Dorchester, Revere, East Boston, Allston-Brighton, 
  Roslindale -- grassroots groups are mobilizing. The same is true in the outlying 
  towns of Somerville, Malden, Taunton, Waltham, Belmont, Cambridge, Lexington, 
  and others. Only yesterday, there was a meeting of the United for Justice with 
  Peace (UJP) community outreach subcommittee -- a group that is helping to coordinate 
  all these grassroots efforts, provide mailing lists, send speakers, develop 
  strategy, and generally lend support. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the pre-9/11 peace and justice groups and community-based groups 
  have added a new dimension to their work. Now, along with whatever they were 
  doing before (tenant organizing, immigrant rights, etc.), they have integrated 
  into that agenda the work of contesting the new domestic repression and international 
  aggression. And students all over the country are mobilizing on campuses. The 
  students, faculty and staff of Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, 
  voted overwhelmingly recently to condemn the &quot;war on terrorism.&quot; Their 
  resounding rejection of the U.S. war abroad, and its attendant domestic repression 
  ends with a promise to &quot;commit the full resources and energies of our community&quot; 
  to ending hunger, war and economic injustice. </p>
<p>Turns out, this reporter read about the death of the peace movement in the 
  mainstream press, not a medium which is exactly known for its in-depth reporting 
  on social change struggles. He also went to a peace rally at Rockefeller Center 
  in New York, attended by only about 250 people. I can't speak for New York, 
  but I know what's happening around Boston. We would probably have a similar 
  outcome if we held a city-wide demonstration at this particular time. But that 
  doesn't mean there is no movement. If large demonstrations have faded, and people 
  have focused their attention on their communities, that is entirely proper. 
</p>
<p>The New York Times won't cover it, but going to our neighbors, to our co-workers, 
  and to our communities, is the only way to build something that might cause 
  the New York Times -- and more importantly our government -- to actually sit 
  up and take notice. And it's the only way to create a political home for -- 
  to channel the energy of -- those newly aroused to social change work by Bush's 
  war. And there are currently many of those. I hear from them by email every 
  day, and I talk to them out in my own neighborhood. </p>
<p>&quot;Please help me.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I need direction.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I feel so hopeless.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;This war is making me sick to my stomach.&quot; </p>
<p>These are some of the most common refrains. Many came in by email recently 
  in response to my ZNET commentary &quot;A Veil on the Truth,&quot; which detailed 
  the U.S.'s blocking of peacekeepers being sent to Afghanistan, where they are 
  desperately needed to secure the aid routes in a country full of starving people. 
  No matter how you feel about the U.S. &quot;war on terrorism&quot; or about 
  the need for a military strike against al Qaeda, there is no justification for 
  the crime against humanity currently unfolding in Afghanistan, for which the 
  United States, and by extension, U.S. citizens, can be held directly responsible. 
</p>
<p>This is not a difficult moral judgement to make. Yet if you make it -- if you 
  choose to absorb this awareness -- then you have to live with that sick feeling 
  in your stomach. Not only that. You have to take responsibility for it. Neither 
  choosing to understand nor taking responsibility are easy, but they are not 
  the hardest thing you have to do once you head down this path. The hardest thing 
  is holding the following two seemingly completely divergent facts in your mind: 
  1) The situation is desperately urgent; and 2) The only possible response is 
  the painstaking work of educating people, changing people's minds, and creating 
  channels for social change. </p>
<p>In my local peace and justice group, we have been organizing since the beginning 
  of October. We are out tabling twice a week; we have persuaded cafes, beauty 
  salons, and CD shops to display our &quot;alternative information binders&quot;; 
  we hosted a teach-in, which hundreds attended; we are building local/global 
  bridges by connecting with other neighborhood organizations; we are rallying 
  neighbors to do congressional visits. We are a steady, dedicated, and growing 
  group. </p>
<p>Yet &quot;steady,&quot; &quot;dedicated,&quot; and &quot;growing,&quot; has 
  a way of seeming screamingly insufficient next to the untold human loss caused 
  by the U.S. war. Organizing for social change means walking the fault line of 
  extant human rights catastrophes on one side and tedious efforts leading to 
  incremental -- often defensive -- change on the other. At one of our meetings, 
  someone reminds us of the terrible toll starvation will take on the Afghan people. 
  &quot;We have to do something,&quot; she says. &quot;This is what we're doing,&quot; 
  somebody replies, indicating the work of our small group. Indeed. Urgency is 
  correct, as well as the desire to do something, but we have to give expression 
  to those feelings in the day-to-day work of movement building -- much of it 
  tedious and seemingly no match for the emergency at hand. Yet movement building 
  is the only match for the emergency at hand. </p>
<p>It's here, in this disconnect between horrific conditions all around us, and 
  the slow plodding work of changing those conditions, that we lose so many potential 
  activists. The hardest conversations I have with people when I'm tabling don't 
  have to do with whether the war is just or not, but whether there's any point 
  in doing anything about it. As activists, we must not just berate people with 
  all that's wrong, all that hurts, but offer viable strategies for taking a stand 
  against the pain, and a vision of what could lay on the other side. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we must nurture connections between local and global struggles 
  -- giving peace and justice activists who came together around this new war 
  in Afghanistan a chance to hear directly from peace and justice activists who 
  have been fighting battles on the local scene for decades. Tenant organizers, 
  anti-death penalty activists, and welfare rights groups bring a wealth of experience 
  and fortitude to their political work. They know how long change takes. They 
  have created political &quot;homes&quot; for people that make it possible for 
  them to stay engaged for the long-term. The events of September 11 and Bush's 
  &quot;war on terrorism,&quot; have aroused questioning minds and potential activism. 
  For many, it is not too much of a leap to understand and oppose the inhumane 
  consequences of U.S. foreign policy. </p>
<p>What is harder is the subsequent challenge of straddling the gap between the 
  urgency of those consequences and the slow, careful work of organizing. We don't 
  get much help for this difficult work. The mainstream media plies us with the 
  Pentagon's spin on the war, all the while treating us as agents only insofar 
  as we consume their advertising. We hear over and over again about the intricacies 
  of shopping online; NBA trades, game strategies, and team trivia; the minutia 
  of market fluctuations; as well as detailed accounts of the interior decorating 
  decisions of the rich and famous. But there are no articles about citizenship, 
  democratic participation, and the processes by which we might make our voices 
  heard. At a time of acknowledged national and international crisis, the media 
  would have us think there is no role for public citizens other than waving the 
  flag and buying red, white and blue Christmas sweaters. </p>
<p>So it's not surprising we feel helpless, hopeless and sick to the stomach. 
  We understand what's wrong; we understand we must take responsibility; but no 
  action on our part seems adequate. When we forge ahead anyway, merging our individual 
  effort with the efforts of others to educate, agitate, and make our dissent 
  known -- even when we are doing it energetically with a great deal of forward 
  momentum -- we discover the Village Voice has sent a reporter to cover our demise. 
</p>
<p>I did my best to convince the reporter that his post-mortem was premature. 
  But in the end, he's not really the one I need to be talking to. I'd rather 
  spend my time responding to the ones who feel lost right now -- the ones who 
  understand the criminality of the U.S. war and who see to whom the benefits 
  of domestic repression accrue, but who don't know what to do about it. To them, 
  I say: Start an organization in your town; link it to organizations in other 
  towns; create forums for people to learn from each other and relate; help shape 
  the agendas of already existing organizations to respond effectively to changing 
  circumstances; build bridges between local and global efforts; lobby congress; 
  write letters to the media; stand out on the street corner with alternative 
  information; collect contact information for those who want to get involved; 
  share articles by email; reach out to like-minded souls; build a supportive 
  community around you that will help you do the work for the long-term. And, 
  most importantly, don't give up. The war-makers and the corporate suits don't 
  give up. They devote all their resoures to advancing their agenda. And they're 
  so worried about people like us devoting our resources to an alternative that 
  they try to kill us off in our infancy. </p>

  <b>IRAQ ACTIVIST KATHY KELLY SENTENCED TO FEDERAL PRISON</b></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  January 28, 2004...Yesterday in Columbus, Georgia, Kathy Kelly, co-founder of 
  Voices in the Wilderness and three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee, was sentenced 
  to three months in federal prison for enacting her habit of bearing witness 
  against US military violence, this time by crossing onto the property of Ft. 
  Benning military base in November of 2003, as a form of protest against the 
  School of the Americas/Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation 
  (SOA/WHISC). You can read &quot;Hogtied and Abused at Fort Benning,&quot; her 
  account of the inhumane treatment that she received by her arresting officers.</p>
<p>By visiting the SOA Watch website, you can find more information about the 
  SOA/WHISC, which has trained many of the military dictators and soldiers who 
  have massacred hundreds of thousands of people of Central and South America, 
  especially indigenous people. You can also learn about other ways to support 
  the project of closing the SOA/WHISC. Just as the US occupation in Iraq fails 
  to provide for the security of ordinary Iraqis, the SOA/WHISC has, at the very 
  least, failed in its stated task of 'security' for Latin America and, in actuality, 
  created more insecurity and fear for millions of people in the Global South. 
  Kathy's act of crossing the line with 27 other witnesses for peace, including 
  VitW friend Rev. Jerry Zawada, O.F.M., is a sign of the commitment to nonviolent 
  direct action which Voices in the Wilderness clings to as a hopeful road to 
  peace and social justice in our world.</p>
<p>Alongside Kathy, Fr. Jerry Zawada, an Iraq Peace Team member and recent VitW 
  delegate to Iraq, was sentenced to six months in federal prison (he was convicted 
  of trespassing at the SOA/WHISC last year as well), Faith Fippinger, a former 
  Human Shield in Iraq, was sentenced to three months in prison, and Scott Diehl, 
  a CPT member who was in Iraq during the 2003 invasion, was also sentenced to 
  three months in prison. May we all begin to draw the connections between the 
  destruction caused by surging US militarism in Iraq and its effects elsewhere, 
  wherever that may be. Here in the United States, military recruiters continue 
  to steal the lives of students in our poorest schools and US police officers 
  (such as those in Miami during the recent FTAA protests) are being ordered to 
  beat down and trample their fellow US citizens who nonviolently protest the 
  architects of social injustice.</p>

  <b>Statement before Judge G. Mallon Faircloth, who sentenced me to 3 months 
  in federal prison after I pled not guilty but stipulated to the facts of a charge 
  for a November 22, 2003 entry onto Fort Benning, an open US military base in 
  Columbus, GA.</b></p>
<p><b>by Kathy Kelly Columbus, GA January 26, 2004</b></p>
<p>I'm fortunate to have been influenced by the life and witness of some extraordinary 
  individuals, many of whom have appeared before you in court, several of whom 
  are now co-defendants. Their witness in this court has been valuable, constituting 
  a rich and sad drama.</p>
<p>It's important to continue bringing before this court testimony from or about 
  those who can't appear, people whom we've met when visiting places directly 
  affected by US expenditures on military training and military solutions. Quite 
  often these solutions are based on threat and force, rather than considerations 
  of mercy and compassion.</p>
<p>A report in the London Observer yesterday quotes US Armed forces medical personnel 
  warning that 20 percent of the veterans returning from Iraq will suffer post 
  traumatic stress disorders -already 22 soldiers have committed suicide.</p>
<p>Families of these soldiers, whose arms will ache emptily for loved ones that 
  will never return, can, I believe, find understanding in the families of others 
  far away from the US who similarly feel bereaved.</p>
<p>In 1985, very aware of Joe Mulligan's and Bernie Survil's work, I traveled 
  to San Juan de Limay, in the north of Nicaragua. Children there were radiant 
  and friendly, many of them too young to understand that during the previous 
  week US funded contras had kidnapped and murdered 25 people in their village. 
  Later that summer, I fasted with Nicaraguan's Foreign Minister, himself a Maryknoll 
  priest, and listened to stories pour forth as many hundreds of Nicaraguan peasant 
  pilgrims vigiled and fasted in the Mon senor Lezcano church to show solidarity 
  with the priest-minister's desire to nonviolently resist contra terrorism. Rev. 
  Miguel D'Escoto urged us to find nonviolent actions commensurate to the crimes 
  being committed. This experience gave me reason to believe that the US could 
  have used negotiation and diplomacy to resolve disputes with Nicaragua.</p>
<p>The Christian Peacemaker Teams maintained a steady presence in Jeremie, in 
  the southern finger of Haiti, throughout the time when the US had determined 
  it was too dangerous for US soldiers to be there. In 1995, I was there for the 
  three months just before the US troops returned. Throughout this stretch of 
  history, the US spent more money on troop movements, equipping troops, training 
  troops, &#150; than it spent on meeting human needs. The Commandant of the region, 
  Colonel Rigobert Jean, commented publicly that he was &quot;ashamed and embarrassed 
  that it was left to the 'blans' (Creole for foreigners) on the hill to preserve 
  peace and security in the region.&quot; He was referring to our five person 
  team. Again, I had reason to believe that unarmed peacemakers could be relied 
  on to create greater security in areas of conflict.</p>
<p>Indelibly marked in my memory from that summer are the Creole words that children 
  could no longer suppress as evenings drew to a close and they longed for adequate 
  meals. &quot;M'gen grangou,&quot; I'm hungry.</p>
<p>More recently, in Iraq, during the US bombing in March and April of 2003, I 
  saw how children suffer when nations decide to put their resources into weapons 
  and warfare rather than meeting human needs. All of us learned to adopt a poker 
  face, hoping not to frighten the children, whenever there were ear-splitting 
  blasts and gut wrenching thuds. During every day and night of the bombing, I 
  would hold little Miladhah and Zainab in my arms. That's how I learned of their 
  fear: they were grinding their teeth, morning, noon and night. But they were 
  far more fortunate than the children who were survivors of direct hits, children 
  whose brothers and sisters and parents were maimed and killed.</p>
<p>Judge Faircloth, we have experienced and seen the deadly effect of US military 
  policy on mothers and children, on families. We have held the children and tried 
  to comfort them under bombs.</p>
<p>It is because of these experiences that we feel so strongly. And this is why 
  I'm willing to go into the US prison system and experience again, as we have 
  before, the suffering of all of these women who are being separated from their 
  families in the American prisons. It's important to hear the voices of women 
  trying to comfort their own children over the telephone, children they won't 
  see be able to hug and cuddle, &#150; I remember my friend Gloria, in the prison 
  telephone room: &quot;Momma's gonna tickle your feets, oh baby, momma's gonna 
  tickle your feet, you momma's baby.&quot; Gloria and many thousands of other 
  mothers locked up in a world of imprisoned beauty would never tickle their baby's 
  feet, because they'd been sentenced to mandatory five year minimums.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think we face a wilderness of compassion in this country. But when 
  I think of the many voices that have tried, in this court, to clamor for the 
  works of mercy rather than the works of war, I feel at home, I feel grateful, 
  and I feel a deep urge to be silent and listen to the cries of those most afflicted, 
  &#150; their cries are often hard to hear &#150; but when we hear them, we're 
  called, all of us, to be like voices in the wilderness, raising their laments 
  and finding ourselves motivated to build a better world.</p>

  week, to support the organizing work for March 20, the global day of action 
  on the one-year anniversary of the Iraq War. We have nearly reached our early 
  February goal of $20,000. We're still a few thousand short, so if you haven't 
  made your contribution yet, please donate today by visiting http://www.unitedforpeace.org</p>
<p>IN THIS UPDATE:<br>
  1. Dozens of March 20 events now planned around U.S.<br>
  2. Military families and veterans to rally at Ft. Bragg<br>
  3. NYC: Joint march and rally planned</p>
<p>MARCH 20 AROUND THE UNITED STATES<br>
  Crawford, Texas; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Long Beach, California; Tallahassee, 
  Florida: These are just a few of the dozens of communities large and small around 
  the United States where March 20 events are already planned.</p>
<p>Now is the time to plan your community's involvement in this global day of 
  action. We in the United States have a special responsibility to take to the 
  streets on the one-year anniversary of the Iraq War to show the depth of U.S. 
  opposition to the Bush Administration's policies of war and occupation.</p>

<p>MILITARY FAMILIES AND VETERANS TO RALLY AT FT. BRAGG<br>
  On March 20th, as the world once again says NO! to war, military families and 
  veterans of the military will take center stage in Fayetteville, North Carolina 
  - the home of Fort Bragg -- as the North Carolina Coalition for Peace and Justice 
  demands that the United States government provide REAL support for G.I.'s and 
  other military personnel by bringing them home now.</p>
<p>This rally will draw attention to the stop-loss policy that keeps personnel 
  in the service beyond the time that they originally committed to, inadequate 
  psychological and emotional services for military personnel and their families, 
  and other key issues of interest to military families and veterans. It will 
  also demand that the government commit billions to education and the creation 
  of jobs, not war and occupations.</p>

<p>NEW YORK CITY: JOINT MARCH &amp; RALLY PLANNED<br>
  Plans are moving ahead for a major East Coast regional mobilization in New York 
  City for March 20. An agreement has recently been reached between two coalitions 
  for a joint march and rally in New York City. United for Peace and Justice makes 
  this announcement on behalf of the March 20th Mobilizing Committee, the coalition 
  of national anti-war coalitions we pulled together. Below you will find the 
  joint statement issued by the two coalitions.</p>
<p>The New York City March 20 event will begin at noon in Midtown Manhattan; details 
  about location are still being negotiated with the police and parks department. 
  Check our website at http://www.unitedforpeace.org/nyc for updates, and if you're 
  not already receiving our separate New York City action alerts, sign up at http://www.unitedforpeace.org/email</p>
<p>Visit our website at http://www.unitedforpeace.org/nyc for downloadable NYC 
  March 20 leaflets, plus a ride and housing board. You can also pick up leaflets 
  and stickers at our New York City office during normal business hours: 351 W. 
  41st Street, 5th floor (between 8th &amp; 9th Avenues); 212-868-5545.</p>
<p>The next general mobilizing meeting for March 20 in New York City will take 
  place on Tuesday, February 17 at 6:30PM, at 235 W. 23rd Street (between 7th 
  &amp; 8th Avenues). All are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Member groups of the March 20th Mobilizing Committee include:<br>
  - United for Peace and Justice<br>
  - National Youth and Student Peace Coalition<br>
  - US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation<br>
  - Not in Our Name<br>
  - Campus Anti-War Network<br>
  - And others</p>
<p>The U.S. occupation of Iraq has spiraled into a living nightmare without end 
  as the death toll mounts daily. Here at home, new questions are asked about 
  why this war ever happened, but the Bush Administration continues to lie and 
  evade the truth, hoping people will forget by Election Day.</p>
<p>Now is the time for the voices of peace and justice to speak out. On March 
  20th a clear, strong message must be sent to the Bush Administration: &quot;End 
  the Occupation of Iraq! Bring the Troops Home! Now!&quot;</p>
<p>The war against Iraq and the military and corporate occupation of that country 
  are tied to other critically important issues. As we build the March 20th demonstrations 
  around the country, we will help draw out the connections that must be made. 
  Precisely because it is an election year, now is the time to put the largest 
  possible number of people in the streets.</p>
<p>JOINT STATEMENT BETWEEN MARCH 20th MOBILIZING COMMITTEE AND MARCH 20th NATIONAL 
  COALITION CONCERNING NEW YORK CITY MARCH AND RALLY</p>
<p>On March 20th, the one year anniversary of the U.S. war against Iraq, a Global 
  Day of Action will bring hundreds of thousands of people into the streets in 
  cities around the world. In New York City the March 20th Mobilizing Committee 
  and the March 20th National Coalition are organizing a unified demonstration 
  opposing the criminal and empire-building policies of the Bush administration 
  and their impact abroad and at home. We will march for an end to the U.S. occupation 
  and corporate control of Iraq and to bring the troops home now. We will march 
  for an end to the occupation of Palestine. We will march to fund human needs, 
  restore cuts in social programs and against the ever-expanding attacks on all 
  immigrants, labor rights and everyone's civil liberties - and we will stand 
  united against racism here and abroad. We represent diverse communities and 
  organizations opposed to the Bush Administration policies for many reasons, 
  but on March 20th we will march together. By working!<br>
  together our two coalitions are confident we will mobilize a massive turnout 
  on March 20th and send a strong, clear message.</p>

<p>BOSTON GLOBE EDITORIAL</p>
<p>Room for disagreement<br>
  July 21, 2004</p>
<p>PROTESTERS WANT to march down Causeway Street in front of the FleetCenter on 
  Sunday, the day before the Democratic National Convention opens. Causeway Street 
  will not be a public way that day, so the city refuses to give marchers a permit. 
  This is an example of security run amok. A federal judge ought to force the 
  city to keep the street open for the march.</p>
<p>The city is building a fence blocking public access to Causeway Street, leaving 
  only an expanded sidewalk for pedestrians on the side away from the FleetCenter. 
  This closure will create a &quot;hard zone&quot; for maximum security precautions 
  during convention week.</p>
<p>In the post-9/11 era, it makes sense to reserve Causeway Street for emergency 
  vehicles and for people with security clearance on days when the convention 
  is in session. Before that, however, the rights of other citizens should not 
  be abridged.</p>
<p>Organizers of the protest expect 2,000 people to march from Boston Common on 
  Sunday. The police want to channel them away from Causeway onto neighboring 
  streets and have them end up at the designated protest area on Canal Street. 
  &quot;This is a march against the Democratic National Convention. The symbol 
  of marching to the convention site is the essence of the protest,&quot; said 
  Dustin Langley, media coordinator for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, in 
  a telephone interview. &quot;We have a right to march because John Kerry and 
  the Democratic Party are complicit in the war in Iraq and complicit in the war 
  against working people.&quot; Whatever the merits of Langley's remarks, the 
  strength of a democracy is shown by its willingness to give ample expression 
  to minority views.</p>
<p>Mary Jo Harris, who is handling legal issues for the Boston Police Department, 
  said yesterday that security officials have no objection to small groups of 
  protesters handing out leaflets on the Causeway Street sidewalk on Sunday. The 
  rights of all the protesters ought to be protected, not just a few.</p>
<p>A march in front of the FleetCenter would force the police to deploy more officers 
  than they would if the protest were diverted to side streets. That would put 
  extra pressure on already hard pressed security forces. It made sense for the 
  city to refuse Senator John Kerry's request for a concert on the Esplanade in 
  the middle of convention week because it would have added to the burden on the 
  police.</p>
<p>A protest, unlike a concert, is an essential act of democracy and need not 
  be snuffed out by security concerns. Federal Judge Douglas P. Woodlock should 
  side with free expression on Sunday. A protest, unlike a concert, is an essential 
  act of democracy and need not be snuffed out by security concerns. Federal Judge

  Location Set for August 29 Protest<br>
  MARCH PAST MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,<br>
  RALLY ON MANHATTAN'S WEST SIDE </p>
<p><br>
  United for Peace and Justice has set the location for our much-anticipated August 
  29 &quot;World Says No to the Bush Agenda&quot; march and rally on the eve of 
  the Republican Convention. </p>
<p>In a major victory for UFPJ, the march will go directly past Madison Square 
  Garden, site of the Republican National Convention (RNC). We will step off from 
  23rd Street, march north on 7th Avenue, then head west on 34th Street and south 
  on the West Side Highway for our rally, with the stage at Chambers Street. </p>
<p>The decision comes after months of high-profile and testy negotiations over 
  the rally site, in which UFPJ put forth five proposals, including Central Park 
  and Times Square, only to be met by an ultimatum from the administration of 
  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to take the West Side Highway site. </p>
<p>&quot;Rather than prolong the fight over the rally site, we and organizers 
  around the country can now focus on building the largest possible demonstration 
  against the Bush administration's policies,&quot; said Leslie Cagan, UFPJ's 
  national coordinator. &quot;We're appalled by the bullying tactics of Republican 
  Mayor Bloomberg, who tried to stop our February 15, 2003 protest and once again 
  is undermining fundamental constitutional rights. Take action, join us in the 
  streets!&quot; </p>

<p> August 29, New York City<br>
  The World Says No to the Bush Agenda!<br>
  On Sunday, August 29, one of the biggest and most important protests in a generation 
  will take place in New York City: a massive march and rally on the eve of the 
  Republican National Convention, organized by United for Peace and Justice. If 
  you're alarmed by the direction that the Bush Administration has taken this 
  country, you will want to make your voice heard at this historic gathering, 
  where we will march against war, greed, hate and lies. Already, many thousands 
  of individuals and hundreds of groups - anti-war, civil rights, immigrant, religious, 
  labor, feminist, environmental, and many more - are planning to participate 
  in this demonstration. The Republican National Convention - and the protests 
  - will be covered by media outlets around the world. It is vital that we bring 
  the largest possible number of people to New York City on Sunday, August 29 
  to speak out against the actions and plans of the Bush Administration.<br>
