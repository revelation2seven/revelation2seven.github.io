<p align="center">UN WARNS LAND QUICKLY BECOMING DESERT<br>
  Wednesday, June 16, 2004</p>

<p>UNITED NATIONS - The world is turning to dust, with lands the size of Rhode 
  Island becoming desert wasteland every year and the problem threatening to send 
  millions of people fleeing to greener countries, the United Nations says.</p>
<p>One-third of the Earth's surface is at risk, driving people into cities and 
  destroying agriculture in vast swaths of Africa. Thirty-one percent of Spain 
  is threatened, while China has lost 36,000 square miles to desert - an area 
  the size of Indiana - since the 1950s.</p>
<p>This week the United Nations marks the 10th anniversary of the Convention to 
  Combat Desertification, a plan aimed at stopping the phenomenon. Despite the 
  efforts, the trend seems to be picking up speed - doubling its pace since the 
  1970s.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a creeping catastrophe,&quot; said Michel Smitall, a spokesman for 
  the U.N. secretariat that oversees the 1994 accord. &quot;Entire parts of the 
  world might become uninhabitable.&quot;</p>
<p>Slash-and-burn agriculture, sloppy conservation, overtaxed water supplies and 
  soaring populations are mostly to blame. But global warming is taking its toll, 
  too.</p>
<p>The United Nations is holding a ceremony tomorrow in Bonn, Germany, to mark 
  the World Day to Combat Desertification, and will hold a meeting in Brazil this 
  month to take stock of the problem.</p>
<p>The warning comes as rivers and lakes dry up in the western part of the United 
  States, giving Americans a taste of what's to come elsewhere. </p>
<p>The United Nations says: From the mid-1990s to 2000, 1,374 square miles have 
  turned into deserts each year - an area about the size of Rhode Island. That's 
  up from 840 square miles in the 1980s, and 624 square miles during the 1970s. 
  By 2025, two-thirds of arable land in Africa will disappear, along with one-third 
  of Asia's and one-fifth of South America's. About 135 million people - equivalent 
  to the populations of France and Germany combined - are at risk of being displaced. 
  Most at risk are dry regions on the edges of deserts - places like sub-Saharan 
  Africa or the Gobi Desert in China, where people already are struggling to eke 
  out a living from the land.</p>
<p>As populations expand, those regions have become more stressed. Trees are cut 
  for firewood, grasslands are overgrazed, fields are over-farmed and lose their 
  nutrients, water becomes scarcer and dirtier.</p>
<p>Technology can make the problem worse. In parts of Australia, irrigation systems 
  are pumping up salty water and slowly poisoning farms. In Saudi Arabia, herdsmen 
  can use water trucks instead of taking their animals from oasis to oasis - but 
  by staying in one place, the herds are getting bigger and eating all the grass.</p>
<p>In Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece, coastal resorts are swallowing up water 
  that once moistened the wilderness. Many farmers in those countries still flood 
  their fields instead of using more miserly &quot;drip irrigation,&quot; and 
  the resulting shortages are slowly bakin the life out of the land.</p>
<p>The result is a patchy &quot;rash&quot; of dead areas, rather than an easy-to-see 
  expansion of existing deserts, scientists say. These areas have their good times 
  and bad times as the weather changes. But in general, they are getting bigger 
  and worse-off.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not as dramatic as a flood or a big disaster like an earthquake,&quot; 
  said Richard Thomas of the International Center for Agricultural Research in 
  the Dry Areas in Aleppo, Syria. &quot;There are some bright spots and hot spots. 
  But overall, there is a trend toward increasing degradation.&quot; </p>
<p>The trend is speeding up, but it has been going on for centuries, scientists 
  say. Fossilized pollen and seeds, along with ancient tools like grinding stones, 
  show that much of the Middle East, the Mediterranean and North Africa were once 
  green. The Sahara itself was a savanna, and rock paintings show giraffes, elephants 
  and cows once lived there.</p>
<p>Global warming contributes to the problem, making many dry areas drier, scientists 
  say. In the past century, average temperatures have risen more than 1 degree 
  Fahrenheit worldwide, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.</p>
<p>It is too early to tell whether the six-year drought in the southwestern part 
  of the United States could turn to something more permanent. But scientists 
  note that reservoir levels are dropping as cities such as Phoenix and Las Vegas 
  expand.</p>
<p>The Global Change Research Program says global warming eventually could make 
  the Southwest wetter - but it also would cause more extreme weather, meaning 
  harsher droughts that could kill vegetation. Now, the drought has become so 
  severe that even the sagebrush is dying. &quot;The lack of water and the overuse 
  of water, that is going to be a threat to the United States,&quot; Thomas said.</p>
