    stopped work and took to the streets as an eerie twilight followed by darkness 
    covered their capitals during midday.</font></p>

    the English translation of the title of the remarkable German romance, or 
    novel, or fantasy, published at Starsburg in 1616. It is the third item in 
    the series which launched the Rosicrusion furore. The series came out annually 
    for three years, the </font><i><font size="+1">Fama</font></i><font size="+1">

    </i>in 1616, each adding to the mounting excitement about the Rosicrucian 
    mystery. And the historical clue which we have found to the </font><i><font size="+1">Fama</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    and the </font><i><font size="+1">Confessio</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    can also help us in the unravelling of the </font><i><font size="+1">Wedding</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    which is a romance about a husband and wife who dwell in a wondrous castle 
    full of marvels...but is at the same time an allegory of alchemical processes 
    interpreted symbolically as an experience of the mystical marriage of the 
    soul--an experience which is undergone by Christian Rosencreutz through the 
    visions conveyed to him in the castle, through theatrical performances, through 
    ceremonies of initiation into orders of chivalry, through the society of the 
    court in the castle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE NARRATIVE IS DIVIDED INTO SEVEN 
    DAYS, like the Book of Genesis. The First Day opens with the author preparing 
    himself on Easter Eve for his Easter Communion. Sitting at a table, he conversed 
    with his Creator in humble prayer and considered many great mysteries &quot;whereof 
    the Father of Lights had shown me not a few...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE SECOND DAY SEES THE HERO JOURNEYING 
    TOWARD THE WEDDING, AMID THE REJOICING OF NATURE. Arrived at a royal portal 
    on a hill, the porter demands his Letter of Invitation which, fortunately, 
    he had not forgotten to bring with him, and asked who he was. He replied that 
    he was a brother of the Red Rosey Cross. At the next gate, a roaring Lion 
    was chained, but the porter drove him back and the hero passed in. Bells began 
    to ring in the castle; the porter urged him to hurry or he would be too late. 
    Anxiously he hurried,FOLLOWING A LAMP-LIGHTING VIRGIN, and only got inside 
    the gate before it clapped shut...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ON THE THIRD DAY THE SUN DAWNED 
    BRIGHT AND GLORIOUS, trumpets sounded for the assembling of the guests, and 
    again the Virgin appeared. Scales were brought in and everyone was weighed, 
    including several Emperors who were present. Some people came off very badly 
    in this weighing. But when Christian Rosencreutz was weighed, who held himself 
    very humbly and seemed less important than the others, one of the pages cried 
    &quot;That is he!&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the Fourth Day, Rosencreutz 
    went out early to refresh himself at the Fountain in the Garden, where he 
    found that the Lion, instead of his sword, had a tablet beside him with an 
    inscription beginning HERMES PRINCIPS. The main event of this day was a theatrical 
    performance, given before the King and Queen and attended by all the guests 
    and household...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the Fifth Day the narrator was 
    exploring the underground parts of the castle, when he came to a Door on which 
    was a mysterious inscription. When it opened, a vault was disclosed, into 
    which the light of the sun could not penetrate; it was lighted by huge carbuncles. 
    In the midst of it was a sepulchre adorned with many strange images and inscriptions...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sixth Day was occupied by hard 
    work with furnaces and other alchemical apparatus. The alchemists succeeded 
    in creating life, in the form of the alchemical Bird (a Dove? an Eagle? a 
    Hawk)?...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ON THE SEVENTH AND LAST DAY, the 
    party gathered upon the shore preparing to leave in their Twelve Ships which 
    flew flags showing the signs of the Zodiac. The Virgin informed them that 
    they were &quot;Knights of the Golden Stone...A page read out from a book 
    the rules of the Order of the Golden Stone, which were:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1)...You, my Lords and Knights 
      shall swear that you will at no time ascribe your order either unto and 
      Devil or Spirit, but only to God, your Creator, and his hand-maid Nature.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2)...That you will abominate 
      all whoredom, incontinency, and uncleanness, and not defile your order with 
      such vices.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3)...That you, through your 
      talents, will be ready to assist all that are worthy and have need of them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4)...That you desire not to 
      employ this honour to wordly pride and high authority.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(5)...That you shall not be willing 
      to live longer than God will have you.</font></p>

  in the garden of Eden, when humanity<i> </i>first perceived the Singular Presence 
  (the ONENESS) of God in the whole of reality, that men's hearts and minds began 
  to look upwards in earnest, searching the heavens above for indications of this 
  great Reality. For the next two-thousand years (until Vedic and early Egyptian 
  times) the children of Adam would slowly lay the historical groundwork (the 
  Heaven-and-Earthwork) that would lead at last to the formulation of that great 
  Hermetic principle &quot;As above, so below.&quot; It would lead to those words

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">It has been generally believed that the science 
  of the heavens (astronomy), and the subsequent rise of astrology as an associative 
  discipline, had its earliest beginnings in Mesopotamia (in the time of Nimrod) 
  and in Egypt (during the reign of the Pharaohs). Mark Hurn, in a chapter of 
  his work entitled <i>The Historical Development of the Zodiac, </i>says:</font></p>
<blockquote> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For the earliest 
  recorded mention of the zodiac we must go to ancient Mesopotamia (roughly the 
  area of modern Iraq). The Mesopotamians (particularly the people of Babylon) 
  recorded astronomical events on clay tablets, many of which have been unearthed 
  by archaeologists. These tablets first record the use of the zodiac in the 5th 
  century BC. Other evidence for a Mesopotamian origin for the zodiac exists in 
  the types of animals chosen for the constellations (e.g. lions and scorpions). 
  From Mesopotamia the zodiac spread into Egypt and Greece. </font> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The earliest depiction of the zodiac 
    we have is from Egypt. The &#145;Dendera Zodiac&#146; is a carving on sandstone 
    from the temple of Hathor in Dendera. It is now held in the Louvre Museum, 
    Paris and is dated to the 1st century BC. It shows the twelve constellations 
    of the zodiac we are familiar with as well as the Egyptian system of &#145;decans&#146; 
    &#150; 36 constellations each representing ten days of the year.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another Egyptian depiction of the 
    zodiac can be found on the inside of a coffin lid found in West Thebes. It 
    depicts the sky goddess, Nut (often identified with the Milky Way) surrounded 
    by pictures of the signs of the zodiac. This is now held in the British Museum.The 
    famous Greek astronomer Hipparchus (who is credited with discovering precession) 
    was probably instructed by Babylonian astronomers and helped perpetuate the 
    usage of the zodiac in the Greek world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most influential astronomer 
    of the ancient world was Ptolemy who described the zodiac in his great book 
    on astronomy the Almagest. Since this one book dominated astronomy up to the 
    16th century, the zodiac was preserved through to modern times. But can we 
    take the history of the zodiac back further in history? That is to before 
    the 5th Century BC in Babylonia?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Russian professor of the history 
    of science, Alexander Gurshtein, has proposed a theory that the zodiac was 
    not originally twelve signs but just four. We have seen how there are four 
    important points on the ecliptic, the vernal equinox, the summer solstice, 
    the autumn equinox and the winter solstice. Gurshtein suggests that around 
    6-5000 BC these points were aligned with four constellations of the zodiac. 
    GEMINI vernal equinox...</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VIRGO 
    summer solstice...</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAGITTARIUS 
    autumn equinox...</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PISCES winter 
    solstice</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The effect of the precession of 
    the equinoxes over two thousand years then shifted these points out of these 
    constellations, and caused the early astronomers to make up new constellations, 
    so that by 4-3000 BC the position was: TAURUS vernal equinox...LEO summer 
    solstice...SCORPIUS autumn equinox ...AQUARIUS winter solstice</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 2000 years on and we move 
    into the arrangement we are familiar with: ARIES vernal equinox... </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CANCER 
    summer solstice...</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LIBRA autumn 
    equinox...</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CAPRICORNUS winter 
    solstice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a neat theory and evidence 
    supporting it is offered. Gurshtein looks at the size of constellations (in 
    square degrees) and suggests the older a constellation is, the bigger it is. 
    He demonstrates that the earliest constellations in his theory (Gemini, Virgo, 
    Sagittarius and Pisces) are on average larger than the next four (Taurus, 
    Leo, Scorpius and Aquarius) and the last four (Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricornus) 
    smaller still. He also uses evidence from Mesopotamian mythology; note how 
    the constellations marking the winter solstice are watery: Pisces (the fishes), 
    Aquarius (the water carrier) and Capricornus (the sea-goat). This, he suggests

  <p><b>The answer is quite evident. Pictures speak in all dialects. They speak

    visible stars were named. Certain ones arranged into groups by someone(s) 
    thoroughly familiar with the laws of astronomy. Those names and groupings

  <p><b>&quot;When God created the heavenly worlds He said, <i>and let them be 
    for signs</i>. A sign is something arbitararily selected and appointed to 
    represent some other thing. To make any sense of the creative record, we must 
    admit that God intended these orbs of light as expressions of some special 
    teaching; something different from what is naturally deducible from them.</b></p>
  <p><b>In the Book of Job (generally believed to be the oldest book in the Bible) 
    the names of several stars and constellations are mentioned as being both 
    ancient and well known...From repeated astronomical allusions contained in 
    the Book of Job, various mathematicians have calculated that Job lived and 
    wrote somewhere about 2150 B.C. This date would carry us back more than 1,000 
    years before Homer...And yet, in the time of Job, the heavens were already 
    chartered and arranged astronomically. The Zodiac existed, with constellations 
    and stars contained therein named; the figures drawn and recorded. Early Hebrews 
    were conversant with these star charts and were impressed with their significance...</b></p>
  <p><b>Job describes the power, majesty, and works of God. He informs us that 
    God is responsible for the naming and placing these constellations, <i>He 
    telleth the number of the stars; He calleth them all by their names</i>. (Psalm 
    147:4). A similar statement is made by the prophet Isaiah who declares: <i>Lift 
    up your eyes on high, and behold who created these (stars), that bringeth 
    out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of 
    his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth</i>. (Isaiah 40:26).</b></p>
  <p><b>In Genesis 15:5, the stars are spoken of as having been numbered (named) 
    before Abraham's time. Stars were used to (symbolically) to illustrate God's 
    promise to Abraham that his descendants would be an innumerable number: <i>And 
    he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the 
    stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy 
    seed be</i>...</b></p>
  <p><b>It is also a matter of inspired record that God gave Adam special revelations. 
    After the fall, God made known to Adam His purposes concerning the Serpent 
    and the Seed of the Woman. The revelation contained the whole Gospel including 
    the promises. This knowledge was not given to Adam/Manu solely for himself 
    (themselves) or his posterity. He was to make it known to all the races of 
    creation.</b></p>
  <p><b>This agrees with writings of the most honored of the ancient philosophers 
    and historians; those who delved the deepest into the origins of humanity. 
    Baleus wrote concerning Adam and (their) fellowship with God: 'He was the 
    first that discovered the motions of the celestial bodies and all other creatures.

  <p><b>Adam and his immediate descendants...had ample time for observations and 
    study; time to devise a means or recording and transmitting to all men the 
    Creator's plan for humanity. The canopy of virgin stars was over them, just 
    waiting to be named, grouped, and defined with certain symbols of the ideas 
    they wished to convey. In this way they could transmit and explain to their 
    posterity the names and figures assihned to each star-grouping. Among the 
    objects of Nature, none could have been selected as appropriately as the stars, 
    for the purpose of recording and conveying unchanging ideas to distant ages. 
    Their message was utterly imperishable as long as man was cognizant of the 
    Divine Nature of the Zodiac.</b></p>
  <p><b>According to the historian Josephus and more ancient recorders, Adam and 
    his son, Seth, are credited with the invention of letters </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The 
    earliest Hebrew-Phoenician letters)</font><b>. They were also the inventors 
    'of that peculiar wisdom which is concerned with the heavenly bodies, their

    and as their chief god - Marduk. Each year as winter arrived it was believed 
    that Marduk would do battle with the monsters of chaos. To assist Marduk in 
    his struggle the Mesopotamians held a festival for the New Year. This was 
    Zagmuk, the New Year's festival that lasted for 12 days. The Mesopotamian 
    king would return to the temple of Marduk and swear his faithfulness to the 
    god. The traditions called for the king to die at the end of the year and 
    to return with Marduk to battle at his side.</font></p>

    used the idea of a &quot;mock&quot; king. A criminal was chosen and dressed

    At the end of the celebration the &quot;mock&quot; king was stripped of the 
    royal clothes and slain, sparing the life of the real king.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Persians and the Babylonians 
    celebrated a similar festival called the Sacaea. Part of that celebration 
    included the exchanging of places, the slaves </font>(the spirit of antichrist 
    in the earth)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> would become the masters 
    and the masters were to obey. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Early Europeans believed in evil 
    spirits, witches, ghosts and trolls. As the Winter Solstice approached, with 
    its long cold nights and short days...SPECIAL RITUALS AND CELEBRATIONS WERE 
    HELD TO WELCOME BACK THE SUN.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Scandinavia during the winter 
    months the sun would disappear for many days. After thirty-five days scouts 
    would be sent to the mountain tops TO LOOK FOR THE RETURN OF THE SUN. WHEN 
    THE FIRST LIGHT WAS SEEN THE SCOUTS WOULD RETURN WITH THE GOOD NEWS. A great 
    festival would be held, called the Yuletide, and a special feast would be 
    served around a fire burning with the Yule log. Great bonfires would also 
    be lit to celebrate the return of the sun. IN SOME AREAS PEOPLE WOULD TIE 
    APPLES TO BRANCHES OF TREES TO REMIND THEMSELVES THAT SPRING AND SUMMER WOULD 
    RETURN.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ancient Greeks held a festival 
    similar to that of the Zagmuk/Sacaea festivals to assist their god Kronos 
    (Time) who would battle the god Zeus and his Titans. The Roman's celebrated 
    their god Saturn. Their festival was called Saturnalia which began the middle 
    of December and ended January 1st. With cries of &quot;Jo Saturnalia!&quot; 
    the celebration would include masquerades in the streets, big festive meals, 
    visiting friends, and the exchange of good-luck gifts called Strenae (lucky 
    fruits). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Romans decked 
    their halls with garlands of laurel and green trees lit with candles. Again 
    the masters and slaves would exchange places. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Jo Saturnalia!&quot; was 
    a fun and festive time for the Romans, but the Christians though it an abomination 
    to honor the pagan god. The early Christians wanted to keep the birthday of 
    their Christ child a solemn and religious holiday, not one of cheer and merriment 
    as was the pagan Saturnalia. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
    as Christianity spread they were alarmed by the continuing celebration of 
    pagan customs and Saturnalia among their converts. At first the Church forbid 
    this kind of celebration. But it was to no avail. Eventually it was decided 
    that the celebration would be tamed and made into a celebration fit for the 
    Christian Son of God. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some legends claim that the Christian 
    &quot;Christmas&quot; celebration was invented to compete against the pagan 
    celebrations of December. The 25th was not only sacred to the Romans but also 
    the Persians whose religion Mithraism was one of Christianity's main rivals 
    at that time. The Church eventually was successful in taking the merriment, 
    lights, and gifts from the Saturanilia festival and bringing them to the celebration 
    of Christmas.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exact day of the Christ child's 
    birth has never been pinpointed. Traditions say that it has been celebrated 
    since the year 98 AD. In 137 AD the Bishop of Rome ordered the birthday of 
    the Christ Child celebrated as a solemn feast. In 350 AD another Bishop of 
    Rome, Julius I, choose December 25th as the observance of Christmas.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mythology associated with the Pleiades cluster is extensive; Burnham alone 
    devotes eight pages to the subject, and Allen more than twice that number 
    (see references). Here only Greek legends are presented. Even so, these are 
    manifold and often contradictory, being patched together from many different 
    cultures over a long period of time. Further uncertainty is added by most 
    Pleiades sharing names with otherwise unrelated mythological characters. So 
    enjoy, but please do not consider this information to be infallible...</p>
  <p><b>POSSIBLE NAME DERIVATIONS:</b></p>
  <p><i>plein</i>, <b>`to sail', making Pleione `sailing queen' and her daughters 
    `sailing ones.'</b> <b>The cluster's conjunction with the sun in spring and 
    opposition in fall marked the start and end of the summer sailing season in 
    ancient Greece. </b></p>
  <p><i>pleos</i>, <b>`full', of which the plural is `many', appropriate for a 
    star cluster</b>. </p>
  <p><i>peleiades</i>, <b>`flock of doves', consistent with the sisters' mythological 
    transformation.</b> </p>
  <p><b>GENEOLOGY:</b></p>
  <p><b>The Pleiad(e)s were the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione</b>, and 
    half-sisters of the Hyades, <b>whose mother was &AElig;thra (`bright sky'</b>; 
    a different &AElig;thra than the mother of Theseus). <b>They were perhaps 
    also half-sisters of the Hesperides</b>, who were daughters of either Night 
    alone, or Atlas and Hesperis (`evening'), or Ceto and Phorcys. Both Pleione 
    and &AElig;thra were Oceanids, <b>daughters of Oceanus and Tethys, the titans 
    who ruled the outer seas before being replaced by Poseidon</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(See 
    Genesis 6:1-4)</font>. Atlas (`he who dares' or `suffers'; from the Indo-European 
    tel-, tla-, `to lift, support, bear'), another titan, led their war against 
    the gods, and was afterward condemned by Zeus to hold up the heavens on his 
    shoulders. The Pleiades were also nymphs in the train of Artemis, and together 
    with the seven Hyades (`rainmakers' or `piglets'; individual Hyad names are 
    not fully agreed upon) were called the Atlantides, Dodonides, or Nysiades, 
    nursemaids and teachers to the infant Bacchus. The Hesperides (`nymphs of 
    the west'), apparently not counted in this, were only three, and dwelled in 
    an orchard of Hera's, from which Heracles fetched golden apples in his eleventh 
    labor. </p>
  <p><b>INDIVIDUAL SISTERS</b></p>
  <p>For each, a name translation is given first, followed by available biographical 
    information, and parallel stories of like-named characters. </p>
  <p><b>Alcyone or Halcyone</b> - `queen who wards off evil [storms]' - Seduced 
    by Poseidon and gave birth to either Hyrieus (the name of Orion's father, 
    but perhaps not the same Hyrieus) or Anthas, founder of Anth&aelig;a, Hyperea, 
    and Halicarnassus. </p>
  <p><b>Another Alcyone</b>, daughter of &AElig;olus (guardian of the winds) and 
    &AElig;giale, married Ceyx of Trachis; the two jokingly called each other 
    Hera and Zeus, vexing those gods, who drowned Ceyx in a storm at sea; Alcyone 
    threw herself into the sea at the news, and was transformed into a halcyon 
    (kingfisher). Legend has it the halcyon hen buries her dead mate in the winter 
    before laying her eggs in a compact nest and setting it adrift on the sea; 
    &AElig;olus forbids the nest to be disturbed, so the water is calm for 14 
    days centered on the winter solstice, called the Halcyon Days. The actual 
    bird does not build nests however; instead <b>the story probably derives from 
    an old pagan observance of the turning season, with the moon-goddess conveying 
    a dead symbolic king of the old year to his resting place.</b> Though this 
    Alcyone and the Pleiad Alcyone appear to be separate individuals, they may 
    be related: in 2000 BC, a vigorous period of ancient astronomy, the Pleiades 
    rose nearly four hours earlier than they do today for the same time of year, 
    <b>and were overhead at nightfall on the winter solstice</b>, when the Halcyon 
    supposedly nested; <b>their conjunction with the sun during spring equinoxes 
    at that time may have something to do with the association of the cluster 
    with birds, which are often used as symbols of life and renewal. </b></p>
  <p><b>Asterope or Sterope</b> <b>- `lightning', `twinkling', `sun-face', `stubborn-face' 
    </b>(Indo-European ster-, `star', `stellar', `asterisk', etc.) - In some accounts, 
    ravished by Ares and gave birth to Oenomaus, king of Pisa. In others, Oenomaus 
    was her husband, and they had a beautiful daughter, Hippodaima, and three 
    sons, Leucippus, Hippodamus, and Dysponteus, founder of Dyspontium; or, Oenomaus 
    may instead have had these children with Euarete, daughter of Acrisius. Another 
    Asterope was daughter of the river Cebren. <b>Still another was daughter of 
    Portha&ouml;n, and may have been the mother of the Sirens, who lured sailors 
    to their deaths with their enchanting singing.</b> </p>
  <p>A possible alternate name is Asteri&euml; <b>(`of the starry sky' or `of 
    the sun')</b>, which may also be a name <b>for the creatrix of the universe</b>, 
    Eurynome, in the Pelasgian myth. Graves mentions her as a Pleiad only in passing, 
    with no other mention in the other references. Perhaps she was at one time 
    a Pleiad when different names were used, or an earlier version of Sterope, 
    whose name is similar; or perhaps Graves is incorrect. He also in passing 
    calls the titan or oak-goddess Dione a Pleiad, without explanation or corroboration. 
    Does the term have a broader meaning in some contexts? </p>
  <p><b>Cel&aelig;no - `swarthy'</b> - Had sons Lycus (``wolf'') and Chim&aelig;rus 
    (``he-goat'') by Prometheus. No other data. </p>
  <p><b>Electra or Eleckra - `amber', `shining', `bright'</b> (Indo-European wleik-, 
    `to flow, run', as a liquid); <b>electrum is an alloy of silver and gold, 
    and means amber in Latin</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(see 
    Ezekiel 1:4)</font>, as does the Greek elektron; Thales of Miletus noted in 
    600 BC that a rubbed piece of amber will attract bits of straw, a manifestation 
    of the effects of static electricity (outer charge stripping via friction), 
    and perhaps the origin of the modern term - Wife of Corythus; seduced by Zeus 
    and gave birth to Dardanus, founder of Troy, ancestor of Priam and his house. 
    Called Atlantis by Ovid, personifying the family. May also, by Thaumas, be 
    the mother of the Harpies, foul bird-women who lived in a Cretan cave and 
    harried criminals, but this could be a different ocean-nymph of the same name. 
  </p>
  <p>Another Electra was a daughter of Oedipus, though this may not be the same 
    Oedipus who killed his father and married his mother. <b>She is said to be 
    mother of DarDANus and Jason</b>. </p>
  <p>Yet another Electra was a daughter of Agamemnon and Clyt&aelig;mnestra, with 
    an alternate name of Laodice, and with brother Orestes and sisters Chrysothemis 
    and Iphigeneia (or Iphianassa), though the latter sister may have been Clyt&aelig;mnestra's 
    niece, adopted from Theseus and Helen. Agamemnon was king of Mycen&aelig; 
    and led the Greeks against Troy; he was murdered at his return by Clyt&aelig;mnestra 
    and her lover &AElig;gisthus, both of whom Orestes and Electra killed in revenge, 
    whence the psychological term `Electra complex'. This Electra was also wife 
    to the peasant Pylades, and bore him Medon and Strophius the Second. </p>
  <p><b>Maia - `grandmother', `mother', `nurse'; `the great one'</b> (Latin) - 
    Eldest and most beautiful of the sisters; a mountain nymph in Arcadia. Seduced 
    by Zeus <b>and gave birth to Hermes</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(And 
    therefore to Mercurius--Paul...Acts 14:12)</font>. Later became foster-mother 
    to Arcas, son of Zeus and Callisto, <b>during the period while Callisto was 
    a bear, and before she and Arcas were placed in the heavens by Zeus (she as 
    Ursa Major, he as either Bo&ouml;tes or Ursa Minor)</b>. </p>
  <p><b>Another Maia</b> was the Roman goddess of spring, daughter of Faunus and 
    wife of Vulcan (his Greek counterpart, Heph&aelig;stus, married Aphrodite 
    instead). <b>Farmers were cautioned not to sow grain before the time of her 
    setting, or conjunction with the sun. The month of May is named after her, 
    and is coincidentally(?) the month in which the solar conjunction happens. 
    By our modern calendar, the conjunction occurred in April in early Roman times, 
    with the shift since then due to the precession of the Earth's axis; but calendars 
    too have changed over time, especially before the time of Julius Caesar, so 
    the month and the cluster's solar conjunction may have lined up then as well.</b> 
  </p>
  <p><b>Merope - `eloquent', `bee-eater', `mortal'</b> - Married Sisyphus (se-sophos, 
    `very wise'), son of &AElig;olus, <b>grandson of Deucalion (the Greek Noah), 
    and great-grandson of Prometheus...</b></p>
  <p>Another Merope was daughter of Dionysus's son Oenopion, king of Chios; Orion 
    fell in love with her, and Oenopion refused to give her up, instead having 
    him blinded. Orion regained his sight and sought vengeance, but was killed 
    by Artemis, or by a scorpion, or by some other means (many versions). </p>
  <p><b>Taygete or Taygeta - ? tanygennetos, `long-necked' -</b> Seduced by Zeus 
    and gave birth to Laced&aelig;mon, founder of Sparta, to which she was thus 
    an important goddess. In some versions of the story, she was unwilling to 
    yield to Zeus, and was disguised by Artemis as a hind (female red deer) to 
    elude him; but he eventually caught her and begot on her Laced&aelig;mon, 
    whereupon she hanged herself. </p>
  <p>One day the great hunter Orion saw the Pleiads (perhaps with their mother, 
    or perhaps just one of them, as they walked through the Boeotian countryside, 
    and fancied them. <b>He pursued them for seven years</b>, <b>until Zeus answered 
    their prayers for delivery and transformed them into birds (doves or pidgeons), 
    placing them among the stars</b>. Later on, when Orion was killed (many conflicting 
    stories as to how), he was placed in the heavens behind the Pleiades, immortalizing 
    the chase. </p>
