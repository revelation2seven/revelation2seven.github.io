  One Crucial Issue in Pledge Case: What Does 'Under God' Mean?<br>
  By LINDA GREENHOUSE</b> </div>
<p align="left"><b>ASHINGTON, March 21, 2004&#151; It has taken 50 years since 
  Congress added &quot;under God&quot; to the Pledge of Allegiance for the validity 
  of that cold war amendment to reach the Supreme Court, with arguments scheduled 
  for Wednesday. But before the justices can decide whether those two words render 
  the pledge unconstitutional, they have to answer a factual question that is 
  inextricably entwined with the legal one: WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT MEAN TO PLEDGE 
  ALLEGIANCE TO &quot;ONE NATION UNDER GOD&quot;?</b></p>
<p><b>According to Michael A. Newdow, the California atheist who sued to stop 
  the recitation of the pledge in his daughter's elementary school classroom, 
  to recite the pledge with &quot;under God&quot; is to take &quot;one side in 
  the quintessential religious question `Does God exist?' &quot; a statement of 
  &quot;sectarian religious dogma&quot; that the government should not sponsor 
  in a public school setting.</b></p>
<p><b>According to the Bush administration, which is defending the pledge, its 
  recitation is no more a religious act than pocketing a coin imprinted with &quot;In 
  God We Trust.&quot; THE ADMINISTRATION'S BRIEF SAYS BOTH ARE SIMPLY PATRIOTIC 
  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF &quot;THE NATION'S RELIGIOUS HISTORY&quot; AND OF THE &quot;UNDENIABLE 
  HISTORICAL FACT THAT THE NATION WAS FOUNDED BY INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVED IN GOD,&quot; 
  an empirical statement that poses no threat to the separation of church and 
  state...</b></p>

  and French Revolutions. </b></p>
<p><b>According to the Christian Legal Society, a group of lawyers, judges and 
  professors, the pledge has a distinctly religious cast, and properly so. The 
  group's brief says that the words &quot;under God&quot; support the concept 
  of limited government, serving as a reminder that &quot;government is not the 
  highest authority in human affairs&quot; because &quot;inalienable rights come 
  from God.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>According to another group of religious individuals, 32 Christian and Jewish 
  clergy members who take the opposite side in the case, reciting the pledge with 
  &quot;under God&quot; invites a troubling kind of civic blasphemy. If children 
  are supposed to utter the phrase without meaning it as an affirmation of personal 
  faith, the group's brief asserts, &quot;THEN EVERYDAY, GOVERNMENT ASKS MILLIONS 
  OF SCHOOLCHILDREN TO TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD IN VAIN.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(EXACTLY)!</font></p>
<p><b>According to a form letter signed by President Bush and sent to those who 
  wrote the White House about the federal appeals court decision in June 2002 
  that declared the pledge unconstitutional, reciting the pledge is a way of proclaiming 
  &quot;our reliance on God&quot; and of &quot;humbly seeking the wisdom and blessing 
  of divine providence.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>This letter, clearly in some conflict with the current official view, concluded 
  by expressing the wish that &quot;the almighty continue to watch over the United 
  States of America.&quot; Americans United for Separation of Church and State 
  and other organizations that oppose the administration's position included the 
  letter in an appendix to their joint brief.</b></p>
<p><b>The striking range of views on just what &quot;under God&quot; signifies 
  represents only the beginning, not the end, of the justices' task as they take 
  up the case, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, No. 02-1624.</b></p>
<p><b>For example, if reciting the pledge is a religious act, is it a voluntary 
  or coerced one, and is that distinction even relevant? In 1992, the court prohibited 
  prayer led by the clergy at public high school commencement ceremonies on the 
  ground that the graduating students were effectively coerced into participating. 
  But a landmark Supreme Court decision from 1943 held that schoolchildren could 
  not be required to recite the pledge. One of Dr. Newdow's points is that even 
  if the pledge is nominally voluntary, daily classroom recitation inevitably 
  labels children who do not take part AS OUTSIDER.</b></p>
<p><b>If reciting the pledge is seen AS A PATRIOTIC STATEMENT OF HOMAGE TO THE 
  FOUNDING FATHERS, does that make it less problematic or more? Prof. Douglas 
  Laycock of the University of Texas law school, speaking here Friday at the Pew 
  Forum on Religion and Public Life, said that seen in that light, the message 
  of the pledge is that &quot;if you're doubtful about the existence of God, you 
  are of doubtful loyalty to the nation.&quot; Professor Laycock represents the 
  32 clergy members who oppose the pledge.</b></p>
<p><b>If &quot;under God&quot; is unconstitutional, what is the fate of numerous 
  other examples of religious references scattered throughout civic life AND LONG 
  ACCEPTED AS A BENIGN FORM OF &quot;CEREMONIAL DEISM&quot;?</b></p>
<p><b>Jay A. Sekulow, speaking at the same forum, said that even the Supreme Court 
  marshal's intonation of &quot;God save the United States and this honorable 
  court&quot; would be suspect. </b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, a 
  legal organization affiliated with the Rev. Pat Robertson, filed a brief on 
  behalf of several dozen members of Congress who back the pledge as it is written, 
  as well as 250,000 people who signed a supporting petition.</b></p>
<p><b>Justice Antonin Scalia has recused himself, raising the prospect of a 4-to-4 
  tie. His recusal, announced in October when the court accepted the case, stemmed 
  from a speech he gave last year that pointedly criticized the lower court's 
  reasoning.</b></p>
<p><b>Aside from the terrorism-related cases that will be argued next month, there 
  is probably no more heavily freighted issue on the court's current docket than 
  this one. Politicians touch the pledge at their peril: few have forgotten the 
  1988 presidential campaign, when George Bush, then the vice president, scored 
  easy points by denouncing the veto that his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael 
  S. Dukakis, had cast of a bill requiring Massachusetts teachers to lead their 
  classes in the pledge.</b></p>
<p><b>The attorneys general of all states have signed a brief supporting the pledge, 
  as have the National School Boards Association and the National Education Association, 
  the teachers' union.</b></p>
<p><b>The visibility of the pledge as a political issue faded after 1988, only 
  to flare up again nearly two years ago, when Dr. Newdow, who has law and medical 
  degrees and who argued his own case, won a 2-to-1 decision from the United States 
  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, that the pledge was 
  unconstitutional. The court later narrowed its ruling to bar only recitation 
  in public school classrooms.</b></p>
<p><b>Dr. Newdow will argue his case before the justices. He will be opposed by 
  Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson and Terence J. Cassidy, counsel for the 
  Elk Grove district, near Sacramento, where Dr. Newdow's daughter attends school.</b></p>
<p><b>A preliminary question, which will be part of the arguments on Wednesday, 
  is whether Dr. Newdow, who was never married to the girl's mother and is not 
  the custodial parent, has standing to pursue the case. The mother, Sandra L. 
  Banning, has filed a brief supporting the pledge and her daughter's recitation 
  of it. A decision that Dr. Newdow lacks standing would wipe out the lower court's 
  ruling, but not the emotion the case has generated or the potential that a different 
  plaintiff might renew the debate in the next case.</b></p>
