<p align="center"><font size="+1">FOR THE DAY SHALL COME (AND IS FINALLY HERE)...Malachi, 
  chapter 4. (KJV).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">And there shall be upon every high mountain 
    </font> </i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(upon every great nation)</font><font size="+1"><i>, 
    and every high hill, rivers and streams of waters IN THE DAY OF THE GREAT

  <p><i><font size="+1">Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of 
    war draw near; let them come up...</font></i><font size="+1">(Joel 3:9). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And now that the Day has come, why are we surprised? And though 
  the scripture says: <i>As a snare shall the day come upon all who dwell upon 
  the earth</i> (Luke 21:35), we knew that it would come as a snare, and we should 
  have been ready. We have been informed of it since the beginning of this age, 
  since the time of Christ (1 Thessalonians 5, for instance; or Hebrews, chapter 
  12). And not only that, but God has filled the streets of New York City for 
  years, with prophets and fools, proclaiming the day. And from the purely-social, 
  intellectual and non-religious sectors of this society there has been an ongoing 
  conversation concerning America's oppressive (fascist), relationship to the 
  other nations, and poorer peoples of the earth. So why is there confusion and 
  uncertainty now that these final wars are underway, that America's judgments 
  have begun, that the Divine Presence is risen up everywhere in the earth and 
  the time has come?...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> But the American religion has its own prophets and teachers, 
  men of great renown, television personalities, and religious prelates, those 
  close to the seats of power, all the prophets of Ba'al (not to fail to mention 
  the incessant messages from the sports and entertainment industries, and all 
  the other commercial interests and media that attend them--&quot;weapons of 
  mass distraction&quot; as some have put it), who have been able to assure the 
  people otherwise, to keep the great number of us as they could, confident in 
  the American state of mind, and unaware of the destruction that was coming (and 
  which is still yet to come...2 Peter 2, the Book of Jude)...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>Isaiah 13 and 14; Isaiah 47; Jeremiah 25; Jer.50 and 51</b>.</p>
<p><font size="+1"> We have been informed of it since ancient times, since the 
  time of that <i>merlin</i>, Samuel, and the other Druid prophets (1 Samuel 2:1-10; 
  and Isaiah, chapters 1 to 5, which speak directly to the founding of the American 
  nation, as does 1 Peter, chapter 2). The Book of Joel, chapters 2 and 3 refers 
  directly to those things that have been unfolding before our very eyes; as well 
  as Amos [3:1-8]; and the books of Micah and Habakkuk. All of the books of the 
  prophets speak directly to these times.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Moses saw far ahead into our days and to the Foot of this mystery, 
  and told us of it (Deuteronomy 32, KJV), and, indeed, also left us with a complete 
  vision of the 20th century in the nineteenth chapter of Exodus (compare Exodus 
  19:8-14 and Revelation 7:13-17). John the Baptist and Paul, likewise, looked 
  into our times and warned us of them:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/FeetOfThem1.gif" width="678" height="450"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> We have been informed of it since Vedic times, when God said 
  to Abraham and Sarai (to the adepts in the mysteries of Brahma and Sarasvati) 
  that their seed would be a stranger in a land that was not theirs (America), 
  and that after the time of their captivity (our captivity), God would bring 
  a judgment upon that nation and their children out of this judgment with a great 
  substance. (Genesis 15:12-16, Isaiah 66). These judgments are now underway. 
  And from the time of Adam, when God set a mark upon the spirit of Cain when 
  this older brother rose up and slew his younger brother Abel. (Genesis 4:1-16; 
  Ecclesiastes 3:14-21; Revelation 13:16,17). This &quot;mark,&quot;--imbedded 
  in the mind, and defining the deeds of every soul who makes war, or kills, or 
  exacts vengeance, or executes another human being in the Name of the God of 
  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, or who consents to those who do it in their own name--is 
  not something that's coming, it symbolizes the very-present state of consciousness--the 
  state of spiritual captivity--of the American people themselves. That they do 
  not even know they are slaves, to the illusions of the lower, material order 
  of creation, to the demonic and violent self-interests of the leaders of this 
  nation, speaks to the severe nature of the bondage itself.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Their faces long with disapproval, 
    the anchors announced that the reason for the war had finally been uncovered 
    by the Senate Intelligence Committee, AND IT WAS &quot;GROUPTHINK,&quot; NOT 
    TO MENTION &quot;COLLECTIVE GROUP THINK.&quot;...This is a surprise? Groupthink 
    has become as American as apple pie and prisoner abuse; in fact, it's hard 
    to find any thinking these days that doesn't qualify for the prefix &quot;group.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our standardized-test-driven schools 
    reward the right answer, not the unsettling question. Our corporate culture 
    prides itself on individualism, but it's the &quot;team player&quot; with 
    the fixed smile who gets to be employee of the month. In our political culture, 
    the most crushing rebuke is to call someone &quot;out of step with the American 
    people.&quot;...I trace the the current outbreak of droidlike conformity to 
    the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when groupthink became the official substitute 
    for patriotism, and we began to run out of surfaces for affixing American 
    flags. Bill Maher lost his job for pointing out that, whatever else they were, 
    the 9/11 terrorists were not cowards, prompting Ari Fleischer to warn (though 
    he has since backed down) that Americans &quot;need to watch what they say.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Societies throughout history have 
    recognized the hazards of groupthink and made arrangements to guard against 
    it. The shaman, the wise woman and similar figures all represent institutionalized 
    outlets for alternative points of view. In the European carnival tradition, 
    a &quot;king of fools&quot; was permitted to mock the authorities, at least 
    for a day or two. In some cultures, people resorted to vision quests or hallucinogens--anything 
    to get out of the box. Because, while the capacity for groupthink is an endearing 
    part of our legacy as social animals, it is also a common precondition for 
    self-destruction. One thousand coalition soldiers have died because the C.I.A. 
    was so eager to go along with the emperor's delusion that he was actually 
    wearing clothes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instead of honoring groupthink 
    resisters, we subject them to insult and abuse. Sgt. Samuel Provance has been 
    shunned by fellow soldiers since speaking out against the torture at Abu Ghraib...(and) 
    the list goes on...This nation was not founded by habitual groupthinkers. 
    But it stands a fair chance of being destroyed by them. </font>The New York

<p><font size="+1">The Creators have brought us full-circle back to the beginning 
  of this entire epic, from ancient Eden back to Eden again, from Genesis to Revelation 
  (to see, as it is, if we have indeed learned the subtle difference that exists 
  between <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i>, and how to distinguish between them). It 
  is revealed in both the words of the prophets (Isaiah 40:21-26), and the corresponding 
  structure of historical reality. Yet now we are amazed that it is all coming 
  to pass. If we did not already know, we would wonder how--in America, a land 
  wherein we have had so much access, not only to the material things of the world 
  (which as we see, in the hands of worldlings has become a curse upon the American 
  landscape), but to the Word of God--that we were not also acutely aware that 
  we in America were the subject of it all--at least at <i>this </i>moment in 
  time. For it is in America, more than any other place on earth, that the old 
  is coming to its conclusion, and the new is being born. (Revelation 12:1,2; 
  John 16:20-25). The Light and the Darkness are both coming to their own mutual 
  states of perfection, the one from the other, here in America. Yet, what is 
  the reality:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> <i>The</i> <i>lie</i> consists in our time of the belief that 
  the doctrines of Christianity and the doctrines of America are somehow one and 
  the same, and are fulfilled in each other (which they are in every converse 
  and paradoxical sense), and that to be a good, loyal and patriotic American 
  is to be a good Christian, or a good Jew, or Muslim, or Hindu...when in reality 
  the precepts and teachings of each of these religious traditions are directly 
  inimical to the founding principles of the American nation, and have warned 
  of God's judgments (the unfolding of Karmic Law) against them since the beginning. 
  We have instead, been commanded to be good citizens of the world, to be the 
  servants, and the light of God's love, and God's wisdom, to all the peoples 
  of the earth--not to America, or any one nation or principality alone--and certainly 
  not <i>as</i> agents of the American state of mind, but of God. (Which is why 
  many American missionaries are under suspicion in various places throughout 
  the earth. They are seen as agents of the American political and economic order...which 
  many of them are). We were commanded to be <i>separate</i> from every nation, 
  and thus <i>The Light</i> in the midst of them all. But we have violated this 
  covenant, forsaken the Law and the Prophets, and, in Christ, no longer walk 
  in the ways of the teachings of Christ. And because we have traded God's Light 
  for this present darkness (the American Darkness--the Darkness of <i>Zionism</i> 
  in all of its natural and earthly-political forms), the spiritual for the material, 
  God is rising up in the sum of all these natural and human events to reignite 
  it. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Nor do these things have to do with being anti-American, or 
  seditious in the purely political sense of the term, regardless of what those 
  who have the power to sway public opinion may say (for we are all the children 
  of our times, and know fully that only out of the American experience could 
  the true spiritual Nation be born--or reborn). But they have to do with obeying 
  God, and fearing God. Were not these the objectives of <i>some</i> of the earliest 
  of those who came upon these shores, long before the ideas got twisted and the 
  merchant, warrior class took control of the oracles of God? (I prefer the doctrines 
  of Roger Williams who taught that the Church had no right to interfere in the 
  private lives of private individuals, to determine who could or could-not participate 
  in the local body-politic, and, at the same time, that neither did the State 
  (the local body-politic) possess any right to interfere in the spiritual lives 
  of believing individuals. His doctrines, as Christ's, set the children of Light 
  free from both, the worldly, apostate church and the State). Nevertheless, whose 
  heart did not tremble on the morning of September 11th (even though we saw it 
  coming)? Who does not lament for the police and firefighters, and for all the 
  others that perished in the fiery collapse of the World Trade Center? But who 
  also does not realize that those who perished that morning were in the midst 
  of a <i>Theophany</i>, the very Divine Presence of God itself... </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also 
    of the hills moved and were shaken, because He was wroth.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">There went up a smoke out of His nostrils, and fire out 
    of His mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness 
    was under His feet.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, He did fly 
    upon the wings of the wind </font></i><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
    Divine Kamikaze)</font><font size="+1">...(Psalm 18:6-10; Deuteronomy 32:17-25; 
    Isaiah 66:15-18).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> And who will not continue to lament now for the young men 
  and women who will begin to be killed on those battlefields? But also for all 
  the others, adults and children alike, who are already perishing? And for the 
  thousands upon thousands who have already perished in the earth as a result 
  of American foreign policy? Bush and Cheney will not lament, nor did those who 
  preceded them, for they are determined <i>at all costs</i> to defend the American 
  way of life--as they know it that is. (And who, by the way, gave them the authority 
  to use us as they do, to mobilize us and send us to war)? What they know of 
  America, however, is limited to their own sense of the acquired rights and privileges 
  of the American capitalist class, the very same that God is now rising against. 
  (James, chapter 5, Ecclesiastes 5:8-13). The rest of us know America as it really 
  is. We were raised in its streets, in its cities and towns. We have labored 
  in its places of business, its fields, and in its factories and mills. We have 
  even (against our own teachings) served in its military services. We have kneeled 
  in its places of worship, we have played its games, gone to its picnics, attended 
  its pastimes, sat in its taverns and have sung its songs. We have also sat in 
  each other's living rooms, and at each other's kitchen tables. We have raised 
  our families as best as we could, given our understanding of things, despite 
  the manipulations of the ruling class. They have no idea what we have been discussing 
  there, or how the Spirit has been instructing us. We understand the struggle. 
  We also honour our parents. Being faithful and obedient to their own times, 
  and without knowing it, made our times and the true spiritual revolution possible.

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Those of us in our generation (the <i>Remnant </i>in our time,<i> 
  and how shall I liken it</i>? the Scriptures ask), have traveled the length 
  and breadth of the land, we have walked and hitchhiked across the expanse of 
  the country itself, slept in its shelters and along its roadsides, bathed in 
  its streams, and prayed at all of its sacred sites. We have raised our arms 
  in adoration at the summits of its mountains, and have sat in deep reflection 
  at its shores. We have listened to its ancestral voices, and have learned its 
  mysteries. We have even visited its most famous battlefields, and many of its 
  other most darkest places. We have tasted the good and the evil among men. We 
  know that America is a violent nation, that it is founded in sedition and violence 
  (in spiritual lawlessness), and that this land is a stolen land, and that it 
  must be given back. And we now know exactly what it's like to live at the end 
  of an age...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It is not just America, however, but the whole history of <i>man</i> 
  that is being judged here, the whole history of warfare and killing (James, 
  chapter 4), and the whole history of oppression and injustice in the Name of 
  God, of which America is more than guilty--ten times more guilty than all others 
  nations because of its outright profession of the principles of Christ. (Ecclesiastes 
  3:15,16). These great judgments, which began to be visited upon the seed of 
  Adam at the conclusion of the last great Atlantean age (in the time of the patriarchs, 
  5,000 years ago), are concluding now, against all that the seed of Adam--in 
  violation of the teachings of Adam--has ultimately become. Bush and Cheney, 
  and all the great leaders of modern Atlantis (NATO), would sacrifice as many 
  of our sons and daughters, and brothers and sisters, as it takes to keep God 
  from destroying them and their way of life again, from staining <i>America's 
  honor</i> as they have put it--all in the face of those words which say: <i>For 
  that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

    world, against spiritual wickedness in high places...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ephesians 
    6:12). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We wrestle against ourselves, against the conditions of our 
  own spiritual ignorance, and then against those who would keep us subject to 
  that state of ignorance. Listen! the Master of the Universe--The Lord of History--He 
  and She who is ALL that Exists, and the Creators of All else that exists--is 
  not an American. Nor is God a capitalist. Thus we can not imagine it is acceptable 
  to be any of those things that God is not (and especially to be found fighting 
  and killing for the right to be them), and be created in Their image at the 
  same time. It is simple spiritual logic (Genesis 2:27). Read the scriptures, 
  check the history books. Find out where we have been led astray. What God is, 
  however, is Terrible--terrible in His insistence that we who are called by Their 
  Name walk righteously in the earth: <i>Justice shalt thou perform. </i></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But God now has a people in the earth who <i>are</i> capable 
  of performing that justice, of living with Godly purpose and simplicity in the 
  earth (in the Eightfold path of righteousness), and of dedicating their whole 
  lives to the restoration and healing of the planet and its peoples...and of 
  keeping this wholeness intact throughout every future generation--through love, 
  not fear; in (true) freedom, not coercion. (The spiritual values that have brought 
  us to our present state of consciousness, are the very same as we shall carry 
  with us over the threshold and into the future). God began to raise up this 
  people in all of the social upheavals of the 1950s and 60s in America (and elsewhere 
  of course), and on the Jewish side of the Tree of Life, in that remnant's unfailing 
  resistance to the existence of the Zionist state. Thus God is now rising up 
  in all of the events of our time to bring this people to power, to deliver them, 
  out of the darkness of this age into the light of the age to come. Just as God 
  is known by the judgments He executes, Their sons and daughters are known by 
  the love they have for the things of God, for the Truth, and by the love they 
  have for one another and all others. How is it written: <i>THIS DAY have I begotten 
  thee. </i>(Psalm 2:7).</font></p>

  in the West every evening, so the age we are presently living in was born in 
  the East, at the time of Passover, about 2,000 years (or forty jubilees of years) 
  ago. Passover is a Seven-day observance (Leviticus 23:1-8; Exodus 12 and 13). 
  We have now come these Seven epic days to where the Sun is setting in the West, 
  at the time of the High Holy Days, in the midst of all the unfolding realities 
  of our own time (Leviticus 23:23-44, Joel 2). We have come to the end of this 
  age, to the fulness of these times and to all of the contractions and birth 
  pains of the age-to-come. As the Father rises up in the East, in all of the 
  epic manifestations of the sign of the Ram, to end this age, the Divine Mother, 
  Holy Wisdom Herself, is descending to us here in the West giving birth to Her 
  next Child. (Do not be confused by the World-church's own fruitless insistence 
  that it is <i>their</i> Mary that the Scripture is speaking of--although it 
  is, but in a way that the World-church can not understand. Mary [meaning the 
  Sea, the Waters of Life], <i>Holy Theotokas </i>Herself, is only one of the 
  many forms the Divine Mother has clothed Herself in since ancient times.There 
  is more than one Mary). This Child is being born in the hearts and minds of 
  every single soul, every indigenous person, every Christian, Jew, Hindu, Muslim, 
  Buddhist, and all others alike, who can understand these things, and who have 
  come to these times walking in the perfections of their own faith, and in their 
  own understanding of the presence of the Divine Mother. It all leads to the 
  same state of Universal Christ-Consciousness...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Why is She clothed in the Sun? Because She has been hiding 
  Herself in the light of this great Western mystery all this time, in the light 
  of Her own creation. She has been allowing history to come to its foreordained 
  conclusions, the evil in humanity as well as the good, as it is also written: 
  <i>For the mystery of Iniquity </i>(of imbalance) <i> doth already work</i>. 
  (2 Thessalonians 2:7). She is not only the Divine <i>Shekinah</i>, She is the 
  Goddess of all indigenous peoples in the earth. She was not only the keeper 
  of the Grail and the Sword <i>Excalibur </i>(Ephesians 6:17), She is also the 
  Spider Woman and the keeper of the Sacred Pipe (whose very stem is a symbol 
  of the Central Pillar of the Tree of Life. It is along this Central Pillar that 
  She unites all Her sons and daughters in the earth). She is the Royal Mother 
  of the Kunlun Mountains, <i>Hsi-wang-mu</i>, the Taoist Paradise of the West. 
  She is Mother Africa, millions of Her children are here. She has brought them. 
  She has brought all of us together to this present time in history, and to this 
  present place on earth...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But why is the moon under Her feet? Because the moon, always 
  a symbol for the Divine Feminine Principle of Life, has also been considered 
  less than, or inferior to the Male Principle. She has this notion under Her 
  feet now. Why is She crowned in the majesty of the Universe? Because She is 
  God. Along with the Great Father, They have given birth to all that exists (please 
  see the 5th chapter of this work), and to all that is coming to birth--the next 
  stage of human consciousness. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Having arrived at the sign of the Balances, at the observances 
  of the Great Seventh Month, we can now look back over the last two thousand 
  years and plainly see how the world has come to be so presently <i>out of balance</i>. 
  Not only has God (in Their infinite wisdom), purposefully allowed the powerful 
  and the violent to come to power in the earth--the warring class over the children 
  of peace, the empires of men over the empire of the Soul, and thus needless 
  to say, the rich over the poor, the lower mind over the higher--but for the 
  last two thousand years in particular the Spirit has allowed the Male principle 
  to rule over the Female principle. And while it has been a difficult thing to 
  behold, how else could God have made us to see what a world out-of-balance, 
  and a spiritual world turned upside down, looks like? without revealing it, 
  both to us and in us? And now we see it and can begin to bid it all good riddance. 
  Of course it is not all that simple. It is a very powerful illusion that God 
  has created and it will not &quot;stand down&quot; as it is, on its own. (Revelation 
  12:13-17). Therefore God must rise up in a force equal to it, to consume it...Thus 
  it is East against West, West against East. The Zionist state of America, and 
  the Zionist state of Israel, both of them entangled against the entire Islamic 
  world. Literally all of them against each other and themselves, as it is written: 
  <i>Cast out the bondwoman and her son </i> (all of her sons), (Galatians 4:21-31).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And, of course, there is Russia and China, these two great, 
  colossal <i>angelic</i> nations. <i>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent 
  forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation? </i>(Hebrews 1:14; 
  2 Thessalonians 1:5-10). And Japan? How else shall we be delivered from such 
  a powerful economic system, and a state of mind, that has us firmly in its grips? 
  <i>For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together...And 
  that all things are working together for good to them that love God, and who 
  are called according to God's purposes</i>...(Romans 8:18-28).</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;People ask me, 'Do you really 
    believe that Jesus Christ is going to come back to this earth again?' Yes, 
    I do. The Bible teaches that Jesus is coming again. I don't see any other 
    hope for the world, because we seem to be heading toward a catastrophe.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">What is wrong with the following message by Billy Graham? If 
  these are the last times, as Billy Graham believes, and if all the events unfolding 
  in the earth today are the signs of Christ's imminent return, then just where 
  in the world are Billy Graham's antichrists? Bin Laden? He is a Muslim. Kofi 
  Anan? He does not profess to be a follower of Christ. Does not Billy Graham 
  understand that judgment begins <i>in</i> the house of God? Does he not understand 
  the words which say, <i>He that forsakes the law </i>(consorts with) <i>the 
  wicked</i>? Or those that say: <i>For this cause God shall send them strong 
  delusion, that they should believe a lie...</i>(2 Thessalonians 2:1-12; 2 Corinthians 
  11:1-15...KJV).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GRAHAM: &quot;The Bible says, 'First 
    of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing 
    and following their own evil desires. They will say, Where is this &quot;coming&quot; 
    He promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since 
    the beginning of creation. But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's 
    words the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of the water and by 
    water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. 
    By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being 
    kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.' (2 Peter 3:3-7 
    NIV). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other words, a judgment 
    is going to come on this earth, and it will be a judgment of fire. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For years people believed that 
    the threat of a nuclear holocaust was diminishing, but nuclear tests have 
    again raised fears that an incident somewhere in the world can still plunge 
    us into global catastrophe. And now we hear talk of 'dirty bombs,' which could 
    spread radiation and affect thousands.</font></p>
  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    keeps a 'Doomsday Clock' that measures the extent of nuclear peril we face. 
    At this writing the clock stands at seven minutes to midnight--two minutes 
    closer to potential destruction than the clock read in 1998 and seven minutes 
    closer than it did in 1995. Almost everyone would agree that the end of the 
    world as we know is a possibility scientifically. But while we may speculate 
    about possibilities, the Word of God speaks about certainties...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what does the Bible tell us 
    about the end of the world and the Second Coming of Christ?Jesus said, 'As 
    it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.'
