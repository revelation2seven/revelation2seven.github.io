  <p> This survey appears in the January 16, 2004 issue of Executive Intelligence 
    Review. <br>
    CAMPAIGN 2004: WHERE THEY STAND<br>
    Military Policy:<br>
    Defense of the Nation in a<br>
    Time of Global Economic Crisis<br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is Part 3 in a series of documentary comparisons of the views 
    of the 2004 Democratic Presidential contenders. The topics are those raised 
    by Lyndon LaRouche's candidacy since Jan. 1, 2001, and therefore we place 
    him first. The other candidates are listed in the order of the number of their 
    itemized campaign contributions. (LaRouche is number two by this count.) Part 
    1, in EIR of Dec. 12, 2003, dealt with the Iraq War and the Cheney neo-conservative 
    coup (we touch on Iraq policy in what follows below, but see Part 1 for more 
    details); Part 2, in EIR of Dec. 26, 2003, was on economic policy. Part 4, 
    in EIR of Jan. 30, 2004, is on Attorney General John Ashcroft and the threat 
    of police-state rule. Part 5 is on how to reverse the breakdown of the United 
    States' economic infrastructure. Part 6 is on the Middle East Crisis. Marcia 
    Merry Baker, Roch Steinbach, and Susan Welsh prepared this report.</p>
  <p>Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr.<br>
    Military Doctrine/Strategic Defense</p>
  <p>LaRouche has for three decades been a unique spokesman for a Classical conception 
    of strategic defense, as the cornerstone of military policy for the United 
    States. Strategic Defense combines economic and scientific/technological progress; 
    the developing skill levels of the population; and a foreign policy based 
    on fostering a community of sovereign nation-states, to form a coherent military 
    policy which is the opposite of the currently predominant &quot;utopian&quot; 
    conception.</p>
  <p>LaRouche was the conceptual author of the policy which became known as Ronald 
    Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. LaRouche had elaborated a program for 
    anti-ballistic missile defense, based on technologies using &quot;new physical 
    principles,&quot; which would involve cooperation between the United States 
    and Soviet Union, to end the Cold War&#151;the age of Mutual and Assured Destruction 
    (MAD)&#151;and replace it with a doctrine of Mutual and Assured Survival. 
    This, he conceived as a &quot;science-driver,&quot; which would revive the 
    moribund economy of the Soviet Union; shift the economies of the West toward 
    high-technology, capital-intensive production; and raise the skill levels 
    and living standards of the Third World. Most recently, LaRouche discussed 
    the history of that policy fight in a Dec. 12, 2003 webcast from Washington, 
    D.C.:</p>
  <p>&quot;I'd been working on this since 1977. The idea was that if the United 
    States and Soviet Union could agree on the development of certain technologies 
    which existed scientifically, that in itself would not prevent a nuclear attack, 
    but the fact that they had agreed to develop such systems would change the 
    policy away from Mutual and Assured Destruction to a new policy. And this 
    would work, particularly if we would use these technologies&#151;which had 
    multiple uses, shall we say&#151;to help developing countries as well as benefit 
    in terms of military application. Reagan, who, apart from all his other problems, 
    was actually a Roosevelt Democrat by breeding, was struck on this.</p>
  <p>&quot;On economics, he was unreachable. You couldn't touch him on economics; 
    he was just gone. And also, of course, he adapted to Truman and the right 
    wing, in Hollywood, famously, in the post-war period. But on this thing, the 
    SDI, he agreed. There has to be an alternative to MAD.</p>
  <p>&quot;So, I was then put in a situation of back-channel discussion with the 
    Soviet Union on exploring this possibility. Reagan at some point&#151;I don't 
    know exactly what point, I think it might have been around January of 1983&#151;finally 
    decided to go with it, and had a meeting with people to make sure that he 
    would say in his speech&#151;in a five-minute segment of his March 23, 1983 
    speech&#151;that he would say in that speech exactly what I had been saying 
    to the Soviet government in these back-channel discussions. He said it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well, Andropov turned it down.&quot;</p>
  <p>Preventive War.</p>
  <p>In an Oct. 22, 2003 webcast, from Washington, D.C., LaRouche also addressed 
    strategic defense policy, denouncing the doctrine of preventive, or pre-emptive 
    war:</p>
  <p>&quot;Instead of the lunacy of nuclear preventive war, especially the preventive 
    nuclear war policies revived by Vice-President Cheney, we must return to that 
    principle of strategic defense which was introduced by Carnot and employed 
    by Scharnhorst, a principle has been the policy of all of our great Presidents 
    and military commanders, such as MacArthur and Eisenhower, since. Among these 
    lessons learned were the emphasis upon the role of an Army Corps of Engineers, 
    and the importance of shifting the training of soldiers and sailors to the 
    principle of mission-orientation introduced under Scharnhorst.&quot;</p>
  <p>Asymmetric Warfare, &quot;Mini-Nukes.&quot;</p>
  <p>Since the announcement of a pre-emptive warfare strategy by the Bush-Cheney 
    Administration&#151;including pre-emptive nuclear war&#151;LaRouche has discussed 
    the measures of &quot;asymmetric warfare&quot; that nations that are possible 
    targets of such warfare will take, in their own defense. He outlined the general 
    idea in an Aug. 17, 2003 campaign policy paper, &quot;World Nuclear War When? 
    McAuliffe's Deadly Delusions: or, How Harry Truman Defeated Himself&quot;:</p>
  <p>&quot;Take one relatively obvious example of the kind of systems and their 
    measures presently in the making,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Take relatively very 
    small, very quiet submarines, much quieter than today's nuclear-powered military 
    submarines, smaller submarines loaded with small objects to deposit in places 
    relatively most difficult for defenses to detect. Or, consider very, very 
    deep-diving submarines which can do special tricks. Meanwhile, nuclear and 
    thermonuclear devices can be produced in a wide range of effects, many of 
    these relatively small. Also, there are possibilities for producing global 
    effects, which we, then involved in the proposed SDI, had considered, back 
    during the mid-1980s, in our defining of the requirements to alter the environment 
    for short, but significant intervals of time; that, on a relatively large 
    scale.</p>
  <p>&quot;The point being illustrated by the references made, is that there are 
    many ways in which the U.S.A. nuclear Triad can be made relatively, asymmetrically 
    obsolete; as by, in effect, bypassing it with warfare in a different technological 
    space than it is designed to fight. This is not a matter of a particular weapons-system, 
    but it could be a matter of a threatened adversary's dreaming up a feasible 
    technological dimension which you, perhaps, had simply not thought about....</p>
  <p>&quot;The rampant incompetence in military and related matters shown by Bush 
    Administration economists generally, and by Cheney's and Rumsfeld's pack of 
    neo-conservatives&#151;and, in that context, in events such as the recent, 
    not really very secret meeting in [Offutt Air Force Base] Nebraska&#151;demonstrates 
    that any notion of an assumed invincible strategic doctrine in the intentions 
    of these characters, is such that any capable, otherwise weaker nation, is 
    intrinsically capable of discovering how to defeat it, if they have not already 
    defined such solutions.&quot;</p>
  <p>In a speech on Nov. 1, 2003, LaRouche spelled out the danger of the Cheney 
    policy, and particularly the Pentagon discussion of using mini-nuclear weapons 
    today: &quot;We live in a world,&quot; he said, &quot;in which thermonuclear 
    weapons, and related things, define an environment of Mutual and Assured Destruction, 
    really. Now, what is Cheney talking about, therefore? What's the problem we're 
    living under? What Cheney is talking about, and others are talking about&#151;the 
    neo-cons&#151;is: Let's have a sub-Mutual and Assured Destruction regime. 
    Let us conduct nuclear warfare, in such a way, that we never go to full-scale 
    thermonuclear war, but that we use mini-nukes, and other kinds of weapons 
    of mass destruction, in order to find a level between what used to be called 
    'conventional warfare'&#151;pre-nuclear warfare&#151;and thermonuclear warfare, 
    generally. So therefore, to find a 'middle area' to fight limited nuclear 
    warfare, as preventive nuclear warfare: to establish a world empire; to eliminate 
    all nation-states, and establish imperial control over the planet, by this 
    method.&quot;</p>
  <p>Universal Service</p>
  <p>LaRouche has been an opponent of the &quot;all-volunteer Army&quot; since 
    its inception, and an advocate of universal military service. As a Democratic 
    Presidential contender back in 1979, he issued a Presidential Campaign Paper 
    titled Military Policy of the LaRouche Administration, in which he described 
    the all-volunteer army as &quot;the most lunatic approach&quot; to the strategic 
    threats facing the United States, and called for &quot;constructing a pyramid 
    of reserve capabilities, with the base of the pyramid provided by a national 
    organized militia grounded in universal military training.&quot; Citing the 
    experience of Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge in France during 1793-1804, 
    and of West Point under Commandant Sylvanus Thayer, he elaborated: &quot;Every 
    person not disqualified by physical or mental disabilities, should enter universal 
    military training at the age of eighteen, following some significant degree 
    of pretraining as part of secondary-school programs. Universal military training 
    should be based on a combination of university UMT programs plus two-year 
    engineering-academy training, including a twenty-five percent or greater military-training 
    component.... The national militia reserve is interchangeable with the reserve 
    forces of a national Corps of Engineers.&quot; He explained that, except for 
    the purely military aspects of the program, UMT should cost the nation nothing 
    in net, since it would provide enormous gains in productivity, relative to 
    the costs of the engineering training, by raising the skill levels of the 
    workforce.&quot; This concept has featured in LaRouche's work throughout the 
    intervening years.</p>
  <p>In an Oct. 22, 2003 webcast, from Washington, D.C., LaRouche announced: &quot;It 
    is also my present intention, that during the first hours of my Presidency, 
    I shall present a proposed bill to Congress restoring national military service 
    of qualified citizens. We may recall, that it was the lunatic folly of the 
    so-called preventive U.S. war in Indo-China which led to the destruction of 
    national military service of citizens. As we have seen lately, the reform 
    ending the draft did not solve the problem we experienced in Indo-China, but 
    actually made it worse, as we have seen the same great folly re-enacted in 
    Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
  <p>&quot;It has been largely forgotten that national military service was the 
    tradition upon which our constitutional republic was founded.&quot;</p>
  <p>Nation-Building/Army Corps of Engineers</p>
  <p>At his Oct. 22, 2003 webcast, LaRouche stressed: &quot;Despite our healthy 
    abhorrence of war, national military service is an integral part of citizenship 
    in a functionally sound republic. The urgent need for building up the Army 
    Corps of Engineers at this time is a relevant example.</p>
  <p>&quot;We have a social problem of first magnitude of importance among the 
    generations of young Americans who have little or no qualification for the 
    kind of productive employment in which they could expect to support a normal 
    family household. In Franklin Roosevelt's time, we attacked this kind of problem 
    with the quasi-militarized Civilian Conservation Corps. On my first day in 
    office, I shall take a series of related actions on this problem.</p>
  <p>&quot;The fundamental solution for the present bankruptcy of our nation, 
    lies in halting the cutting of general levels of good-producing employment 
    in the misused name of balancing budgets, and, instead, expanding the level 
    of total productive employment, up to the point that the value of the goods 
    produced exceeds the costs and expenses currently incurred for the operation 
    of the national economy. We must bring the level of productive employment 
    up, such that current output exceeds the current component of costs of maintaining 
    the nation. The measures we must take immediately to bring this problem under 
    control, must include measures which remedy the lack of competence for good 
    productive employment among a very large ration of young Americans.</p>
  <p>&quot;Our experience with World War II war-time selective service, when combined 
    with the experience of the CCCs, shows us the road to transforming presently 
    marginally-employable young Americans into a quality of employable labor force 
    needed for a successful national economy recovery effort overall. Since more 
    than half of the economic recovery effort needed today will be in basic economic 
    infrastructure at the Federal, state, and county/municipa1 level, the combined 
    role of an Army Corps of Engineers with auxiliaries resembling the CCCs is 
    an obvious leading element of the national economic-recovery process.</p>
  <p>&quot;These forces, both military and civilian, shall function under a principle 
    of mission-orientation. The orientation will proceed from the role to be accomplished 
    for the nation and its economy as a whole, by the infrastructure-building 
    program as a whole; and from the integral importance of the function of the 
    particular project to which they are currently assigned. We must shift the 
    idea of labor, back to the personal satisfaction of the worker in getting 
    the job well done which is needed for the nation.&quot;</p>
  <p>Iraq Policy. A Nov. 24, 2003 press release from the LaRouche in 2004 campaign 
    is headlined, &quot;LaRouche: 'I'm for the Immediate Withdrawal of U.S. Forces 
    From Iraq.' &quot; He emphasized that &quot;U.S. troops in Iraq are now absolutely 
    useless, because of the crimes that have been committed by our government. 
    We have lost all credibility in the situation. So I wouldn't want a single 
    American in that area, at this time.&quot; He proposed that, through the United 
    Nations Security Council, we establish the arrangements under which Iraq could 
    be rebuilt as a nation.</p>
  <p>&quot;My withdrawal plan is very simple: can we get them all out overnight? 
    Physically? No. You have to move them. How do you move them? What you do is, 
    your policy says you're going to withdraw your troops into certain areas of 
    concentration for withdrawal. So you pick these territories, and your little 
    hedgehogs, and you begin to fly the troops out. And the other forces or whoever 
    comes in to assist the Iraqis, will replace them. So, effectively, on the 
    day the orders are given, they will be effectively on the way out. The order 
    will be believed, and it will be as rapidly as possible. They will withdraw 
    to positions which are predetermined as places of concentration. And they 
    will be removed, as units. And the other nations will take over responsibility.&quot;</p>
  <p>Veterans</p>
  <p>At his Oct. 22, 2003 webcast, from Washington, D.C., titled, &quot;Preparing 
    for the Post-Cheney Era,&quot; LaRouche prioritized military policy under 
    the topic, &quot;Honor the Veteran.&quot; He began his discussion of this, 
    saying, &quot;It is also my present intention, that during the first hours 
    of my Presidency, I shall present a proposed bill to Congress restoring national 
    military service of qualified citizens....&quot; The principle involved in 
    this, and the related points he then made about building up the Army Corps 
    of Engineers, and other measures, all serve the purpose of restoring the economy 
    of the United States.</p>
  <p>In early January 2004, LaRouche commissioned work for a mass-circulation 
    policy document on the economic crisis, and the crisis of military personnel&#151;active 
    duty, reserves, and veterans, saying, &quot;The time has come to end the turning 
    of our military into unpaid mercenaries.&quot;</p>
  <p>During his campaign, LaRouche has stressed the measures necessary to assure 
    a sound economy, with an adequate infrastructure base (hospitals, medical 
    corps) and institutions (Veterans Administration system, pensions) in order 
    to provide for the livelihoods of veterans and civilians alike&#151;jobs, 
    housing, medical care. Among the points he specified on Oct. 22, for example, 
    was health care. He said, &quot;I shall also take immediate action, within 
    the power of the Executive, and by proposed legislation to the Congress, to 
    fully reactivate the Veterans Hospital System.&quot;</p>
  <p>For health care, LaRouche has repeatedly focussed on the need to restore 
    a full-service system of VA facilities, and to stop the shutdown and denial 
    of health care. He calls for repeal of the HMO system, and all the various 
    forms of &quot;managed care&quot; being promoted in the military. He calls 
    for a return to the principles of the post-World War II Hill-Burton Act, to 
    provide adequate medical facilities for all (referring to the 1946 bipartisan 
    national hospital-building program).</p>
  <p>On Oct. 28, 2001, at the time of the anthrax attacks, LaRouche issued a document, 
    &quot;Building a National Defense Against Germ Warfare,&quot; which called 
    for building up public health and hospital capabilities, on the basis of military 
    principles of logistics in depth. This has been a theme for decades. In 1983, 
    in a 15-page paper on the SDI, LaRouche wrote a detailed profile of the principles 
    involved, under the heading of &quot;Tasks of Civil Defense,&quot; stressing, 
    &quot;a practicable civilian defense medical assistance system will be one 
    modeled on military medical organizations.&quot; (Fusion, September-October 
    1983)</p>
  <p>Earlier in 2001, LaRouche waged an international effort to prevent the shutdown 
    of D.C. General Hospital in Washington, and his campaign pointed out the disastrous 
    process of destruction of both the military and community facilities across 
    the nation. Significant health-care infrastructure was lost when 100 bases 
    in 28 states were closed under the Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1988 
    and 1990; then even more, over the past decade. In Washington, D.C. the Walter 
    Reed Army Medical Center was designed to treat 1,260 patients. As of 2000, 
    it had eliminated all but 240 beds.</p>
  <p>In another issue of urgent concern to veterans, LaRouche's campaign committee 
    on Sept. 15, 2003 put out a press release stating that when he enters the 
    White House in January 2005, &quot;he will launch a full probe into the circumstances 
    surrounding the sinking of the U.S.S. Liberty, during the June 1967 Arab-Israeli 
    War. He added that he would call on President Bush and on all other candidates 
    in the 2004 Presidential race to join him in endorsing such an official probe, 
    so that there would be no need to wait for 16 months to get the investigation 
    moving&#151;while many key witnesses are still alive and able to provide their 
    eyewitness evidence.&quot;</p>
  <p>John Kerry<br>
    Military Doctrine/Strategic Defense <i>(A double-minded man is unstable in 
    all his ways).</i></p>
  <p>Senator Kerry most often addresses defense in terms of how to deal with the 
    threats of &quot;global terrorism,&quot; and in particular, he stresses using 
    diplomacy, not resorting to warfare. In 1997, Kerry wrote The New War, described 
    on his campaign website as, &quot;an in-depth assessment of the national security 
    issues facing the United States in the 21st century.&quot;</p>
  <p>In a speech on Dec. 16, 2003 in Des Moines, Iowa, titled, &quot;Foreign Policy 
    in a Post-Saddam World: Rebuilding Our Alliances and Iraq,&quot; Kerry stated 
    some general points on defense, without addressing military strategy as such. 
    He said: &quot;I believed then [a year and a half ago], and I believe now, 
    that Americans deserve better than a false choice between force without diplomacy, 
    and diplomacy without force. To provide responsible leadership, we need to 
    take the third path in foreign policy&#151;a bold, progressive internationalism&#151;backed 
    by undoubted military might&#151;that commits America to lead in the cause 
    of human liberty and prosperity....</p>
  <p>&quot;Nowhere it that clearer than in Iraq.... The Administration's reluctance 
    to share power and responsibility is all the more stunning because it prevents 
    them from investing Europe and Middle Eastern neighbors in their own self-interest 
    not to have a failed state on their doorsteps and borders....</p>
  <p>&quot;The threat of terror continues to reach from the streets of Baghdad 
    and the Middle East to the streets of Asia, Europe, and America itself. We 
    must not waste this opportunity to rebuild alliances, both in Iraq and against 
    global terrorism. &quot;We owe this kind of internationalism first of all 
    to our troops.... We need tools of diplomacy equal to the tools of war&quot; 
    (emphasis in the original).</p>
  <p>On Sept. 25, 2003, in an interview on CNN with Paula Zahn, he said that Defense 
    Secretary Rumsfeld should resign over his failed Iraq policy. Kerry accused 
    him of rushing to war without adequate planning. &quot;Our military is weaker 
    today; they're overextended.&quot;</p>
  <p>The future of the U.S. military is referenced on Kerry's website, in an undated 
    item titled, &quot;Priorities&#151;Giving Our Military the Tools and Support 
    It Needs.&quot; Kerry says: &quot;It is up to Democrats to understand and 
    prepare for the Fourth Generation Warfare&#151;fighting unconventional forces 
    in unconventional ways&#151;so our nation can be better prepared to wage and 
    win the new war.... A modern military means smarter, more versatile equipment; 
    better intelligence; advanced communications; long-range air power; and highly 
    mobile ground forces.&quot;</p>
  <p>He also calls for supporting members of the armed forces with &quot;quality 
    health care, housing, and competitive wages,&quot; and similar measures. He 
    was co-sponsor of an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization 
    Bill to allow the military to transport family members of those service people 
    wounded in active duty.</p>
  <p>Preventive War</p>
  <p>On June 17, 2003, in an interview for MoveOn.org, Kerry was asked whether 
    he would repeal Bush's pre-emptive war doctrine, and replied, &quot;I spoke 
    out against it during the Senate's Iraq debate, stating that we should not 
    be 'giving Bush carte blanche to run roughshod over every country that poses&#151;or 
    may pose&#151;a potential threat to the U.S.' Bush's position is a blanket 
    doctrine that can easily be misinterpreted and misapplied. As President, I 
    will use force when it is necessary to defend core American values and interests 
    against imminent threats.&quot;</p>
  <p>In October 2002, Kerry voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military 
    Force Against Iraq Resolution.</p>
  <p>Mini-Nukes</p>
  <p>Kerry uses the formulation, &quot;Fourth Generation&quot; warfare, to refer 
    to &quot;unconventional&quot; combat with unconventional weapons, but, on 
    his website, he does not differentiate, nor denounce those in the Administration 
    today, who seek mini-nuclear weapons and pretexts for war.</p>
  <p>He supports more international weapons control, stating, &quot;It is time 
    for the most determined, all-out effort ever initiated to secure the world's 
    nuclear materials and weapons of mass destruction.&quot; He fought against 
    U.S. withdrawal from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</p>
  <p>Universal Service</p>
  <p>On Oct. 16, 2003, in Franklin, New Hampshire, a voter asked Kerry if he would 
    re-institute the draft, in order to make the burden of military service equal, 
    because, &quot;the poor people fight the war, while the rich people stand 
    by.&quot; According to the Union Leader coverage, &quot;Kerry said he wouldn't 
    bring back the draft to deal with the situation in Iraq, and would consider 
    it only in a situation where there was a much larger war. He said, if the 
    draft were re-instituted, he would want to see it administered 'without politics 
    and favoritism.' &quot; On Dec. 2, 2003, at a speech at Boston University, 
    Kerry said he does not believe there is a need to re-instate the draft, which 
    Kerry described as a source of conflict during the Vietnam War.</p>
  <p>Nation-Building/Army Corps of Engineers</p>
  <p>Kerry's website has no reference to the U.S. military tradition and role 
    of engineering for infrastructure provision for nation-building. On May 19, 
    2003, he called for creation of &quot;A New Army of Patriots&quot; for &quot;a 
    nationwide commitment to national service&quot; for civilians. Functions cited 
    include firefighting, police-work, and other functions, some potentially connected 
    to security of infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Iraq Policy</p>
  <p>In his Dec. 16, 2003 speech, Kerry outlined four main points on Iraq: 1) 
    give the UN authority in the rebuilding process, and development of a new 
    Iraqi constitution and government. &quot;Ambassador Bremer and the coalition 
    Provisional Authority should be sincerely thanked for their service&#151;and 
    replaced by a UN Special Representative in Iraq who will remove the stigma 
    of foreign occupation from our presence there.&quot; 2) Increase the size 
    of the U.S. force in Iraq. &quot;In the face of grave challenges, our armed 
    forces are spread too thin.&quot; 3) Set a timetable for transferring political 
    power and responsibility for reconstruction, over to the people of Iraq; and 
    also, arrange for a trial for Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in which international 
    participants (jurists, prosecutors, and investigators) work alongside Iraqis. 
    4) Restore &quot;a sense of basic order&quot; in Iraq. Lawlessness undermines 
    civil society. For order, &quot;The job properly belongs to the new Iraqi 
    security forces. And the United States and the allies we enlist need to do 
    a far better job of training them&#151;and then transferring authority to 
    then.&quot;</p>
  <p>Veterans</p>
  <p>Kerry lists nine priorities: 1) mandatory funding of veterans' health care; 
    2) granting full concurrent receipt to disabled veterans (to receive both 
    military retirement pay and disability compensation); 3) making the Veterans 
    Administration responsive; 4) proper financial compensation for soldiers and 
    their families; 5) full accounting for POW/MIAs; 6) combating homelessness; 
    7) supporting members of the National Guard and Reservists; 8) protecting 
    family members who lose a loved one; 9) not overstretching the military. For 
    the last point, Kerry calls for a temporary increase of about 40,000 active-duty 
    Army troops, to last out the remainder of this decade.<br>

  ARE CHENEY AND FRIENDS USING DROSNIN'S BIBLE CODE?<br>
  From Godlike Productions list<br>
  5-1-04 </p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Hello GPLers, <br>
  I would appreciate any links you can find relating to the story about Michael 
  Drosnin, author of The Bible Code, who has apparently been holding back some 
  of his predictions exclusively to counsel Dick Cheney and other high-ranking 
  members of the national Security State elite as to the events of May 15-20. 
  Drosnin was consulted by the Pentagon prior to the Iraq invasion and more recently 
  by Cheney who has allegedly paid him a consultant retainer. The controversial 
  author was probed on his view of the David Booth's prophecy that America would 
  be destroyed at some point during the month of May 2004, as elucidated in his 
  work of plagiarism &quot;Code Red: The Coming Destruction of America.&quot; 
  <br>
</p>
<p align="left">(Note - Mr. Booth mentioned the time frame of 'April 20 - May 
  20' as the time during which something would happen that would 'change the world 
  forever'. You can hear him so state in our program Archives in his 'final interview' 
  of April 12. -ed) Drosnin's advice has reportedly seen Cheney in a whirl of 
  self-preservational activity recently, engaged in enhancing his underground 
  facilities at the Naval Observatory and at Greenbriars in West Virginia. http://www.godlikeproductions.com.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">The following confirmation of the Drosnin briefings appeared in 
  the NY Times on March 8, 2003 in an article written by Bill Keller. -ed <br>
</p>
<p align="left">Excerpt: <br>
  Two weeks ago, a group of senior intelligence officials in the Defense Department 
  sat for an hour listening to a briefing by a writer who claims &quot; I am not 
  making this up &quot; that messages encoded in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament 
  provide clues to the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. One of the officials told 
  me that they had agreed to meet the writer, Michael Drosnin, author of a Nostradamus-style 
  best seller, without understanding that he was promoting Biblical prophecy. 
  Still, rather than shoo him away, they listened politely as he consumed several 
  man-hours of valuable intelligence-crunching time. Apparently he has given similar 
  briefings to top officials of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. <br>

  The Bible Code? By Linn Ciesla Rumor Mill News Agents Forum 4-4-3 <br>

<p align="left">Have you ever noticed the way any sort of predictive art/science 
  is consistently ridiculed by the mainstream, but meanwhile seem to be used on 
  an invariably consistent level by those in power? A long time ago, J.P. Morgan 
  said, &quot;Millionaires don't use Astrologers, billionaires do.&quot; And, 
  we've all heard about Nancy Reagan's penchant for astrologers, you can read

  that here: http://www.astrologynow.com/Astrology.601.htm <br>
  Currently, the latest thing our leadership seems to be dabbling in is Bible

  9A6AF5F- A64C-4031-AF96-C478FFBDD643 Here's an excerpt: <br>
</p>
<p align="left">On the eve of war, the military brass listened intently for a 
  full hour as Michael Drosnin expounded on his two brisk-selling volumes on the 
  Bible code. Drosnin argues the Hebrew Torah -- the first five books of the Old 
  Testament -- were intentionally encrypted, by a higher power, with prophetic 
  warnings that have accurately predicted the Great Depression, the Second World 
  War, the Kennedy assassinations, the moon landing, Watergate, and 9/11 -- and 
  foretell the fall of Saddam Hussein and the precise location of bin Laden. The 
  Americans &quot;took it very seriously,&quot; Drosnin says. &quot;They're practical 
  people and I wanted to give them something of practical use.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p align="left">As a result of the meeting, Drosnin says U.S. and Israeli intelligence 
  forces are hot on bin Laden's trail in that very place the Bible mentions, &quot;right 
  as we speak.&quot; Of course, he would not divulge where that place is. As for 
  Saddam Hussein, the Bible's embedded code ponders, &quot;Who is destroyed?&quot; 
  and then, in the same matrix, answers, &quot;Hussein,&quot; with the following 
  number crossing his name: 5763, the Jewish year that corresponds to 2003. &quot;That 
  foretells the outcome of this conflict,&quot; Drosnin says confidently. &quot;It 
  might be obvious now, but it wasn't when I told them.&quot; If you're really 
  interested in all this, you also might want to take a look at 'Isaac Newton, 
  Bible Code Pioneer?': http://www.biblecodedigest.com/page.php/74 <br>
</p>
<p align="left">To Newton,s mind it was clear that some prophecies would not be 
  understood until the end of history. This is an excerpt from his book on Daniel 
  and Revelation: This prophecy is called the Revelation, with respect to the 
  Scripture of Truth, which Daniel was commanded to shut up and seal, till the 
  time of the end. Daniel sealed it until the time of the end, and until that 
  time comes, the Lamb is opening the seals: and afterward the two Witnesses prophesy 
  out of it a long time in sackcloth, before they ascend up to heaven in a cloud. 
  All of which is as much as to say, that the prophecies of Daniel and John should 
  not be understood till the time of the end: but that some should prophesy out 
  of it in an afflicted and mournful state for a long time, and that but darkly, 
  so as to convert but few. But in the very end, the Prophecy should be so far 
  interpreted so as to convince many. Then saith Daniel, many shall run to and 
  fro, and knowledge shall be increased. For the Gospel must first be preached 
  in all nations before the great tribulation, and end of the world. The palm-bearing 
  multitude, which came out of this great tribulation, cannot be innumerable out 
  of all nations unless they be made so by the preaching of the Gospel before 
  it comes. There must be a stone cut of the mountain without hands, before it 
  can fall on the toes of the Image, and become a great mountain and fill the 
  earth. An Angel must fly through the midst of heaven with the everlasting Gospel 
  to preach to all nations, before Babylon falls, and the Son of man reaps his 
  harvest. The two prophets must ascend up to heaven in a cloud, before the kingdoms 
  of this world become the kingdoms of Christ. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">'Tis therefore a part of this Prophecy, that it should not be 
  understood before the last age of the world; and therefore it makes for the 
  credit of the Prophecy, that it is not yet understood. But if the last age, 
  the age of opening these things, be now approaching, as by the great success 
  of late Interpreters it seems to be, we have more encouragement than ever to 
  look into these things. <br>
  If the general preaching of the Gospel be approaching, it is for us and our 
  posterity that these words mainly belong: In the time of the end the wise shall 
  understand, but none of the wicked shall understand. Blessed is he that readeth, 
  and they that hear the words of this Prophecy, and keep those things that are 
  written therein (Daniel 12:4,10) </p>
<p align="left">I dunno -- guess astrology and bible codes are bullsh*t when us 
  regular folks use them, but worth spending taxpayer dollars on if the big shots 
  think they might give them an edge somehow? http://www.rense.com/general36/penta.htm
