  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Joel(ish) Teitelbaum of Satmar 
    (1888-1979), son of Hananiah Yom Tov Lipa Teitelbaum, served in communities 
    in the Carpathians and Northern Transylvania, and from 1928 at Satmar (Satu 
    Mare). He became involved there in fierce controversies with both Zionist 
    circles and Hasidim attached to other <i>zaddikim</i>, who violently opposed 
    him. During the holocaust in 1944, he was saved in the rescue train arranged 
    through R. R. Kasztner and from Bergen-Belsen reached Erez Israel. (see Jeremiah, 
    chapters 42 and 43). In 1947 he settled in the Williamsburg quarter of Brooklyn, 
    New York, which was the center of a hasidic congregation that continued the 
    way of life of a hasidic town in Hungary. In 1953 Teitelbaum became rabbi 
    of the ultra-Orthodox Neturei Karta community in Jerusalem, although he remained 
    in New York and only visited Israel every few years. Later his ties with the 
    community weakened and it ceased to regard him as rabbi.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Teitelbaum continued to be one 
    of the most vigorous opponents of Zionism and the State of Israel, and engaged 
    in intensive activity against the latter both in Israel and abroad, in his 
    writings and sermons, and by demonstrations. While his opposition to Zionism 
    and the State of Israel was based on halakhic grounds, most of which had been 
    raised from the beginning of the Zionist movement, he added objections to 
    the way of life and the social and political order in Israel, which in his 
    opinion contradict the principles of <i>halakhah. </i>According to Teitelbaum, 
    Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel constitutes a violation 
    of the three oaths which the people of Israel was made to swear (see Ket.3). 
    This has delayed the coming of Messiah and complete redemption, and resulted 
    in all the troubles affecting the Jewish people in the 20th century. The Holocaust 
    also was a punishment for the sins of Zionism and the State of Israel. Hence 
    Teitelbaum denounced the secular character of the state, objecting to its 
    democratic regime and legislature as not being founded on <i>halakhah.</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Teitelbaum also opposed the use 
    of Hebrew as the spoken language, since this has secularized the holy tongue, 
    and the adoption of the Sephardi pronunciation instead of the Ashkenazi. However 
    Teitelbaum did not express opposition to settlement in Israel provided that 
    it was not through a mass <i>aliyah</i> movement but carried out by individuals 
    only, from this point of view Erez Israel being no worse than other countries...Teitelbaum 
    forbade the Hasidim living in his community to cooperate with state institutions, 
    while ordering those living in Israel not to take the oath of loyalty to the 
    state, not to take part in the elections to its parliamentary institutions, 
    and not to make use of its law courts or legal system. </font></p>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Great Leaders of our People</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rav Yoel Teitelbaum 
    - The Satmarer Rebbe<br>
    (1887 &#150; 1979)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum began his 
    rabbinic career in Krooly, a small town in Hungary. In 1929, the Rav of the 
    Orthodox community in Satmar, a larger and more prestigious community, passed 
    away, and Rabbi Teitelbaum was invited for a Shabbos &#147;tryout.&#148; The 
    Rav displayed exceptional knowledge of Talmud, far above the prevailing image 
    of a Chassidic rabbi, who was expected to be more of an expert in Kabbalah 
    and prayer. He was retained by the community, which prospered under his leadership, 
    and began attracting students to its yeshiva from all over Hungary.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the War approached, the Satmarer 
    Rav was smuggled out of harm&#146;s way, first into Switzerland, where he 
    remained throughout the War, and afterwards in 1946, into Israel. On a fund-raising 
    mission to the United States, he met many people from his former community 
    who urged him to stay in America and help them recover from the trauma of 
    the War. Rabbi Teitelbaum&#146;s decision to stay in America was historic, 
    in that it set in place the foundation for the growth of the Satmar community. 
    After only a short time, the transplanted &#147;Yetiv Lev&#148; Congregation 
    emerged upon American soil, with Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum at the helm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1948, he drew worldwide attention 
    when he became the only Jewish leader to denounce the newly founded Jewish 
    state. He based his anti-Zionist position on a gemara in Kesuvos 111a, that 
    derives from the triple mention in Shir HaShirim of the verse, &#147;I have 
    bound you in oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,&#148; that HaShem bound the Jewish 
    People and the nations of the world with three oaths:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. &#147;shelo yaalu bachoma&#148; 
    &#150; that the Jews should not forcibly &#147;breach the wall,&#148; and 
    enter Eretz Yisrael<br>
    2. that the Jews should not rebel against the nations of the world<br>
    3. that the nations of the world should not oppress the Jewish People excessively 
    during the Exile</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gemara concludes with the threat 
    that if the Jews would violate these oaths, HaShem would bring upon them great 
    harm and physical destruction. Rabbi Teitelbaum claimed that the Zionist movement 
    had brought the Holocaust upon the Jewish People by violating the oaths incumbent 
    upon them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Two of the arguments raised against 
    the above are that by the Balfour Declaration the nations of the world gave 
    permission to the Jews to return to Israel. Another is that the oaths would 
    apply to the Jewish People only if the nations of the world did not excessively 
    mistreat them during the Galut. Centuries of massacre and pogrom certainly 
    testify otherwise as to the behavior of the nations of the world. If the nations 
    have violated their oath, the oaths upon the Jewish People are null and void.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 1950&#146;s, the Satmar 
    community continued to blossom. Williamsburg became the scene of many inspiring 
    Chassidic gatherings and public tefilos, such as would occur annually on Hoshanah 
    Rabbah, when the Satmar synagogue was a sea of lulavim and esrogim.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the 1960&#146;s, the Satmar 
    community in Brooklyn had grown rapidly and the rebbe had gained many new 
    adherents from immigration to the United States, and his opinions and blessings 
    were sought by thousands.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 1970&#146;s, the rebbe bought 
    land in Monroe, NY, and founded Kiryas Yoel, where a large branch of the Satmar 
    community now lives.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tens of thousands of his Chassidim 
    attended his funeral in Kiryat Yoel. None of his children survived him, as 
    all three of his daughters passed away during his lifetime. The Satmar community 
    grieved at the tremendous loss of their rebbe, who had led his followers according 
    to uncompromising principles, in which he deeply believed.</font></p>

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1">JERUSALEM...As they stood in the square awaiting the arrival 
    of their spiritual leader, several thousand people took up their movement's 
    chant: &quot;We do not recognize the rule of the infidels. We do not accept 
    their laws.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Those who took up the chant were not Arab Islamic fundamentalists. 
    They were ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jews, members of the Brooklyn-based Satmar 
    movement.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The spiritual leader they were waiting for was Rabbi Moishe 
    Teitelbaum, <font size="3">(the nephew of the deceased Yoel Teitelbaum)</font>, 
    the most outspoken foe of Israel in the Jewish world, currently on a two-week 
    visit to the state whose very existence he opposes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In the Satmar world-view, Israel was born in sin because 
    it was established by secular Jews who were not willing to wait for the Messiah 
    to come and establish the state for them.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">It is the lingering echo of an ideological struggle that 
    raged before World War II in the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe, including 
    the Hungarian-Romanian community of Satmar.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">For most the struggle ended with the war and the Holocaust, 
    in which 6 million Jews were murdered. In 1948 the overwhelming majority of 
    Jews, whatever their religious persuation, enthusiastically supported the 
    establishment of Israel. But not the Satmar Hasidim. <font size="3">(see Romans 
    11:4,5)</font>...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Satmar's views are not shared by other Hasidic groups. Many 
    like the Lubavitches, are strongly pro-Israel...</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Most Israelis are simply ignoring the rabbi's visit, or look 
    upon it with a kind of amused indifference. There have been no anti-Satmar 
    demonstrations, not even much editorial comment in the nation's newspapers.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">&quot;These people are a kind of folkloristic curio,&quot; 
    said Ma'ariv editorial writer Yosef Lapid. &quot;By choosing to oppose the 
    most important achievement in modern Jewish history, they have made themselves 
    irrelevant.&quot; <font size="3">The New York Daily News, by Andrew Meisels</font>.

  American Hasidic Community, </i>by George Kranzler:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ESSENTIALS OF 
        THE SATMAR IDEOLOGY</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Some people unfamiliar with 
    the underlying ideology of Williamsburg and Boro Park have called these large 
    American hasidic communities reconstructions of the Eastern European 'shtetl' 
    that are bound to vanish with the last survivors of their first and second-generation 
    immigrants.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Superficially, this might seem 
    true, because the Satmar Rebbe and others like him insisted on maintaining 
    the traditional East European garb and similar external trappings of a lifestyle 
    antipathetic to the American environment. (see Daniel 3:19-25). Yet a more 
    profound analysis will show that what the Satmar Rebbe built in Williamsburg, 
    Kiryas Joel, Bnei Brak and other centers of Orthodox Jewish life, is something 
    revolutionary and new. It represents his indomitable will to create a total 
    physical, social, and intellectual milieu that preserves its independence 
    and otherness within the very realities of life in the twentieth century.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IT IS THE METAHISTORICAL EXISTENCE 
    OF THE HERE-AND-NOW LIFESTYLE THAT PRESERVES THE ETERNAL TORAH VALUES while 
    interacting with the non-Jewish environment in a competent and meaningful 
    way...In the ideology of the Satmar Rebbe, spelled out in the elaborate essays 
    of 'Vayoel Mosheh,' these are new, INTRINSICALLY AMERICAN FORMS OF THE MOVABLE 
    'MISHKAN' (the Sanctuary) AND THE 'MAHANEH YISRAEL' (the Camp of Israel). 
    Their essential function is to preserve the sanctity of the Jewish individual 
    family, and community in any 'midbar' (figurative wilderness) anywhere in 
    the world. The eternal 'Am Yisrael' is guided by the web of divine commandments 
    and guidelines. These apply equally in Williamsburg, Monsey, Eretz Yisrael, 
    or anywhere else at any time in history until the Divine Will decides that 
    the people of Israel are worthy of the ULTIMATE REDEMPTION. (see Jeremiah 
    30:7-9).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The essential makeup of the 'Mananeh 
    Yisrael' is not variable by time and place or subject to the vagaries of historical, 
    political, social, or economic circumstances and situations. Each country 
    and culture in which Divine Providence has caused the Jewish people to set 
    up their 'tents' on their passage through 2,000 years of exile presents a 
    different challenge and a new chance to rise up to higher levels. This is 
    the sole reason and criterion of the Jewish community in the United States 
    or Eretz Yisrael of today, just as it was in the 'shtetl' of Poland, Hungary, 
    or Russia, and just as it was in the medieval or ancient communities of the 
    Near East and Central, Western, and Eastern Europe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If language or garments, such as 
    Yiddish or the hasidic garb, historically served to provide barriers against 
    assimilation, they have acquired a measure of sanctity and are therefore cultivated 
    for their own sake, regardless of their historic origin and of the change 
    in the settings in which they emerged...Against the warp and woof of this 
    thoroughly consistent Torah ideology, one must view the achievements of the 
    Satmar Rebbe...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His uncompromising stance, regardless 
    of its unpopularity, was rooted in his belief in the guidance of Divine Providence 
    in all the affairs of the collective as well as the individual life, at any 
    time and anywhere in 'Galut,' now, as in the past and in the future. If it 
    were the Divine Will to prolong the 'Galut' until the coming of 'Moshiah,' 
    the Ultimate Redemption, then no secular or religious movement had the right 
    to intervene or act counter to this basic direction, as pronounced by the 
    prophets since the beginning of the exile. Hence the secular State of Israel, 
    established by secular non-Jewish and Jewish authorities, had no place in 
    the ideology and practical realities of the Satmar Rebbe's world.&quot; </font>Hasidic

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Words of Rabbi Yoel 
    Teitelbaum against Zionist Heresy</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The words of the saintly Rabbi 
    Joel Teitelbaum, author of the VAYOEL MOSHE (in Hebrew, written in 1958) ring 
    clearly when we view events in the Middle East:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;...if we place all the immodesty 
    and promiscuity of the generation and the many sins of the world on one side 
    of the scale, and the Zionist state on the other side of the scale by itself, 
    it would outweigh them all. Zionism is the greatest form of spiritual impurity 
    in the entire world. They are polluting the entire world. They have polluted 
    the Jewish people with their heresy, Heaven help us. It is no surprise why 
    G-d's anger comes down from heaven. It is necessary to repent and escape from 
    them more than from a lion who is chasing a person to kill him.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It has been explained that 
    before the coming of the Messiah this regime will come to an end, as Messiah 
    cannot come any other way, since the Zionist state holds up the redemption 
    of the world. We need G-d's mercies that divine intervention should bring 
    about the end of the state. May G-d have mercy on us all.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">RABBI TEITELBAUM ALSO WROTE:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is clear that anyone who 
    believes in G-d has no doubt that they are from the source of the accursed 
    impurity of heresy, Heaven help us. It is horrible that such a thing arose 
    in our day, and how can we be silent when we see such violations of our faith 
    and the principles of our entire Torah? Especially since so many of our religious 
    brethren fail to speak out about the truth! In such circumstances, the entire 
    truth could be forgotten, G-d forbid.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Everything our blessed rabbis 
    cried out about earlier in the century about the dangers of Zionism has almost 
    been forgotten! Even my own writings go ignored. THEREFORE, SHOULD THE TRUTH 
    AND FOUNDATIONS OF OUR RELIGION BE FORGOTTEN? It is impossible to describe 
    to what extent the world has become sunken in such a falsehood which is destroying 
    the entire Torah. Therefore we are obliged to cry out before anyone against 
    the deep impurity which has spread out in our generation. Let us hope there 
    are increasing numbers who open up their eyes and the teachings of our forefathers 
    should reach their ears to seek truth and faith. Without this, there is no 
    hope....&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following are 
    excerpted in the book Gachalei Esh, an anthology ofthe writings of Rabbi Yoel 
    Teitelbaum, of blessed memory in regards tothe Agudah movement, over three 
    decades ago.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    All sections of the Agudah go in one direction: To Zionism And even within 
    the party called Agudah there are a number of known groups, but they all lead 
    to the direction of Zionism, from whence is the well of evil and bitter waters 
    of sectarianism and heresy...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zionism with the Approval of the 
    &quot;Council of Torah Sages</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And now that the Agudah has joined 
    with the idolators, the idolators are even more arrogant since they see that 
    everyone is with them. This is because the Agudah operates with the approval 
    of the 'Council of Torah Sages' and the rabbis and rebbes and heads of yeshivas 
    make all their actions kosher.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Walking arm in arm</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone with a brain in his head 
    can see that in recent years the Agudah has joined the Zionists arm in arm, 
    but just with different faces.....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All their words (of the Agudah) 
    are empty air</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is impossible to go into all 
    their empty claims, lies, fantasies and falsifications on paper, since there 
    is no limit to their empty words and lies and phoney fantasies. But anyone 
    concerned with the word of G-d sees that all their words are vanity, and totally 
    lacking in content.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They serve the Zionist idolatry 
    with all their hearts</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Satan has succeeded in that even 
    some who are called religious have devoted themselves to serving the Zionists 
    with all their hearts, and help them to fulfill their aspirations to mislead 
    and deceive. They totally turn themselves over to idolatry. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They bring Zionism into Synagogues</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The religious Zionists bring the 
    rule of the Zionists into the synagogues, where they recite Hallel and Shehechayanu 
    and make fund raising appeals for all the organizations. They know themselves 
    that the money they are collecting, even on the Eve of Yom Kippur goes into 
    places of heresy and destruction of our religion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone helping the Zionists to 
    bring immigrants to the Holy Land, woe to them and their souls And all the 
    moreso when they come to Eretz Yisrael under the Zionists and fall into their 
    trap, and then pull out of them any faith and Torah. Woe to them and their 
    souls those aiding this and flattering the Zionists. Their sin is great, and 
    rises to heaven.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The claims of the Agudah that they 
    fight Zionism is ridiculous</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And how can they say that they 
    fight the Zionists and that their educational system is geared to implant 
    pure faith to fight heresy? Who would be foolish enough to believe that the 
    heretics would give money and weapons to enable others to fight against them? 
    Their whole purpose is to WEAKEN the struggle against them and to implant 
    heresy<br>
    into the educational system.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Joining the Agudah is dangerous 
    physically and spiritually</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For all those religious people 
    who gives the Zionists support, and have distorted the teachings of the Torah, 
    they shall be held responsible in the next world. One has to run away from 
    them and from joining them as far as is possible. Joining them is a great 
    physical and spiritual danger.</font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can anyone join the Agudah 
    who are one with the Zionists?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With regard to your question about 
    joining the Agudah, I am surprised at the question, since it is known that 
    they are one with the Zionists who have destroyed the world and dragged the 
    Jewish people into heresy. Whoever brings the people to join the heretics, 
    G-d forbid to join him or to listen to his instructions Whoever praises the 
    heretics and brings the masses over to the views of the heretics, G-d forbid 
    to join him or to listen to his instructions.</font></p>
