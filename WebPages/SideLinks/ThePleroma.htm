    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">CHRIST...or 
      the Higher Self, is the fundamental principle underlying the idea of personal 
      Godhood: and is the Divine Life which proceeds forth from the Absolute, 
      as the Son from the Father, to enter the world of manifestation and animate 
      all things. He it is who is the Divine Sacrifice, in that he limits himself 
      within all of his creatures. Again, when involution and evolution are accomplished, 
      </font><font size="+1">(see Ephesians 4:9,10)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">, 
      he leaves the world and departs to the Father, taking with him the results

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Now through 
      that Divine effort of manifestations, all that is expressed and comprised 
      in mineral, vegetal, animal, and human, is lived through in due order in 
      this underworld. whilst the essential Christ, the Lord in heaven, is &quot;seated 
      at the Right Hand of the Father&quot;: that is, he lives as the Power Actual 
      proceeding from Power Potential. He comes forth in the world-cycle as Saviour 
      and Judge in innumerable cloaks (forms) as the One Life operating diversely 
      in many sheaths.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Christ 
      is in everything. The forms or sheaths--the outward expressions of potential 
      Spirits--are as the borders of his garment, which he shall cast forth when 
      their purpose is effected, and afterwards he shall reveal his Full Form 
      and Stature to himself, for there is not another beside him. The All is 
      no other than the One. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

      is nothing which remains unchallenged, no doctrine, no discipline, no law, 
      no custom. What is demanded, as was demanded of Israel, is nothing less 
      than a death and resurrection. 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I 
      will raise it up'...But he spoke of the temple of his body.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It is 
      this Body of Christ which has to undergo this transformation, this temple 
      of the eternal Wisdom. From the beginning of the world this temple has been 
      building--the whole creation is the temple of God. From the beginning of 
      history this Body of Christ, which is the body of humanity, in which the 
      divine Spirit dwells, has been growing age by age. Every religion has contributed 
      to the building of this temple, every human being is a member of this Body, 
      which is the 'pleroma,' the 'fulness' of him who fills all in all. Now the 
      Church is this Body of Christ. It is the visible structure in which the 
      mystery of the divine life among men is being manifested. But it is not 
      possible to conceive this Church in isolation from the rest of the world. 
      This divine Mystery is present everywhere in the hearts of all men. It is 
      present in every religion. The mystery of the Church, which is the mystery 
      of the divine life among men, has to be seen in the light of the universal 
      revelation. It is not sufficient to return to the Bible to discover the 
      original source of Christianity. The biblical revelation has to be seen 
      in the context of history as a stage in the manifestation of the Word of 
      God, of the eternal Wisdom, which has been present in the world from the 
      beginning.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Return
