<p align="center"><font size="+2">A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE MUSLIM WORLD</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">By Oriana Fallaci</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The New York Observer, Jan.27, 2003__'&quot;Islam' 
  says Oriana Fallaci...'has never wanted to know about freedom and democracy 
  and progress. In short, has not changed.' She warns that 'from Afghanistan to 
  Sudan, from Palestine to Pakistan, from Malaysia to Iran, from Egypt to Iraq, 
  from Algeria to Senegal, from Syria to Kenya, from Libya to Chad, from Lebanon 
  to Morocco, from Indonesia to Yemen, from Saudi Arabia to Somalia, THE HATE 
  FOR THE WEST SWELLS LIKE A FIRE BEING FED BY THE WIND. And the followers of 
  Islamic Fundamentalism multiply like protozoa of a cell which splits to become 
  two cells, then four then eight then sixteen then thirty-two. To infinity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In France, a group called the Movement 
  Against Racism and the Friendship Between People tried to get her book banned. 
  A French court rejected the request. In Italy, a booklet titled </font><i><font size="+1">Islam 
  Punished Oriana Fallaci</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
  written by the president of the Italian Islamic Party, called for Muslims to 
  'go and die with Fallaci.' Ms. Fallaci sued the author for slander and instigation 
  to murder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'My life,' Ms. Fallaci wrote in her 
  book's Preface, 'is seriously in danger.'...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we drank wine in her sitting room, 
  surrounded by bookshelves...she talked about </font><i><font size="+1">The Rage 
  and the Pride's</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i> </i>success 
  in Europe. 'I have been months and months of best-seller No.1,' Ms Fallaci said 
  in her strong Florentine accent. 'I do not say this to make self-congratulations. 
  I say this to underline my thesis--THAT THE MOMENT WAS <i>MATURE</i>! THAT I 
  HAVE PUT THE FINGER ON THE <i>NERVE</i> OF SOMETHING: the Muslims immigration 
  which grows and grows without inserting itself in our way of life...And people 
  in Europe are so exasperated BY THE ARROGANCE of most of these <i>invaders</i> 
  and being blackmailed with the unfair term <i>racist</i> when they protest, 
  that there was a kind of thirst for a book like this...There is no other explanation 
  for the book's success! I have written better books than this. I have written 
  beautiful books over my life's work. This is a scream rather than an essay--a 
  book written in two weeks, c'mon. <i>Why? </i>It was not the book itself. It 
  was the thirst, the hunger.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'You know in the turning of history 
  there are, at times, a brusque turn,' she said. 'Consider all the steps of history. 
  I'M AFRAID THAT WE ARE NOW AT ONE OF THOSE TURNS. Not because we want it. BECAUSE 
  IT IS IMPOSED ON US. It is not this time a revolution, like the American Revolution 
  or the French Revolution...IT IS A COUNTERREVOLUTION! Alas. And it is against 
  us.'...'The West, is under assault and doesn't realize it...If we stay inert, 
  if we let ourselves be scared, then we become collaborationists,' she said. 
  'If we are passive...THEN WE LOSE THE WAR THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED AGAINST US.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'We can talk for centuries about 
  the word <i>racist,' </i>she said. '<i>Racist</i> has to do with race and not 
  with religion. YES, I AM AGAINST THAT RELIGION, A RELIGION THAT CONTROLS THE 
  LIFE OF PEOPLE IN EVERY MINUTE OF THEIR DAY, THAT PUTS THE <i>BURQA</i> ON WOMEN, 
  THAT TREATS WOMEN AS CAMELS, THAT PREACHES POLYGAMY, THAT CUTS THE HANDS OF 
  POOR THIEVES...I am not religious--all religions are difficult to accept for 
  me--but the Islamic one is not even a religion, in my opinion. IT IS A TYRANNY, 
  A DICTATORSHIP--THE ONLY RELIGION ON EARTH THAT HAS NEVER COMMITTED A WORK OF 
  SELF CRITICISM...IT IS IMMOVABLE. IT BECOMES WORSE AND WORSE...IT IS 1400 YEARS 
  AND THESE PEOPLE NEVER REVIEW THEMSELVES, AND NOW THEY WANT TO IMPOSE IT ON 
  ME, ON US?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Listen,' she said, wagging a finger. 
  'Those who do not follow what people like me say are unrealistic, are really 
  masochistic, BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THE REALITY...Muslims have PASSION, and 
  we have lost the passion. People like me who have passion are derided...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Americans,' she said, repeating 
  for me something she told the American Enterprise Institute, 'you have taught 
  me the stupid word: cool. <i>Cool, cool, cool</i>! Coolness, coolness, you've 
  got to be <i>cool</i>...When I speak like I speak now, with passion, you smile 
  and laugh at me! I've got passion. They've got passion. THEY HAVE SUCH PASSIONS, 
  AND SUCH GUTS, THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO DIE FOR IT.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I asked her about the death threats 
  she receives. 'You put your finger on the wound,' she said--but not because 
  she is afraid. 'I can't bear the bodyguards,' she explained. In Italy, she said, 
  'they are imposed on her...If anything happened to her in Italy it would be 
  a political scandal. However, in New York she's fairly vulnerable, and she likes 
  it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Thank God the Americans don't care 
  about me!' she said, adding that the FBI had been over a few times. 'I am not 
  saying this, because I want to look like I am Rambo, or that I don't care. That's 
  stupid,' she said. 'It's my temperament. When you have been born in a war like 
  me, living in a war as a child, when you have been in wars as a war correspondent 
  all your life--trust me! You develop a form of fatalism; you are always ready 
  to die. AND WHEN YOU LOVE YOUR OWN FREEDOM AS MUCH AS I DO, you don't bend to 
  the fear to be killed, because otherwise you do nothing--you go under the bed 
  and you stay hidden 24 hours.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'The point is not winning or losing,' 
  she said. 'Of course, I want to win. The point is to fight well with dignity. 
  The point is, if you die, to die ON YOUR FEET, STANDING UP.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How did she feel about President 
  Bush?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'We will see; it's too soon,' she 
  said. 'I have the impression that Bush has a certain vigor and also a dignity 
  which had been forgotten in the United States for eight years.' She doesn't 
  like it, however, when the President calls Islam a </font><i><font size="+1">Religion 
  of Peace</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...'But he doesn't 
  listen to me...'&quot;</font></p>
