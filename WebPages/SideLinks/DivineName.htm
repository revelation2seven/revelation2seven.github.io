  <b>WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT: SOMEBODY'S NAME OR THE ETERNAL TRUTH? <br>

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(We do not subscribe 
    here to every premise of John Kaminski, to every hint of Jewish conspiracy, 
    to those parts of this [or any other of his many discourses] that will prove 
    in the end to be zealously shortsighted and lacking understanding, but certainly 
    to those places where he is both direct and correct. It is as Paul wrote: 
    <i>We see in part and know in part, and when that which is perfect comes, 
    that which is in part will be done away</i>). </font></p>

  It's not the creed that's important, it's the integrity. It's not the name that 
  we give to the thing we worship, it's recognizing the essence of that thing 
  as the highest truth, the thing worth being worshipped, so that the name we 
  put on it doesn't really matter, as long as we recognize the thing for what 
  it is. </b></p>
<p><b> We're too caught up in names, in identity, in rituals, and holiness. Piety 
  makes me sick. Rituals bore me. What we're looking for is truth, and that can 
  come in many guises, be from many places, and certainly have an infinite number 
  of different names. Do you understand what I'm saying? Let me make it clearer....</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>LET THEM GROW TOGETHER UNTIL THE HARVEST...MATTHEW 13:35-43...(KJV)</b></p>
<p> <b>Those spiritual gangsters who were run out of Egypt all those years ago 
  have led us in the wrong direction. And they've been abetted by holy men of 
  all persuasions who have betrayed those who have sought sanctuary in them, solace 
  from them. The maintenance of their own churchly business has become more important 
  to them than the souls they're supposed to be putting at ease, to be trying 
  to save. It's a problem with every church, synagogue and mosque that ever existed. 
  Some of them lose their souls over it. </b><b>Spiritual gangsters, that's the 
  right name for them. They saw the people's need. And they took advantage of 
  it. We have to have that home to go to, that place of rest. If we don't have 
  it, we can't function. Sure, you can call it repression of fear of death. But 
  it's the human condition. We can't deal with it without some help. Otherwise, 
  we'll get sick, or worse, weird. And maybe that's what happened to them. It's 
  the story of the first holy man, and every single one since. </b></p>
<p><b>People need to have things explained. Why am I here? What is it all for? 
  And most importantly, where am I going? If it's not explained, and then tucked 
  safely away in your brain like some kind of paid fuel bill, you're going to 
  worry. And worry keeps you from seeing, from being able to do all those other 
  wonderful that makes life the joy it can be. But problems arise when you get 
  two different versions of the truth. It's the same truth. But it's two businessmen, 
  each describing it differently, each trying to survive, each trying to make 
  a profit (no, that's too harsh, at this level) ... each trying to make his creed 
  survive to serve the people it was intended to serve. And eventually going to 
  war over their two different versions of the same story. Really sick. It's the 
  story of the stupid human race. </b></p>
<p><b>Here in this Westernized world we live in, we all derive our spiritual heritage 
  from the same bunch of Old Testament hooligans who were thrown out of Egypt 
  for nasty, usurious practices that many of them still exhibit today. Then they 
  were kicked out of Babylon and set up shop near the Dead Sea. Put any kind of 
  name on them you want: thugs with yarmulkes or perverts with crosses, or perhaps 
  worst of all, smug businessmen with clerical collars telling you they can save 
  your soul when they're really thinking about building theme parks in South Carolina. 
  They've bet their eternal souls on their bank accounts, and made people believe 
  that the name was more important than the thing that the name was trying to 
  describe. And that's how we lost our way. Which leads us to the present day. 
  </b></p>
<p><b>These same certain thugs are acting like any holy men trying to set up an 
  advantage for themselves in order to gain more money to pile in their particular 
  houses of worship. And because they're so subtle, so intelligent, and so rich, 
  they've managed to create laws in a lot of places that forbid people from talking 
  about certain events of history. Without going into this particularly freighted 
  event, let's just examine what it means to prohibit people from talking about 
  certain events. I think they call it, in some European countries, &quot;profaning 
  the memory of the dead,&quot; and they're putting plenty of people in jail for 
  just bringing the subject up. </b></p>
<p><b> You'd think, in this supposedly enlightened day and age, that people were 
  intelligent enough and open-minded enough to talk about anything, discuss it 
  rationally, and then come to some sort of consensus about what was the objective 
  truth. But no. It hasn't turned out that way. The guys with the yarmulkes say 
  you can't talk about it, what we say is true, it may not be challenged, and 
  we'll put you in jail if you continue this conversation. </b></p>
<p><b> Well, you have to take it seriously, because there are people in jail because 
  of it. Just look at old Ernst Zundel, kidnapped out of his house in Tennessee 
  and now having spent a year in solitary confinement in Canada without any formal 
  charges, just because he feels the need to point out that those gas chambers 
  you can see on the Auschwitz tour weren't really there in that particular form 
  during World War II. They've been reconstructed, and some people quibble about 
  the reconstruction. But there's a law that you can't talk about, and he's in 
  jail. </b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Ezekiel 5 to 9</b></p>
<p> <b>It's a classic example of the maxim: it's not the creed, it's the integrity. 
  In this case, integrity is the big loser. Not to mention Freedom of Speech. 
  It's definitely a religious issue. But it has nothing to do with God. Only the 
  version (or perversion) of what one group of supposedly holy men wants to cram 
  down the throats of everybody else. </b></p>
<p><b>Now, remember that we have to be careful about who we're criticizing, because 
  all too often we'll discover we're only criticizing ourselves. Such is the case 
  with all this palaver about Jews. Sure, the behavior of Israelis &#151; calling 
  their neighbors vermin and trying to exterminate them as such &#151; brings 
  a lot of needless heat down upon themselves, as do their traditions of usurious 
  banking, constantly claiming they're discriminated against while they're the 
  richest ethnic group on the planet, and also their open sexuality (to put it 
  politely). This last talent causes problems but also makes a lot of money from 
  those who don't like talking about sex in public but sure do in private. </b></p>
<p><b>Considering from where the Jewish tradition derives, the very people who 
  criticize it most better take a lot harder look at where their own traditions 
  come from, and realize that the very basis of Christianity and Islam derive 
  from ideas and rules Jews invented. In fact, if you want to get a little paranoid 
  about it, you could wonder if the Jews didn't invent those two spiritual paths 
  in order to gain a little privacy for themselves. Or some other advantage, like 
  yoking people with moral restraints while keeping their own rules more flexible 
  in order to gain a couple of extra points on the rate, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

<p><b>Lately I was privileged to receive an interesting post from Rumor Mill News 
  titled &quot;SHOCK: SECRET IDENTITY OF ISRAEL'S YAWEH REVEALED!&quot; I had 
  this feeling I was reading &quot;Weekly World News&quot; in the 7th century 
  B.C. </b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p align="center"><b>See Chapter 10...Ephrain Goes Backward</b></p>
<p><b>The point the story tried to make was that if Israel tried to claim some 
  kind of divine right to that land it stole from the Palestinians, it better 
  take a harder look at its own actual history, and realize the basis for this 
  claim rests on extremely shaky ground. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Kaminski 
  is right on point here)</font><b>.</b></p>
<p><b> Recently, in speech to visiting Christian Zionists, Israeli Prime Minister 
  Ariel Sharon asserted, &quot;This land is ours... God gave us the title deeds...&quot; 
  However, recent scholarly research, including discoveries by an archaeological 
  team from the University of Tel Aviv, not only deconstruct the Biblical Old 
  Testament and Torah stories upon which this claim rests, but grant previously 
  unthinkable credence to an ancient historian's claim that the Israelites of 
  Exodus were actually the Hyksos, and therefore of Asiatic origin </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(and 
  then he, or rather history, loses it...unless by Hyksos we mean Indo-European)</font><b>.. 
  </b></p>
<p><b> So wrote a cryptic fellow who goes by the name of M-theory. Briefly told, 
  he wrote that the Israelites were never in Egypt and that the Jewish god YHWH 
  had a girlfriend </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(a girlfriend)?</font><b>, 
  the goddess Asherah. (Is there a law against saying this?)</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Revelation 10:7...(KJV)</b></p>
<p><b>As far as the modern day Israelis being descended from the Mongol hordes 
  from Asia, well, we already knew that, from Arthur Koestler's famous book &quot;The 
  Thirteenth Tribe&quot; which revealed that most of the present-day inhabitants 
  of Israel are really expatriate Russians, and not Semites (which means there's 
  nothing to be anti- about). Crooks are crooks regardless of their DNA. </b></p>
<p><b> Other nuggets from Mr. M-Theory include: </b></p>
<p> <b>&quot;ASHERAH (WHOSE NAME MEANS &quot;SHE WHO WALKS IN THE SEA&quot;) supposedly 
  consort of the supreme god El, was also referred to as Elath (the goddess). 
  According to the Ugarit tradition, whose clay tablets contain the earliest known 
  alphabet, she was consort of El </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(as 
  was Sarasvati the consort of Brahma, and therefore Sara the consort of Abram)</font><b>, 
  and mother of seventy gods </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(see 
  Exodus 1:5)</font><b>. She is also associated with Baal and is supposed to have 
  interceded to her husband, the supreme god, on Baal's behalf, for the building 
  of a palace in order to grant him equal status with other gods. In the cuniform 
  tablets of Ras Shamrah (Circa 1400 BCE) the head of the Pantheon was El; his 
  wife was Asherat-of-the-sea (Asherah). After El, the greatest god was Baal, 
  son of El and Asherah. Curiously, Baal's consort is his mother, Asherah. In 
  the Lebanon traditions Baal is equated with Jupiter.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(or 
  Thor)</font><b>.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>The Cursed Hesus of the Druids...(Deuteronomy 21:22,23; 1 
  Corinthians 1:18-31). </b></p>
<p><b>Yeeowww! This means that Yahweh, whom Jewish scholars now say redacts back 
  to Baal, had sex with his mother! Holy screaming Sophocles! There must be a 
  law against saying that! Maybe there will be soon. </b></p>
<p> <b>&quot;According to biblical scholars who focus on the &quot;P Source&quot; 
  for the old testament,&quot; M-Theory writes, &quot;Yahweh as a name is first 
  used with Moses in Exodus, and is indicative of monolatory (exclusive worship 
  of one of many Gods) rather than monotheism. The name Yahweh can also be translated 
  as &quot;I am who I am&quot;, literally a way of saying &quot;mind your own 
  business&quot;, a way of disguising his true identity. Yahweh does not appear 
  until Exodus and, strangely, the god Baal is entirely absent in Genesis.&quot; 
  </b></p>
<p><b> And, the mysterious author adds, in a perfect consistency with the vicious 
  tone of the Old Testament, &quot;This Yahweh is prone to violence and seems 
  to despise his chosen people.&quot; </b><b>Lest I give away M-Theory's entire 
  game, let me just quote one other segment of his fascinating exploration of 
  pre-Christian mythology. </b></p>
<p> <b>&quot;The Hebrews living in Canaan were therefore under Egyptian rule. 
  It is also here in Canaan that we can make a comparison between Yahweh and the 
  Canaanite Moloch (Baal) and extrapolate a polemic inversion of the story of 
  Pharaoh ordering the death of all the &quot;first born&quot; in Exodus. &quot;The 
  worshippers of Moloch sacrificed their first born children to their deity through 
  immolation. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The Fires of War 
  that is)</font><b>. Worshippers of Yahweh in Canaan were also known to carry 
  out child sacrifice on occasion, especially in times of hardship, although immolation 
  (holocaust) was supposedly frowned upon. Slitting the child's throat, however, 
  was acceptable.&quot; </b></p>
<p><b>This information dovetails perfectly with what I've been reading lately 
  in my Talmudic studies on Carol Valentine's eye-opening website Come and Hear 
  &lt;http://www.come-and-hear.com&gt; (a must-read compendium if there ever was 
  one) where the preferred method of execution for innumerable offenses by the 
  goyim (surely you know who they are &#151; they're us, dummy) is DECAPITATION. 
  </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Did someone mention John the 
  Baptist and Paul? Is this a reference to the cryptic verse at Revelation 20:4)?</font></p>
<p><b>So the danger becomes: if Christians and Muslims try to impugn the Jewish 
  faith and declare their god is some minor mountain deity from the hinterlands 
  of Ugarit, they're only going to bring themselves down with it. Because the 
  whole legend of Jesus, which was constructed of equally spurious and unrigorous 
  chicanery, is cobbled together with the same inconsistency, carelessness and 
  manipulation. </b></p>
<p><b>Religion is essentially crowd control, devised by Constantian-type governments 
  to keep the people from rising up against their leaders. It had to be a very 
  rich person who said &quot;the meek shall inherit the earth.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
  Sacrificial Lamb)?</font><b> Anyway, the whole piece &#151; &quot;Shock: Secret 
  Identity Of Israel's Yahweh Revealed!&quot; &#151; is well worth reading for 
  its astonishing Old Testament gossip. Click http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=42815

<p><b>All this folderol goes to show the wisdom on the ancient proscription of 
  trying to give that ineffable and majestic spirit that animates the universe 
  any kind of name whatsoever. You're only asking for trouble if you do, thanks 
  to priests (and ministers and rabbis and whatever kind of guruistic occupational 
  title you want to apply) who value the profitability of the tale they wish to 
  tell higher than the needs of those who need to be reassured that their future 
  is something more than the ignominious dust they will one day surely become.

<p><b> If you want to go looking for the essence of the spirit that animates everything,
