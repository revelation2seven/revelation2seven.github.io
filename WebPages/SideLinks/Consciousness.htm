    the universe as a giant Thought as opposed to a giant machine is further echoed 
    in quantum physics. Jack Sarfatti states, 'signals move through constantly 
    appearing and disappearing (virtual) wormhole connections providing almost 
    instant communication between all parts of space. These signals can be likened 
    to pulses of nerve cells of a great cosmic brain that permeates all parts 
    of space. This point of view is motivated by Einstein's general relativity 
    in the form of Geometrodynamics. A parallel point of view is given in the 
    quantum theory as interpreted by Bohm. In my opinion this is no accident because 
    I suspect that general relativity and quantum theory are simply two complimentary 
    aspects of a deeper theory that will involve a kind of Cosmic Consciousness

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;During their conversations 
    (David Bohm and Albert Einstein) the two men discovered they each had nothing 
    but admiration for the theory's ability to predict phenomena. What bothered 
    them was that it provided no real way of conceiving of the basic structure 
    of the world. Niels Bohr and his followers also claimed that quantum theory 
    was complete and it was not possible to arrive at any clearer understanding 
    of what was going on in the quantum realm. This was the same as saying there 
    was no deeper reality beyond the subatomic landscape, no further answers to 
    be found, and this too grated on both Bohm and Einstein's philosophical sensibilities...Inspired 
    by his interactions with Einstein, he accepted the validity of his misgivings 
    about quantum physics and decided there had to be an alternative view...His 
    mind, ever active and always looking for deeper explanations, was already 
    searching for a better way of describing reality.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A NEW KIND OF FIELD...After his 
    talks with Einstein, Bohm tried to find a workable alternative to Bohr's interpretation. 
    He began by assuming that particles such as electrons do exist in the absence 
    of observers. He also assumed that there was a deeper reality beneath Bohr's 
    inviolable wall, a subquantum level that still awaited its discovery by science. 
    Building on these premises he discovered that simply by proposing the existence 
    of a new kind of field on this subquantum level he was able to explain the 
    findings of quantum physics as well as Bohr could. Bohm called his proposed 
    new field the <i>quantum potential</i> and theorized that, like gravity, it 
    pervaded all of space. However, unlike gravitational fields, magnetic fields, 
    and so on, its influence did not diminish with distance. Its effects were 
    subtle, but it was equally powerful everywhere. Bohm published his alternative 
    interpretation of quantum theory in 1952.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reaction to his new approach was 
    mainly negative. Some physicists were so convinced such alternatives were 
    impossible that they dismissed the ideas his ideas out of hand. </font>(Theologians 
    are that way too)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Others launched 
    passionate attacks against his reasoning. In the end virtually all such arguments 
    were based primarily on philosophical differences, but it did not matter. 
    Bohr's point of view had become so entrenched in physics that Bohm's alternative 
    was looked upon as little more than heresy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the harshness of these 
    attacks Bohm remained unswerving in his convictions that there was more to 
    reality than Bohr's view would allow. He also felt that science was much too 
    limited in its outlook when it came to assessing new ideas such as his own, 
    and in a 1957 book entitled <i>Causality and Chance in Modern Physics</i>, 
    he examined several of the philosophical suppositions responsible for this 
    attitude. One was the widely held assumption that it was possible for any 
    single theory, such as quantum theory, to be complete. Bohm criticized this 
    assumption by pointing out that Nature might be infinite. Because it would 
    not be possible for any theory to completely explain something that is infinite, 
    Bohm suggested that open scientific inquiry might be better served if researchers 
    refrained from making this assumption.&quot; </font>The Holographic Universe,

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Such skepticism notwithstanding, 
    there are also physicists who are sympathetic to Bohm's ideas, including such 
    big guns as Roger Penrose of Oxford, the creator of the modern theory of the

    leading authorities on the conceptual foundations of quantum theory; and Cambridge's 
    Brian Josephson, winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in physics. Josephson believes 
    Bohm's implicate order may someday even lead to the inclusion of God or Mind 
    within the framework of science, an idea Josephson supports.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Considered together, Bohm and (Karl) 
    Pribram's theories provide a profound new way of looking at the world: 'Our 
    brains mathematically construct objective reality by interpreting frequencies 
    that are ultimately projections from another dimension, a deeper order of 
    existence that is beyond both space and time. The brain is a hologram enfolded 
    in a holographic universe.'&quot; </font>The Holographic Universe, p.54<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The holographic idea also 
    sheds light on the unexplainable linkages that can sometimes occur between 
    the consciousnesses of two or more individuals. One of the most famous examples 
    of such linkages is embodied in Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung's concept of 
    a collective unconscious. Early in his career Jung became convinced that the 
    dreams, artwork, fantasies, and hallucinations of his patients often contained 
    symbols and ideas that could not be explained entirely as products of their 
    personal history. Instead, such symbols more closely resembled the images 
    and themes of the world's great mythologies and religions. Jung concluded 
    that myths, dreams, hallucinations, and religious visions all spring from 
    the same source, a collective unconscious that is shared by all people.&quot; 
    </font>The Holographic Universe, pp.59, 60<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Moreover, such dreams were 
    not one-time occurrences. During the course of his practice (Montague) Ullman 
    noticed that when one of his patients failed to recognize or accept some truth 
    about himself, that truth would surface again and again in his dreams, in 
    different metaphorical guises and linked with different related experiences 
    from his past, but always in an apparent attempt to offer him new opportunities 
    to come to terms with the truth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because a man can ignore the counsel 
    of his dreams and still live to be a hundred, Ullman believes this self-monitoring 
    process is striving for more than just the welfare of the individual. He believes 
    that Nature is concerned with the survival of the species. He also agrees 
    with Bohm on the importance of wholeness and feels that dreams are Nature's 
    way of trying to counteract our seemingly unending compulsion to fragment 
    the world. &quot;An individual can disconnect from all that's cooperative, 
    meaningful, and loving and still survive, but nations don't have that luxury. 
    Unless we learn how to overcome all the ways we've fragmented the human race, 
    nationally, religiously, economically, or whatever, we are going to continue 
    to find ourselves in a position where we can accidentally destroy the whole 
    picture...&quot; </font>The Holographic Universe, pp.62,63<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

        of the Collective Unconscious</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have suggested that we 
    think of psychic elements rising up through the unconscious until they eventually 
    enter consciousness. When we think in this way it is natural that we should 
    ask where they come from, and the answer must be that they come from a deeper 
    level of the unconscious. It is, however, to be remembered that when we speak 
    in this way about 'levels' within the unconscious we are using a model. We 
    do not know anything about what the unconscious is in itself, and all we can 
    do is think in terms of models which help us to think about what actually 
    goes on… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is highly probable that great 
    artistic works, great scientific discoveries and many other similar things 
    result from the fact that elements of the Collective Unconscious press forward 
    through consciousness, and in analytic experience people may be faced with 
    the tremendous power of the contents of the Collective Unconscious. Danger 
    arises if the ego becomes confused, and is unable to realize that these elements 
    belong to the Unconscious, and attempts to take charge of them as though they 
    could become an integral part of the conscious personality: it is then that 
    they prove to be too big for the ego, and can cause violent disturbances in 
    man's life…(Four went into Paradise, etc.). Great developments result from 
    the encounter between consciousness and the Collective Unconscious if the 
    ego can cope with the situation; if it cannot it is overwhelmed, either being 
    destroyed or else identifying itself with the Unconscious elements… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jung calls this ultimate and central 
    archetype by many names.. He calls it 'the Self,' and this can lead to confusion 
    if it is not carefully distinguished from '-self', as in 'myself', 'himself', 
    and so on, because these expressions usually refer to consciousness (the &quot;I&quot; 
    of conscious life) whereas 'the Self' refers to the totality of the Psyche, 
    conscious and unconscious. Jung also calls this archetype 'the Image of God' 
    and the 'archetype of Deity', and he tells us that when it is active it expresses 
    itself in ideas and symbols usually connected with the Idea of God. He calls 
    it 'the archetype of Wholeness' because it points to the possibility of living 
    a life in which the psyche functions as a united whole… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From a religious point of view 
    the kind of God whom one would accept if one took this archetype as one's 
    pattern is a God in whom all our human problems are solved, that is, one in 
    whom <i>'</i>all things work together for good;' He is a God who is ultimately 
    responsible for the whole range of natural phenomena, and who is related to 
    the evil and suffering in the world as well as to the good and happiness; 
    He is the One God, united in Himself, in whom all things are joined, and there 
    is no aspect of existence which cannot be related to Him.&quot; </font>Modern

    Hindu myth of "Lila"-the Divine Play-in which Brahman transforms Himself into

  is where the world disappears inward, and where God allows us to see how Their 
  thoughts are interacting across the field of every point of reality. God's thoughts 
  are that 'something behind the energy' that Einstein mused upon. As they appear, 
  in a continuous wave of events, (moment by moment, day by day, year by year), 
  they excite every atom in existence. As each atom is excited history is excited; 
  as history is excited the mind of humanity is excited. The entire image of Creation 
  is imprinted upon the collective psyche of the human family, some of it stored 
  in separate places and some of it in shared places. And just as energy, when 
  it is applied to an individual atom, collects itself in the space that defines 
  the relationship between the orbiting electron(s) and its own nucleus-until 
  some critical (but seemingly indeterminate) point is reached, causing the electron 
  to suddenly jump a quantum leap from one orbit to another, (thus increasing 
  the collective state of the atom)--so history has jumped from one epoch to the 
  next, from empire to empire as it is, leaving lasting impressions on the collective 
  thought patterns of humanity. An atom may experience a series of leaps forcing 
  the electron(s) several times away from its "restful" or inner orbit before 
  the energy it contains is released, in the form of light, and the state of the 
  atom returns (to Jerusalem, and to the mysterious relationship that exists between 
  history and the universe of quantum mechanics.) </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;To look into the strange 
    netherworld of the atom in a slightly different way, let us go back to the 
    early 1920s and see how it all appeared to Niels Bohr…His theory of the atom…pictured 
    the sunlike nucleus as surrounded by planetlike electrons revolving in strictly 
    defined shells around it…and he tied it to the new quantum theory by showing 
    that not only did Kepler's three laws for planets hold in the case of electrons 
    revolving around the nucleus of hydrogen, but another law-a curious quantum 
    law which was not noticeable among bodies as big as planets yet was truly 
    fundamental-also applied. This was the law that electrons can move only in 
    certain orbits and no others. It is a harmonic law akin to the rule that restricts 
    Saturn's rings to precise dimensions… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bohr atom was thus elaborated 
    into Seven shells, roughly analogous to the seven notes of the scale or the 
    seven planets of antiquity, the innermost shell having room for exactly two 
    electrons, the second eight, the third eighteen, and so on, according to the 
    curious rule of the Double Squares…(2 X 1², 2 X 2², 2 X 3², etc.)…But it turned 
    out to be a lot more harmonic order than that, for these shells themselves 
    are sized according to the strangely simple rule of Single Squares. Thus the 
    first shell of the hydrogen atom is one angstrom unit (1A) in diameter, the 
    second is 4A, and the third 9A, etc., which is mathematically reducable to 
    the series 1², 2², 3², 4², up to 7². </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you should wonder how the hydrogen 
    atom with only one electron can have so many shells, it is because any electron 
    may jump from one shell to another and will do so (on the average) as soon 
    as it has acquired the energy. Moreover when a shell is not occupied, it is 
    still there in the abstract, as shown by the fact that an electron can always 
    find it. For the electron never orbits between shells, it always jumps the 
    whole way or not at all…Likewise, an electron may jump down the same series 
    of shells or terraces, giving back to the world its quanta of energy in discrete 
    photons of radiation-Light.&quot; </font>Music of the Spheres, by Guy Murchie,
