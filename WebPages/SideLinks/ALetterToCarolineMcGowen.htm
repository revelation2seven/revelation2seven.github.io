  <p><font size="+1">Dear Caroline McGowen'</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">I was passing through Asheville one weekend last November, 
    and as it happens in the great web of life, our paths crossed for a brief 
    time and touched each other's. My Aunt invited me to attend Mass with her 
    that Sunday at St. Eugene's. I am happy that I went. It was a beautiful service, 
    a folk-mass as they call it. The music and the singing, as well as the spirit 
    of community that seemed to be present there that evening, were altogether 
    sublime. My own spirit was lifted up beyond the rafters. And in the midst 
    of it all was you. Your parents brought you that night to be baptised into 
    the church. Others there may have also sensed the cosmic significance of it 
    all, and if so they had to be caught up with me. The word &quot;church&quot; 
    connotes a &quot;circle of stones,&quot; and ties our thoughts to the ancient 
    Hebrew-Druidical-Christian mystery--to ancient Stonehenge, and most recently 
    to the Guidestones in Georgia where I went to visit the next day. And there 
    you were that night--the center of everyone's attention, and, of course, the 
    center of God's attention also--being initiated into this mystery of Creation, 
    into this great Circle of the Fellowship of Light...This circle of initiation 
    began at the rivers of Eden in the Book of Genesis, and is complete, as it 
    is, (as this age comes to its wonderous and terrible conclusion, and the new 
    is born), where we discover these rivers returning to their source again, 
    in the garden of Eden again, in the Book of Revelation. (Rev.2:7; Ecclesiastes 
    1:1-10). The whole history of the Sacred Scriptures themselves, and of all 
    the oral traditions and written commentaries that attend them, is encompassed 
    by this great Circle. It is one that emerges out of the mist of ancient times, 
    fills the earth with its precepts, and concludes in the bright piercing light 
    of every present natural and human event. God--the whole of Creation itself--has 
    been rising to this wonderous moment in time, to this unfolding final act 
    in the drama of human redemption. It is into this circle that you were born, 
    and into this circle that you were dedicated or baptised that night. Of course, 
    as you grow to spiritual maturity you will eventually have to present yourself 
    to the Holy Spirit, in your own unique way, if you wish or desire Her deeper 
    initiation. In every end, however, and greater than every other hidden aspect 
    of the Universal Mystery, is the mystery of Love itself. Without Love, (true 
    Love), we cannot proceed to the next dimension of reality, into the world 
    above.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">The Mass that evening was deeply significant (at least from 
    my point of view) for another reason as well. So many things were woven so 
    beautifully together there. Deacon Jos gave the most timely and meaningful 
    homily that I have ever heard from a Catholic binah. He asked the assembled 
    believers if &quot;they were ready to stand before the son of man?&quot; He 
    spoke of the times &quot;coming upon us all unaware.&quot; The Catholic Church, 
    as you will discover in your studies, (if you are open to those versions of 
    history that stand counter to the Catholic church's own history of itself), 
    has always marginalized such words as those, shearing them of their fullest 
    meaning and their historical context by referring to them in the way, way 
    distant light of some other time, or some other place, after death, in the 
    next life. But never in the light of our own times, or in the context of present 
    world events. But here the implications for Catholicism are staggering, because 
    it would signal the end of the Catholic world order, the end of the Roman 
    hierarchy (along with all of its historical misinterpretations of Sacred Writ). 
    Deacon Jos spoke of a Messiah who would come to execute justice and righteousness 
    in the land. These are hard words for Catholics, if they pay any attention 
    to them, because as you grow older you will also discover that the Catholic 
    people (along with all others), and the Catholic church, have done many evil 
    things in the world since the time of Christ, and they have done them in the 
    name of Jesus--the very name that was bestowed upon you in addition to your 
    own at baptism. And what's more, we are still doing them--only now we have 
    convinced ourselves that we are doing good. We Catholics are very confused 
    about matters of good and evil, partly because we have become so accustomed 
    to listening to the religious and political leaders instead of our own hearts. 
    (But often times they make us afrain to think and act for ourselves). And 
    then sometimes we are confused because we do listen to ourselves when we should 
    be listening to others. (The Divine Spirit will teach us who to listen to, 
    and when, if we will keep our hearts and minds open to Her). We often think 
    we are doing good, when in fact, in the eyes of God, we are doing extremely 
    evil. Even the beautiful land surrounding and including Asheville where you 
    were born was stolen from its native inhabitants, and all of it has to be 
    given back when the son of man appears. Becoming aware of these things, and 
    of the epic implications of God's laws, is all part of growing and maturing 
    in the Catholic faith. It causes us to realize exactly why the God of History 
    is about to execute judgment and justice in the ends of the earth. And this 
    is why Deacon Jos' words were so important. They are signalling an important 
    and spiritually timely shift in American Catholic consciousness.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Some say I am not a Catholic anymore, and I am sure they 
    are correct. When I was growing up in St. Martin of Tours parish in Brooklyn 
    I was going to become a priest. But God intervened in a most wonderful way 
    and sent a beautiful little redhead into my life, who thought of God even 
    more than I did. She helped me to see and learn many things about God, and 
    about life, that many Catholic priests are not aware of, and can only think 
    about. And she, Like God Herself, (and, of course, Himself), was able to bring 
    children into the world, just like you. For this is what God is--LIFE. And 
    you are Life.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">And children, as you and I know, are open to many more things 
    of the Spirit than adults, who have become fixed and stubborn in their ideas--even, 
    strangely enough, when their ideas are historically incorrect and lead constantly 
    to divisions, confusions, warfare, and death instead of Life. And needless 
    to say Catholics have been embroiled in all of these things since the day 
    the church made that unholy marriage and alliance between itself and the Roman 
    empire in the time of Constantine. This is why I am sending you these notes 
    and excerpts from An History and a Commentary on the Tree of Life, and some 
    other notes on a very old discipline of study known as Kabbalah. This discipline 
    gave birth to, and has been energizing the inner life of the Church since 
    before the time of Christ itself. The reason many Catholics are not familiar 
    with it, (although many are), is that for the longest time if any Catholic 
    (or Jew or other so-called heritics) were caught studying and speaking out 
    loud about these things, they were killed. This was the diabolical work of 
    the Catholic Inquisition, (for which the pope is now seeking absolution). 
    Of course they are not allowed to do that any more--at least for the immediate 
    time being--so I will send them to you hoping that you will study them when 
    you get older, and that you will be free to follow the Spirit wherever She 
    will lead you at that time. But if the times we live in begin to intensify 
    as Deacon Jos suggested--because the son of man has suddenly appeared on the 
    scene, and because God has risen up in the sum of human affairs as well, to 
    cast down all of our idols and the ideas and institutions we have come to 
    place so much faith in--maybe the older people in your church will take the 
    time to reaquaint themselves with the oracles also. </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">In the meantime thank you for inviting me to your baptism. 
    Perhaps between us we can help others to see, that while the Mass that night 
    was very beautiful, there are others of God's sons and daughters (the Remnant 
    in our time) who are preparing to become the age-ending meaning of this historic 
    ritual observance. They are preparing to drink down the Cup and offer themselves 
    as the Evening Sacrifice.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Even though the people in your church wont understand these 
    things right off, have them read them anyway. The ideas expressed here will 
    define the conversation that will surround the manifestation of the son of 
    man in our time.</font></p>
