<p align="center">THE WAGES OF APPEASEMENT<br>
  HOW JIMMY CARTER AND ACADEMIC MULTICULTURALISTS HELPED BRING US SEPT. 11. </p>
<p align="center">BY VICTOR DAVIS HANSON <br>
  Monday, May 10, 2004 12:01 a.m. EDT </p>
<p>Imagine a different Nov. 4, 1979, in Tehran. Shortly after Iranian terrorists 
  storm the American Embassy and take some 90 American hostages, President Carter 
  announces that Islamic fundamentalism is not a legitimate response to the excess 
  of the shah but a new and dangerous fascism that threatens all that liberal 
  society holds dear. And then he issues an ultimatum to Tehran's leaders: Release 
  the captives or face a devastating military response.</p>
<p>When that demand is not met, instead of freezing Iran's assets, stopping the 
  importation of its oil, or seeking support at the U.N., Mr. Carter orders an 
  immediate blockade of the country, followed by promises to bomb, first, all 
  of its major military assets, and then its main government buildings and residences 
  of its ruling mullocracy. The Ayatollah Khomeini might well have called his 
  bluff; we may well have tragically lost the hostages (151 fewer American lives 
  than the Iranian-backed Hezbollah would take four years later in a single day 
  in Lebanon). And there might well have been the sort of chaos in Tehran that 
  we now witness in Baghdad. But we would have seen it all in 1979--and not in 
  2001, after almost a quarter-century of continuous Middle East terrorism, culminating 
  in the mass murder of 3,000 Americans and the leveling of the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>The 20th century should have taught the citizens of liberal democracies the 
  catastrophic consequences of placating tyrants. British and French restraint 
  over the occupation of the Rhineland, the Anschluss, the absorption of the Czech 
  Sudetenland, and the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia did not win gratitude 
  but rather Hitler's contempt for their weakness. Fifty million dead, the Holocaust 
  and the near destruction of European civilization were the wages of &quot;appeasement&quot;--a 
  term that early-1930s liberals proudly embraced as far more enlightened than 
  the old idea of &quot;deterrence&quot; and &quot;military readiness.&quot;</p>
<p>So too did Western excuses for the Russians' violation of guarantees of free 
  elections in postwar Eastern Europe, China and Southeast Asia only embolden 
  the Soviet Union. What eventually contained Stalinism was the Truman Doctrine, 
  NATO and nuclear deterrence--not the United Nations--and what destroyed its 
  legacy was Ronald Reagan's assertiveness, not Jimmy Carter's accommodation or 
  Richard Nixon's d&eacute;tente.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As long ago as the fourth century B.C., Demosthenes warned how complacency 
  and self-delusion among an affluent and free Athenian people allowed a Macedonian 
  thug like Philip II to end some four centuries of Greek liberty--and in a mere 
  20 years of creeping aggrandizement down the Greek peninsula. Thereafter, these 
  historical lessons should have been clear to citizens of any liberal society: 
  We must neither presume that comfort and security are our birthrights and are 
  guaranteed without constant sacrifice and vigilance, nor expect that peoples 
  outside the purview of bourgeois liberalism share our commitment to reason, 
  tolerance and enlightened self-interest.<br>
</p>
<p>Most important, military deterrence and the willingness to use force against 
  evil in its infancy usually end up, in the terrible arithmetic of war, saving 
  more lives than they cost. All this can be a hard lesson to relearn each generation, 
  especially now that we contend with the sirens of the mall, Oprah and latte. 
  Our affluence and leisure are as antithetical to the use of force as rural life 
  and relative poverty once were catalysts for muscular action. The age-old lure 
  of appeasement--perhaps they will cease with this latest concession, perhaps 
  we provoked our enemies, perhaps demonstrations of our future good intentions 
  will win their approval--was never more evident than in the recent Spanish elections, 
  when an affluent European electorate, reeling from the horrific terrorist attack 
  of 3/11, swept from power the pro-U.S. center-right government on the grounds 
  that the mass murders were more the fault of the United States for dragging 
  Spain into the effort to remove fascists and implant democracy in Iraq than 
  of the primordial al Qaedaist culprits, who long ago promised the Western and 
  Christian Iberians ruin for the Crusades and the Reconquista.</p>
<p>What went wrong with the West--and with the United States in particular--when 
  not just the classical but especially the recent antecedents to Sept. 11, from 
  the Iranian hostage-taking to the attack on the USS Cole, were so clear? Though 
  Americans in an election year, legitimately concerned about our war dead, may 
  now be divided over the Iraqi occupation, polls nevertheless show a surprising 
  consensus that the many precursors to the World Trade Center and Pentagon bombings 
  were acts of war, not police matters. Roll the tape backward from the USS Cole 
  in 2000, through the bombing of the U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 and 
  the Khobar Towers in 1996, the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, the 
  destruction of the American Embassy and annex in Beirut in 1983, the mass murder 
  of 241 U.S. Marine peacekeepers asleep in their Lebanese barracks that same 
  year, and assorted kidnappings and gruesome murders of American citizens and 
  diplomats (including TWA Flight 800, Pan Am 103, William R. Higgins, Leon Klinghoffer, 
  Robert Dean Stethem and CIA operative William Francis Buckley), until we arrive 
  at the Iranian hostage-taking of November 1979: That debacle is where we first 
  saw the strange brew of Islamic fascism, autocracy and Middle East state terrorism--and 
  failed to grasp its menace, condemn it and go to war against it.</p>
<p>That lapse, worth meditating upon in this 25th anniversary year of Khomeinism, 
  then set the precedent that such aggression against the United States was better 
  adjudicated as a matter of law than settled by war. Criminals were to be understood, 
  not punished; and we, not our enemies, were at fault for our past behavior. 
  Whether Mr. Carter's impotence sprang from his deep-seated moral distrust of 
  using American power unilaterally or from real remorse over past American actions 
  in the Cold War or even from his innate pessimism about the military capability 
  of the United States mattered little to the hostage takers in Tehran, who for 
  444 days humiliated the United States through a variety of public demands for 
  changes in U.S. foreign policy, the return of the exiled shah, and reparations.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But if we know how we failed to respond in the last three decades, do we yet 
  grasp why we were so afraid to act decisively at these earlier junctures, which 
  might have stopped the chain of events that would lead to the al Qaeda terrorist 
  acts of Sept/ 11? Our failure was never due to a lack of the necessary wealth 
  or military resources, but rather to a deeply ingrained assumption that we should 
  not retaliate--a hesitancy al Qaeda perceives and plays upon.</p>
<p>Along that sad succession of provocations, we can look back and see particularly 
  critical turning points that reflected this now-institutionalized state policy 
  of worrying more about what the enemy was going to do to us than we to him, 
  to paraphrase Grant's dictum: not hammering back after the murder of the Marines 
  in Lebanon for fear of ending up like the Israelis in a Lebanese quagmire; not 
  going to Baghdad in 1991 because of paranoia that the &quot;coalition&quot; 
  would collapse and we would polarize the Arabs; pulling abruptly out of Somalia 
  once pictures of American bodies dragged through the streets of Mogadishu were 
  broadcast around the world; or turning down offers in 1995 from Sudan to place 
  Osama bin Laden into our custody, for fear that U.S. diplomats or citizens might 
  be murdered abroad.</p>
<p>Throughout this tragic quarter-century of appeasement, our response usually 
  consisted of a stern lecture by a Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, 
  or Bill Clinton about &quot;never giving in to terrorist blackmail&quot; and 
  &quot;not negotiating with terrorists.&quot; Even Mr. Reagan's saber-rattling 
  &quot;You can run but not hide&quot; did not preclude trading arms to the Iranian 
  terrorists or abruptly abandoning Lebanon after the horrific Hezbollah attack.</p>
<p>Sometimes a half-baked failed rescue mission, or a battleship salvo, cruise 
  missile or air strike, followed--but always accompanied by a weeklong debate 
  by conservatives over &quot;exit strategies&quot; and &quot;mission creep,&quot; 
  while liberals fretted about &quot;consultations with our allies and the United 
  Nations.&quot; And remember: these pathetic military responses were the hawkish 
  actions that earned us the resignation of a furious Cyrus Vance, the abrogation 
  of overflight rights by concerned &quot;allies&quot; such as France, and a national 
  debate about what we did to cause such animosity in the first place.</p>
<p>Our enemies and Middle Eastern &quot;friends&quot; alike sneered at our self-flagellation. 
  In 1991, at great risk, the United States freed Kuwait from Iraq and ended its 
  status as the 19th satrapy of Saddam Hussein--only to watch the restored kingdom 
  ethnically cleanse over a third of a million Palestinians. But after the murder 
  of 3,000 Americans in 2001, Kuwaitis, in a February 2002 Gallup poll (and while 
  they lobbied OPEC to reduce output and jack up prices), revealed an overwhelming 
  distaste for Americans--indeed the highest levels of anti-Americanism in the 
  Arab world. And these ethnic cleansers of Palestinians cited America's purportedly 
  unfair treatment of the Palestinians (recipients of accumulated billions in 
  American aid) as a prime cause of their dislike of us. </p>
<p>In the face of such visceral anti-Americanism, the problem may not be real 
  differences over the West Bank, much less that &quot;we are not getting the 
  message out&quot;; rather, in the decade since 1991 the Middle East saw us as 
  a great power that neither could nor would use its strength to advance its ideas--that 
  lacked even the intellectual confidence to argue for our civilization before 
  the likes of a tenth-century monarchy. The autocratic Arab world neither respects 
  nor fears a democratic United States, because it rightly senses that we often 
  talk in principled terms but rarely are willing to invest the time, blood and 
  treasure to match such rhetoric with concrete action. That's why it is crucial 
  for us to stay in Iraq to finish the reconstruction and cement the achievement 
  of our three-week victory over Saddam.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is easy to cite post-Vietnam guilt and shame as the likely culprit for our 
  paralysis. After all, Jimmy Carter came in when memories of capsizing boat people 
  and of American helicopters lifting swarms of panicked diplomats off the roof 
  of the Saigon embassy were fresh. In 1981, he exited in greater shame: his effusive 
  protestations that Soviet communism wasn't something to fear all that much won 
  him the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while his heralded &quot;human rights&quot; 
  campaign was answered by the Ortegas in Nicaragua and the creation of a murderous 
  theocracy in Iran. Yet perhaps President Carter was not taking the American 
  people anywhere they didn't want to go. After over a decade of prior social 
  unrest and national humiliation in Vietnam, many Americans believed that the 
  United States either could not or should not do much about things beyond its 
  shores.<br>
  As time wore on and the nightmare of Vietnam began to fade, fear of the Soviet 
  Union kept us from crushing the terrorists who killed our diplomats and blew 
  up our citizens. These were no idle fears, given the Russians' record of butchering 
  30 million of their own, stationing 300 divisions on Europe's borders, and pointing 
  7,000 nukes at the United States. And fear of their malevolence made eminent 
  sense in the volatile Middle East, where the Russians made direct threats to 
  the Israelis in both the 1967 and 1973 wars, when the Syrian, Egyptian and Iraqi 
  militaries--trained, supplied and advised by Russians--were on the verge of 
  annihilation. Russian support for Nasser's Pan-Arabism and for Baathism in Iraq 
  and Syria rightly worried Cold Warriors, who sensed that the Soviets had their 
  geopolitical eyes on Middle East oil and a stranglehold over Persian Gulf commerce.</p>
<p>Indeed, these twin pillars of the old American Middle East policy--worry over 
  oil and fear of communists--reigned for nearly half a century, between 1945 
  and 1991. Such realism, however understandable, was counterproductive in the 
  long run, since our tacit support for odious anticommunist governments in Saudi 
  Arabia, the Gulf states and North Africa did not address the failure of such 
  autocracies to provide prosperity and hope for exploding populations of increasingly 
  poor and angry citizens. We kept Russians out of the oilfields and ensured safe 
  exports of petroleum to Europe, Japan and the U.S.--but at what proved to be 
  the steep price of allowing awful regimes to deflect popular discontent against 
  us. </p>
<p>Nor was Realpolitik always effective. Such illegitimate Arab regimes as the 
  Saudi royal family initiated several oil embargoes, after all. And meanwhile, 
  such a policy did not deter the Soviets from busily selling high-tech weaponry 
  to Libya, Syria and Iraq, while the KGB helped to train and fund almost every 
  Arab terrorist group. And indeed, immediately after the 1991 Iraqi takeover 
  of Kuwait, U.S. intelligence officers discovered that Soviet-trained Abu Nidal, 
  Abu Abbas and Abu Ibrahim had flocked to Baghdad on the invitation of the Baathist 
  Saddam Hussein: though the Soviet Union did not interrupt Western petroleum 
  commerce, its well-supplied surrogates did their fair share of murdering.</p>
<p>Neither thirst for petroleum nor fear of communists, then, adequately explains 
  our inaction for most of the tumultuous late 1980s and 1990s, when groups like 
  Hezbollah and al Qaeda came on to the world scene. Mikhail Gorbachev's tottering 
  empire had little inclination to object too strenuously when the United States 
  hit Libya in 1986, recall, and thanks to the growing diversity and fungibility 
  of the global oil supply, we haven't had a full-fledged Arab embargo since 1979.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead, the primary cause for our surprising indifference to the events leading 
  up to Sept. 11 lies within ourselves. Westerners always have had a propensity 
  for complacency because of our wealth and freedom; and Americans in particular 
  have enjoyed a comfortable isolation in being separated from the rest of the 
  world by two oceans. Yet during the last four presidential administrations, 
  laxity about danger on the horizon seems to have become more ingrained than 
  in the days when a more robust United States sought to thwart communist intrusion 
  into Arabia, Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>Americans never viewed terrorist outlaw states with the suspicion they once 
  had toward Soviet communism; they put little pressure on their leaders to crack 
  down on Middle Eastern autocracy and theocracy as a threat to security. At first 
  this indifference was understandable, given the stealthy nature of our enemies 
  and the post-Cold War relief that, having toppled the Soviet Union and freed 
  millions in Eastern Europe, we might be at the end of history. Even the bloodcurdling 
  anti-American shouts from the Beirut street did not seem as scary as a procession 
  of intercontinental missiles and tanks on an average May Day parade in Moscow. 
</p>
<p>Hezbollah, al Qaeda and the Palestine Liberation Organization were more like 
  fleas on a sleeping dog: bothersome rather than lethal; to be flicked away occasionally 
  rather than systematically eradicated. Few paid attention to Osama bin Laden's 
  infamous February 1998 fatwa: &quot;The rule to kill Americans and their allies--civilians 
  and military--is a sacred duty for any Muslim.&quot; Those who noticed thought 
  it just impotent craziness, akin to Sartre's fatuous quip during the Vietnam 
  War that he wished for a nuclear strike against the United States to end its 
  imperial aspirations. No one thought that a raving maniac in an Afghan cave 
  could kill more Americans in a single day than the planes of the Japanese imperial 
  fleet off Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>But still, how did things as odious to liberal sensibilities as Pan-Arabism, 
  Islamic fundamentalism and Middle Eastern dictatorship--which squashed dissent, 
  mocked religious tolerance, and treated women as chattel--become reinvented 
  into &quot;alternate discourses&quot; deserving a sympathetic pass from the 
  righteous anger of the United States when Americans were murdered overseas? 
  Was it that spokesmen for terrorist regimes mimicked the American left--in everything 
  from dress, vocabulary and appearances on the lecture circuit--and so packaged 
  their extremism in a manner palatable to Americans? Why, after all, were Americans 
  patient with remonstrations from University of Virginia alumna Hanan Ashrawi, 
  rather than asking precisely how such a wealthy Christian PLO apparatchik really 
  felt about the Palestinian Authority's endemic corruption, the spendthrift Parisian 
  Suha Arafat, the terrorists around her husband himself, the spate of &quot;honor 
  killings&quot; of women in the West Bank, the censorship of the Palestinian 
  press, suicide-murdering by Arafat affiliates, and the lynching of suspects 
  by Palestinian police? </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Rather than springing from Realpolitik, sloth or fear of oil cutoffs, much 
  of our appeasement of Middle Eastern terrorists derived from a new sort of anti-Americanism 
  that thrived in the growing therapeutic society of the 1980s and 1990s. Though 
  the abrupt collapse of communism was a dilemma for the left, it opened as many 
  doors as it shut. To be sure, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, few Marxists 
  could argue for a state-controlled economy or mouth the old romance about a 
  workers' paradise--not with scenes of East German families crammed into smoking 
  clunkers lumbering over potholed roads, like American pioneers of old on their 
  way west. But if the creed of the socialist republics was impossible to take 
  seriously in either economic or political terms, such a collapse of doctrinaire 
  statism did not discredit the gospel of forced egalitarianism and resentment 
  against prosperous capitalists. Far from it.<br>
</p>
<p>If Marx receded from economics departments, his spirit re-emerged among our 
  intelligentsia in the novel guises of poststructuralism, new historicism, multiculturalism 
  and all the other dogmas whose fundamental tenet was that white male capitalists 
  had systematically oppressed women, minorities and Third World people in countless 
  insidious ways. The font of that collective oppression, both at home and abroad, 
  was the rich, corporate, Republican and white United States.</p>
<p>The fall of the Soviet Union enhanced these newer postcolonial and liberation 
  fields of study by immunizing their promulgators from charges of fellow-traveling 
  or being dupes of Russian expansionism. Communism's demise likewise freed these 
  trendy ideologies from having to offer some wooden, unworkable Marxist alternative 
  to the West; thus they could happily remain entirely critical, sarcastic and 
  cynical without any obligation to suggest something better, as witness the nihilist 
  signs at recent protest marches proclaiming: &quot;I Love Iraq, Bomb Texas.&quot;</p>
<p>From writers like Arundhati Roy and Michel Foucault (who anointed Khomeini 
  &quot;a kind of mystic saint&quot; who would usher in a new &quot;political 
  spirituality&quot; that would &quot;transfigure&quot; the world) and from old 
  standbys like Frantz Fanon and Jean-Paul Sartre (&quot;to shoot down a European 
  is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he 
  oppresses at the same time&quot;), there filtered down a vague notion that the 
  United States and the West in general were responsible for Third World misery 
  in ways that transcended the dull old class struggle. Endemic racism and the 
  legacy of colonialism, the oppressive multinational corporation and the humiliation 
  and erosion of indigenous culture brought on by globalization and a smug, self-important 
  cultural condescension--all this and more explained poverty and despair, whether 
  in Damascus, Tehran or Beirut.</p>
<p>There was victim status for everybody, from gender, race and class at home 
  to colonialism, imperialism and hegemony abroad. Anyone could play in these 
  &quot;area studies&quot; that cobbled together the barrio, the West Bank and 
  the &quot;freedom fighter&quot; into some sloppy global union of the oppressed--a 
  far hipper enterprise than rehashing &quot;Das Kapital&quot; or listening to 
  a six-hour harangue from Fidel.</p>
<p>Of course, pampered Western intellectuals since Diderot have always dreamed 
  up a &quot;noble savage,&quot; who lived in harmony with nature precisely because 
  of his distance from the corruption of Western civilization. But now this fuzzy 
  romanticism had an updated, political edge: The bearded killer and wild-eyed 
  savage were not merely better than we because they lived apart in a premodern 
  landscape. No, they had a right to strike back and kill modernizing Westerners 
  who had intruded into and disrupted their better world--whether Jews on Temple 
  Mount, women in Westernized dress in Tehran, Christian missionaries in Kabul, 
  capitalist profiteers in Islamabad, whiskey-drinking oilmen in Riyadh, or miniskirted 
  tourists in Cairo.</p>
<p>An Ayatollah Khomeini who turned back the clock on female emancipation in Iran, 
  who murdered non-Muslims, and who refashioned Iranian state policy to hunt down, 
  torture and kill liberals nevertheless seemed to liberal Western eyes as preferable 
  to the shah--a Western-supported anticommunist, after all, who was engaged in 
  the messy, often corrupt task of bringing Iran from the 10th to the 20th century, 
  down the arduous, dangerous path that, as in Taiwan or South Korea, might eventually 
  lead to a consensual, capitalist society like our own.</p>
<p>Yet in the new world of utopian multiculturalism and knee-jerk anti-Americanism, 
  in which a Noam Chomsky could proclaim Khomeini's gulag to be &quot;independent 
  nationalism,&quot; reasoned argument was futile. Indeed, how could critical 
  debate arise for those &quot;committed to social change,&quot; when no universal 
  standards were to be applied to those outside the West? Thanks to the doctrine 
  of cultural relativism, &quot;oppressed&quot; peoples either could not be judged 
  by our biased and &quot;constructed&quot; values (&quot;false universals,&quot; 
  in Edward Said's infamous term) or were seen as more pristine than ourselves, 
  uncorrupted by the evils of Western capitalism. </p>
<p>Who were we to gainsay Khomeini's butchery and oppression? We had no way of 
  understanding the nuances of his new liberationist and &quot;nationalist&quot; 
  Islam. Now back in the hands of indigenous peoples, Iran might offer the world 
  an alternate path, a different &quot;discourse&quot; about how to organize a 
  society that emphasized native values (of some sort) over mere profit. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So at precisely the time of these increasingly frequent terrorist attacks, 
  the silly gospel of multiculturalism insisted that Westerners have neither earned 
  the right to censure others, nor do they possess the intellectual tools to make 
  judgments about the relative value of different cultures. And if the initial 
  wave of multiculturalist relativism among the elites--coupled with the age-old 
  romantic forbearance for Third World roguery--explained tolerance for early 
  unpunished attacks on Americans, its spread to our popular culture only encouraged 
  more.</p>
<p>This nonjudgmentalism--essentially a form of nihilism--deemed everything from 
  Sudanese female circumcision to honor killings on the West Bank merely &quot;different&quot; 
  rather than odious. Anyone who has taught freshmen at a state university can 
  sense the fuzzy thinking of our undergraduates: Most come to us prepped in high 
  schools not to make &quot;value judgments&quot; about &quot;other&quot; peoples 
  who are often &quot;victims&quot; of American &quot;oppression.&quot; Thus, 
  before female-hating psychopath Mohamed Atta piloted a jet into the World Trade 
  Center, neither Western intellectuals nor their students would have taken him 
  to task for what he said or condemned him as hypocritical for his parasitical 
  existence on Western society. Instead, without logic but with plenty of romance, 
  they would more likely have excused him as a victim of globalization or of the 
  biases of American foreign policy. They would have deconstructed Atta's promotion 
  of anti-Semitic, misogynist, Western-hating thought, as well as his conspiracies 
  with Third World criminals, as anything but a danger and a pathology to be remedied 
  by deportation or incarceration.</p>
<p>It was not for nothing that on Nov. 17, 1979--less than two weeks after the 
  militants stormed the American Embassy in Tehran--the Ayatollah Khomeini ordered 
  the release of 13 female and black hostages, singling them out as part of the 
  brotherhood of those oppressed by the United States and cloaking his continuing 
  slaughter of Iranian opponents and attacks on U.S. sovereignty in a self-righteous 
  anti-Americanism. Twenty-five years later, during the antiwar protests of last 
  spring, a group called Act Now to Stop War and End Racism sang the same foolish 
  chorus in its call for demonstrations: &quot;Members of the Muslim Community, 
  Antiwar Activists, Latin-American Solidarity Groups and People From All Over 
  the United States Unite to Say: 'We Are All Palestinians!' &quot;</p>
<p>The new cult of romantic victimhood became gospel in most Middle East departments 
  in American universities. Except for the courageous Bernard Lewis, Daniel Pipes 
  and Fouad Ajami, few scholars offered any analysis that might confirm more astute 
  Americans in their vague sense that in the Middle East, political autocracy, 
  statism, tribalism, anti-intellectualism and gender apartheid accounted for 
  poverty and failure. And if few wished to take on Islamofascism in the 1990s--indeed, 
  Steven Emerson's chilling 1994 documentary &quot;Jihad in America&quot; set 
  off a storm of protest from U.S. Muslim-rights groups and prompted death threats 
  to the producer--almost no one but Samuel Huntington dared even to broach the 
  taboo subject that there might be elements within doctrinaire Islam itself that 
  could easily lead to intolerance and violence and were therefore at the root 
  of any &quot;clash of civilizations.&quot;</p>
<p>Instead, most experts explained why violent fanatics might have some half-legitimate 
  grievance behind their deadly harvest each year of a few Americans in the wrong 
  place at the wrong time. These experts cautioned that,instead of bombing and 
  shooting killers abroad who otherwise would eventually reach us at home, Americans 
  should take care not to disturb Iranian terrorists during Ramadan--rather than 
  to remember that Muslims attacked Israel precisely during that holy period. 
  Instead of condemning Wahhabis for the fascists that they were, we were instead 
  apprised that such holy men of the desert and tent provided a rapidly changing 
  and often Western-corrupted Saudi Arabia with a vital tether to the stability 
  of its romantic nomadic past. Rather than recognizing that Yasser Arafat's Tunisia-based 
  Fatah organization was a crime syndicate, expert opinion persuaded us to empower 
  it as an indigenous liberation movement on the West Bank--only to destroy nearly 
  two decades' worth of steady Palestinian economic improvement.</p>
<p>Neither oil-concerned Republicans nor multicultural Democrats were ready to 
  expose the corrupt American relationship with Saudi Arabia. No country is more 
  culpable than that kingdom in funding extremist madrassas and subsidizing terror, 
  or more antithetical to liberal American values from free speech to religious 
  tolerance. But Saudi propagandists learned from the Palestinians the value of 
  constructing their own victimhood as a long-oppressed colonial people. Call 
  a Saudi fundamentalist mullah a fascist, and you can be sure you'll be tarred 
  as an Islamophobe.</p>
<p>Even when Middle Easterners regularly blew us up, the Clinton administration, 
  unwilling to challenge the new myth of Muslim victimhood, transformed Middle 
  Eastern terrorists bent on destroying America into wayward individual criminals 
  who did not spring from a pathological culture. Thus, President Clinton treated 
  the first World Trade Center bombing as only a criminal-justice matter--which 
  of course allowed the U.S. to avoid confronting the issue and taking on the 
  messy and increasingly unpopular business the Bush administration has been engaged 
  in since Sept. 11. Clinton dispatched FBI agents, not soldiers, to Yemen and 
  Saudi Arabia after the attacks on the USS Cole and the Khobar Towers. Yasser 
  Arafat, responsible in the 1970s for the murder of a U.S. diplomat in Sudan, 
  turned out to be the most frequent foreign visitor to the Clinton Oval Office.

<p>If the Clintonian brand of appeasement reflected both a deep-seated tolerance 
  for Middle Eastern extremism and a reluctance to wake comfortable Americans 
  up to the danger of a looming war, he was not the only one naive about the threat 
  of Islamic fascism. Especially culpable was the Democratic Party at large, whose 
  post-Vietnam foreign policy could not sanction the use of American armed force 
  to protect national interests but only to accomplish purely humanitarian ends 
  as in the interventions in Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. </p>
<p>Indeed, the recent Democratic primaries reveal just how far this disturbing 
  trend has evolved: the foreign-policy positions of John Kerry and Howard Dean 
  on Iraq and the Middle East were far closer to those of extremists like Al Sharpton 
  and Dennis Kucinich than to current American policy under George W. Bush. Indeed, 
  buffoons or conspiracy theorists like Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore and Al Franken 
  often turned up on the same stage as would-be presidents. When Mr. Moore, while 
  endorsing Wesley Clark, called an American president at a time of war a &quot;deserter,&quot; 
  when the mendacious Mr. Sharpton lectured his smiling fellow candidates on the 
  Bush administration's &quot;lies&quot; about Iraq, and when Al Gore labeled 
  the president's action in Iraq a &quot;betrayal&quot; of America, the surrender 
  of the mainstream Democrats to the sirens of extremism was complete. Again, 
  past decorum and moderation go out the window when the pretext is saving indigenous 
  peoples from American oppression.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The consensus for appeasement that led to Sept. 11, albeit suppressed for nearly 
  two years by outrage over the murder of 3,000, has re-emerged in criticism over 
  the ongoing reconstruction of Iraq and President Bush's prosecution of the War 
  on Terror.<br>
  The tired voices that predicted a litany of horrors in October 2001--the impassable 
  peaks of Afghanistan, millions of refugees, endemic starvation, revolution in 
  the Arab street and violations of Ramadan--now complain, incorrectly, that 150,000 
  looted art treasures were the cost of guarding the Iraqi oil ministry, that 
  Halliburton pipelines and refineries were the sole reason to remove Saddam Hussein, 
  and that Christian fundamentalists and fifth-columnist neoconservatives have 
  fomented a senseless revenge plot against Muslims and Arabs. Whether they complained 
  before March 2003 that America faced death and ruin against Saddam's Republican 
  Guard, or two months later that in bullying fashion we had walked over a suddenly 
  impotent enemy, or three months later still that, through incompetence, we were 
  taking casualties and failing to get the power back on, leftist critics' only 
  constant was their predictable dislike of America.</p>
<p>Military historians might argue that, given the enormity of our task in Iraq--liberating 
  26 million from a tyrant and implanting democracy in the region--the tragic 
  loss of more than 500 Americans in a year's war and peace was a remarkable sign 
  of our care and expertise in minimizing deaths. Diplomats might argue that our 
  past efforts at humanitarian reconstruction, with some idealistic commitment 
  to consensual government, have a far better track record in Germany, Japan, 
  Korea, Panama and Serbia than our strategy of exiting Germany after World War 
  I, of leaving Iraq to Saddam after 1991, of abandoning Afghanistan to the Taliban 
  once the Russians were stopped, of skipping out from Haiti or of fleeing Somalia. 
  Realist students of arms control might argue that the recent confessions of 
  Pakistan's nuclear roguery, the surrender of the Libyan arsenal, and the invitation 
  of the U.N. inspectors into Iran were the dividends of resolute American action 
  in Iraq. Moammar Gadhafi surely came clean not because of Jimmy Carter's peace 
  missions, U.N. resolutions, or European diplomats.</p>
<p>But don't expect any sober discussion of these contentions from the left. Their 
  gloom and doom about Iraq arises precisely from the anti-Americanism and romanticization 
  of the Third World that once led to our appeasement and now seeks its return. 
  When John Kerry talks of mysterious prominent Europeans he has met (but whose 
  names he will not divulge) who, he says, pray for his election in hopes of ending 
  Mr. Bush's Iraqi nightmare, perhaps he has in mind people like the Chamberlainesque 
  European Commission president Romano Prodi, who said in the wake of the recent 
  mass murder in Spain: &quot;Clearly, the conflict with the terrorists is not 
  resolved with force alone.&quot; Perhaps he has in mind, also, the Spanish electorate, 
  which believes it can find security from al Qaeda terrorism by refuting all 
  its past support for America's role in the Middle East. But of course if the 
  terrorists understand that, in lieu of resolve, they will find such appeasement 
  a mere 72 hours after a terrorist attack, then all previously resolute Western 
  democracies--Italy, Poland, Britain and the United States--should expect the 
  terrorists to murder their citizens on the election eve in hopes of achieving 
  just such a Spanish-style capitulation.</p>
<p>In contrast, George W. Bush, impervious to such self-deception, has, in a mere 
  2 1/2 years, reversed the perilous course of a quarter-century. Since Sept. 
  11, he has removed the Taliban and Saddam Hussein, begun to challenge the Middle 
  East through support for consensual government, isolated Yasser Arafat, pressured 
  the Europeans on everything from anti-Semitism to their largesse to Hamas, removed 
  American troops from Saudi Arabia, shut down fascistic Islamic &quot;charities,&quot; 
  scattered al Qaeda, turned Pakistan from a de facto foe to a scrutinized neutral, 
  rounded up terrorists in the United States, pressured Libya, Iran and Pakistan 
  to come clean on clandestine nuclear cheating, so far avoided another Sept. 
  11--and promises that he is not nearly done yet. If the Spanish example presages 
  further terrorist attacks on European democracies at election time, at least 
  Mr. Bush has made it clear that America--alone if need be--will neither appease 
  nor ignore such killers but in fact finish the terrible war that they started.</p>
<p>As Jimmy Carter also proved in November 1979, one man really can make a difference.
