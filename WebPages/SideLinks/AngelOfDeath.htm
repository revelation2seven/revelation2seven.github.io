  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Not being a professional 
    historian, </font>(or a theologian)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    I take on this essay with fear and trembling. That's because, although defeated, 
    although dead, this man is frightening. What was the secret of his Power over 
    his listeners? His demagogic appeal to immoderation, to excess and to simplifying 
    hate? They spoke of his intuitive powers and his &quot;luck&quot; (he escaped 
    several attempts on his life).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adolph Hitler or the incarnation 
    of absolute evil: this is how future generations will remember the all-powerful 
    Fuhrer of the criminal Third Reich. Compared with him, his peers Mussolini 
    and Franco were novices. Under his hypnotic gaze, humanity crossed a threshold 
    from which one could see the abyss.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time that he terrorized 
    his adversaries, he knew how to please, impress and charm the very interlocutors 
    from whom he wanted support. Diplomats and journalists insist as much on his 
    charm as they do on his temper tantrums. The savior admired by his own as 
    he dragged them into madness, the Satan and Exterminating Angel feared and 
    hated by all others, Hitler led his people to a shameful defeat without precedent. 
    That his political and strategic ambitions have created a dividing line in 
    the history of this turbulent and tormented century is undeniable: there is 
    a before and an after. By the breadth of his crimes, which have attained a 
    quasiontological dimension, he surpasses all his predecessors: as a result 
    of Hitler, man is defined by what makes him Inhuman. With Hitler at the head 
    of a gigantic laboratory, life itself seems to have changed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How did this Austrian without title 
    or position manage to get himself elected head of a German nation renowned 
    for its civilizing mission? How to explain the success of his cheap demagogy 
    in the heart of a people so proud of having inherited the genius of a Wolfgang 
    von Goethe and an Immanuel Kant?...</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they 
      shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave 
      one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 
      2:43).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Few have inspired so much historical 
    and psychological research after their death. Even today, works on his enigmatic 
    personality and his cursed career are best sellers everywhere...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We think we know everything about 
    the nefarious forces that shaped his destiny: his unhappy childhood; his frustrated 
    adolescence; his artistic disappointments; his wound received on the front 
    during World War I; his taste for spectacle, his constant disdain for social 
    and military aristocracies; his relationship (and subsequent marriage) with 
    Eva Braun, who adored him...</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="+1">Seek out of the book of the Lord, and read: no one of 
      these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, 
      and his spirit it hath gathered them...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah 
      34:16).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the cult of the very Death he feared; 
    his lack of scruples with regard to his former comrades of the SA, whom he 
    ordered assassinated in 1934; his endless hatred of Jews, whose survival enraged 
    him--each and every phase of his official and private life has found its chroniclers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yet. There are, in all these 
    givens, elements that escape us. How did this unstable paranoid find it within 
    himself to impose gigantic hope as an immutable ideal that motivated his nation 
    almost until the end? Would he have come to power if Germany were not going 
    through endless economic crises, or if the winners in 1918 had not imposed 
    on it conditions that represented a national humiliation against which the 
    German patriotic fiber could only revolt?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We would be wrong to forget: Hitler 
    came to power in January 1933 by the most legitimate means. His Nationalist 
    Socialist Party won a majority in the parliamentary elections. The aging Field 
    Marshall Paul von Hindenburg had no choice but to allow him, at age 43, to 
    form the new government...and the beginning of the Third Reich, which, according 
    to Hitler, would last 1,000 YEARS. From that moment on events cascaded...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fact is that Hitler was beloved 
    by his people--not the military, at least not in the beginning, but by the 
    average Germans who pledged to him an affection, a tenderness and a fidelity 
    that bordered on the irrational. It was idolatry on a national scale. One 
    had to see the crowds that acclaimed him. And the women who were attracted 
    to him. And the young who in his presence went into ecstasy. Did they not 
    see the hateful mask that covered His Face? Did they not divine the catastrophe 
    he bore within himself?...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He wanted to swallow up Russia, 
    Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic countries to augment &quot;lebensraum:&quot; 
    Germany's vital space...</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And out of one of them came forth a Little Horn </font></i>(a 
    corporal)<font size="+1"> </font><i><font size="+1">which waxed exceedingly 
    great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it 
    cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon 
    them.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Yea, he magnified himself even to the Prince of the host, 
    and by him the Daily Sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his Sanctuary 
    was cast down.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And an host was given him against the Daily Sacrifice 
    </font></i>(the Mystery of Christ)<font size="+1"> </font><i><font size="+1">by 
    reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it 
    practised, and prospered.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said 
    unto that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning 
    the Daily Sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the 
    sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred 
    days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 
    8:9-14). </font></p>
  <p>(From the day that Hitler marched into Vienna in March of 1938, until the 
    allied invasion of Europe in 1944, there are just over <i>two thousand and 
    three hundred days</i>):</p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, 
    spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the Holy Place, (WHOSO READETH, 
    LET HIM UNDERSTAND):</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take 
    anything out of his house:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Neither let him which is in the field return back to take 
    his clothes.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And woe to them that are with child, and to them that 
    give suck in those days!</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But pray that your flight be not in the winter, neither 
    on the sabbath day;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since 
    the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And except those days be shortened, there should no flesh 
    be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But then why did he launch his 
    destructive war against London? Why did he declare war against the U.S.?...Why 
    did he mandate a policy of cruelty in the Soviet territories occupied by his 
    armies, when certain segments of the population there were ready to greet 
    them with flowers? And finally, why did he invest so much energy in his hatred 
    for the Jews? Why did the night trains that took them to their death have 
    priority over the military convoys that were taking badly needed troops to 
    the front? His dark obsession with the &quot;Jewish Question&quot; and its 
    &quot;Final Solution&quot; will be long remembered...In his testament, drafted 
    in an underground bunker just hours before his suicide in Berlin, Hitler returns 
    again to this hatred of the Jewish people that had never left him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But in the same testament he settles 
    his score with the German people. He wants them to be sacked, destroyed, reduced 
    to misery and shame for having failed him by denying him his glory. The former 
    corporal become commander in chief of all his armies and convinced of his 
    strategic and political genius was not prepared to recognize his own responsibility 
    for the defeat of his Reich.</font></p>
