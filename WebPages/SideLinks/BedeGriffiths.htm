    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">&quot;This is the challenge 
      to the Church today. The structure of doctrine and ritual and organization 
      which it inherited are no longer adequate to express the Divine Mystery, 
      like those of Israel in the time of Christ. The very principle of divine 
      life which originally created those structures is pressing for their transformation. 
      For the eternal Wisdom which remains ever the same has to manifest in the 
      ever-changing forms of history and society, of language, thought, culture 
      and social organization. The Church has a basic structure which derives 
      from the New Testament, alike of doctrine, of ritual and organization, but 
      the historical development of this structure is subject to continual change. 
      It is the Graeco-Roman structure which was built on the original Jewish 
      basis that is now breaking down. There is nothing in this, whether it is 
      dogmatic formulas, or its sacramental system or its hierarchical organization 
      that is not subject to change. We have to recover the original inspiration 
      which created the Church from the ruins of Judaism. The struggle between 
      the letter and the spirit, the law and grace, has to be renewed, as it has 
      continually in all religion. There is nothing which remains unchallenged, 
      no doctrine, no discipline, no law, no custom. What is demanded, as was 
      demanded of Israel, is nothing less than a death and resurrection. 'Destroy 
      this temple, and in Three days I will raise it up...But he spoke of the 
      temple of his body.'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It is this Body of 
      Christ which has to undergo this transformation, this temple of the eternal 
      Wisdom. From the beginning of the world this temple has been building--the 
      whole creation is the temple of God. From the beginning of history this 
      Body of Christ, which is the body of humanity, in which the divine Spirit 
      dwells, has been growing, age by age, Every religion has contributed to 
      the building of this temple, every human being is a member of this Body. 
      Christ is the cornerstone of this temple, the head of this Body, which is 
      the 'pleroma,' the 'fulness of him who fills all in all.' Now the Church 
      is this Body of Christ. It is the visible structure in which this mystery 
      of the divine life among men is being manifested. But it is not possible 
      to conceive this Church in isolation from the rest of the world. This Divine 
      Mystery is present everywhere in the hearts of all men. It is present in 
      every religion. The mystery of the Church, which is the mystery of the divine 
      life among men, has to be seen in the light of this universal revelation. 
      It is not sufficient to return to the Bible to discover the original source 
      of Christianity. The biblical revelation has to be seen in the context of 
      history as a stage in the manifestation of the Word of God, of the eternal 
      Wisdom, which has been present to the world from the beginning.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Return
