<div align="center">Caesar's Kingdom and God's Kingdom </div>
<p align="center">by Mark M. Mattison</p>
<p align="center"><i>Jesus was the most active resister known perhaps to history. 
  This was non violence par-excellence</i>. Gandhi</p>
<p align="left">FORWARD by Peter Doughty</p>
<p align="left">Mark Mattison, a nonviolent activist friend, is also a scholar 
  who beautifully summarizes in plain language the growing understanding of the 
  meaning of Jesus in today's biblical scholarship. Writers included those cited 
  in this work have been an essential part of my spiritual journey for years.</p>
<p align="left">Mark makes clear that the uncompromising, nonviolent love of Jesus 
  led him to proclaim a kingdom of justice--A CALL FOR A SOCIAL REVOLUTION--that 
  was opposed to the domination system of his day.</p>
<p align="left">He helps us break through the focus on private morality that has 
  allowed us to ignore the social explosiveness of Jesus words and actions. This 
  avoidance has left us comfortable in our social sins--domination, militarization, 
  greed, abandonment of the poor and demonization of enemies.</p>
<p align="left">It is thrilling to me to read how Jesus set about building the 
  Beloved Community--the reign of God here and now--in the midst of systematic 
  violence, and how his first disciples carried on that mission. I am grateful 
  to Mark and hope this book thrills you also.</p>
<p align="center">__________</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a book about the historical Jesus, the Mediterranean peasant who traveled 
  through THE VILLAGES OF GALILEE AND JUDEA and was ULTIMATELY EXECUTED BY THE 
  ROMAN AUTHORITIES. It is an attempt to emphasize one neglected aspect of Jesus' 
  mission, THE IMPERIAL WORLD IN WHICH HE LIVED AND WHICH HE STRUGGLED AGAINST. 
  I intend to argue that Jesus' message was not simply a spiritual message intended 
  for individuals, but that it was also a social and political message meant to 
  be lived out in the structures of society.</p>
<p>The first part of the book BROADLY OUTLINES THE IMPERIAL CONTEXT, and the second 
  part considers different aspects of Jesus' mission in light of that context. 
  The final chapter considers the early church in that light as well. It should 
  be stressed that what follows is a general overview. For a more detailed and 
  academic version of what follows, the reader is invited to read my manuscript, 
  &quot;The Jesus Revolution: A Socio-Political Reading of the Gospel.&quot; </p>
<p>In addition to the New Testament, I have drawn heavily on the work of the first-century 
  historian Josephus, particularly in the first half. Josephus provides important 
  information about the politics of Jesus' day. For many of my arguments, I am 
  indebted to some very gifted writers whose works appear in the bibliography.</p>
<p>Part One<br>
  The Kingdom of the World...</p>
<p>Chapter One<br>
  Caesar's Kingdom</p>
<p>The Gospel of Mark opens with the caption, &quot;THE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL 
  OF JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD&quot; (1:1, NASB).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p align="center"><b>...Thou art my son, This Day have I begotten thee...Psalm 
  2:7; Hebrews 12.</b></p>
<p>SEPARATED FROM MARK'S WORLD BY TIME, DISTANCE, AND CULTURE, it's difficult 
  to grasp how subversive this caption must have sounded in the first-century 
  Mediterranean world. THAT ONE SENTENCE IS FILLED WITH LOADED POLITICAL TERMS, 
  AND IT CARRIES AN OPEN CHALLENGE TO THE ONE MAN WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN PROCLAIMED 
  THE SON OF GOD: CAESAR.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>But exhort one another daily, WHILE IT IS CALLED TO DAY; lest any of you 
    be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</i></p>
  <p><i>For we are made partakers witjh Christ, IF WE HOLD THE BEGINNING OF OUR 
    CONFIDENCE STEADFAST UNTO THE END.</i></p>
  <p><i>While it is said, TO DAY IF YE WILL HEAR HIS VOICE, harden not your hearts 
    as in the day of provocation...</i><b>(Hebrews 3:13-15; Isaiah 66:6-9)</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;gospel&quot; itself is a political term. The Greek word means 
  &quot;good news.&quot; In the Roman empire, &quot;good news&quot; or &quot;glad 
  tidings&quot; about a &quot;son of god&quot; meant an announcement about the 
  birth, victory, or accession of an emperor. There was in fact no title too exalted 
  to ascribe to the emperor. He was &quot;patron,&quot; &quot;benefactor&quot; 
  (cp. Luke 22:25), &quot;savior,&quot; &quot;son of a god,&quot; and even &quot;god.&quot; 
  During the time that the Gospel of John was written, the emperor Domitian required 
  his subjects to address him as &quot;Lord and God.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The first emperor of the consolidated Roman territories, Octavian, was granted 
  the distinguished title of &quot;Augustus&quot; or &quot;Reverend&quot; by the 
  Senate. By defeating Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium, Octavian 
  had put an end to Rome's civil wars. As a result, he became the savior, the 
  one who established world peace, the pax Romana or Peace of Rome. He was &quot;the 
  Beginning of all things,&quot; the awaited one who ushered in a new age. AT 
  LEAST THAT WAS THE IMPERIAL PROPAGANDA, THE ROMAN GOSPEL. Many of the peoples 
  who were subjugated by Rome felt very differently. The peasants and artisans 
  of Galilee and Judea certainly felt differently. The author of one protest book, 
  4 Ezra, wrote:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>... you have held the world in subjection in great terror, and the whole 
    earth with harsh oppression, and you have lived so long in the world with 
    deceit; and you have not judged the earth with truth. You have persecuted 
    the meek and hurt the peacable, you have hated those who tell the truth, and 
    loved liars, and you have destroyed the dwellings of the fruitful, and torn 
    down the walls of those who did you no harm. And your insolence has reached 
    the Most High and your pride the Mighty One. ... Therefore you will surely 
    disappear ... so that the whole earth may be freed from your violence, and 
    be refreshed and relieved, and hope for the justice and mercy of him who made 
    her. (11:40-46).</p>
  <p><i>Enter not into the path of wicked men, and go not in the way of evil men.</i></p>
  <p><i>Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</i></p>
  <p><i>For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is 
    taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</i></p>
  <p><i>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</i></p>
  <p><i>BUT THE PATH OF THE JUST IS AS A SHINING LIGHT, THAT SHINETH MORE AND 
    MORE UNTO THE PERFECT DAY.</i></p>
  <p><i>The way of the wicked is in darkness, they know not at what they stumble...</i><b>(Proverbs 
    4:14-19)</b>.</p>

  <p><i>NOW is the judgment of this world: NOW shall the prince of This world

    while ye have the Light, lest Darkness come upon you: for he that walketh 
    in Darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</i></p>
  <p><i>While ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may be children 
    of Light...</i><b>(John 12:31-36)</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One doesn't have to look too far to find that type of criticism in the New 
  Testament. In the book of Revelation, Rome is depicted as A&quot;WOMAN DRUNK 
  WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SAINTS&quot; (17:6, KJV). In 1 Thessalonians 5:3, Paul 
  criticizes the pax Romans <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Apply the 
  words to America at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union)</font>: &quot;When 
  they shall say, Peace and security,' then sudden destruction will come upon 
  them as travail comes upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape&quot; 
  (KJV). But the New Testament's criticism of Rome is nowhere more challenging 
  THAN IN ITS CONSISTENT CONTRASTS BETWEEN CAESAR AND CHRIST.</p>
<p> Luke 2:1 states that Caesar Augustus ordered a census of &quot;all the inhabited 
  earth.&quot; Right from the beginning of Jesus' story, Luke has focused our 
  attention ON THE POWERFUL WORLD LEADER, THE LORD OF THE EARTH. Then he narrates 
  a story about Jesus being born in a humble manger (Luke 2:7). The real Lord 
  of the earth is not to be found on a mighty throne in Rome, but in a small town 
  on the fringe of the empire. Luke 2:14 proclaims peace on earth as a result 
  of Jesus' birth, not as a result of Caesar. Luke 2:11 indicates that it is not 
  Caesar but Jesus who is the long-awaited Lord and Savior.</p>
<p>Chapter Two<br>
  Politics and Poverty</p>
<p>According to Luke 2, Caesar is a sham <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(an 
  image)</font>. He's not the real thing. HIS RULE IS BASED NOT ON LOVE, BUT ON 
  FEAR AND OPPRESSION. HE BUILDS HIS EMPIRE ON THE BACKS OF OTHERS. </p>
<p>Now, how could the emperor effectively administer such a large empire? He couldn't. 
  The empire lacked the infrastructure and resources to actually run an empire 
  that surrounded the entire Mediterranean Sea. As a result, Rome often ruled 
  through client kings <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Governors)</font>. 
  Let the subjugated nation keep its own local rulers, the Romans reasoned. As 
  long as the rulers paid the necessary tribute to Rome and remained obedient 
  to the emperor, they were fine. Of course, that tribute came from the taxes 
  of the local residents. Herod the Great and his heirs, the client kings and 
  tetrarchs beholden to Rome, were free to line their own pockets and expand their 
  own holdings by collecting extra taxes and passing along the required amount 
  to Rome. Their clients in turn enriched themselves the same way, by skimming 
  off the proceeds of those underneath them in the pecking order. This economic 
  arrangement is reflected in Jesus' parable of the unmerciful servant in Matthew 
  18:23-35 and parable of the shrewd servant in Luke 16:1-8. By some estimates, 
  the total financial obligation forced onto the peasants through rent, taxes, 
  tribute, tolls, and tithes, was somewhere near forty percent of their incomes. 
  The burden was immense. As a result, by the time many peasants had fulfilled 
  their obligations to the government, they lacked the money to fulfill their 
  obligations to the temple.</p>
<p>Lacking the enforcement mechanism of Roman troops, temple authorites responded 
  to this inability through censure, arguing that those who were in dire financial 
  straights were unclean, and that the reason for their poverty and social marginalization 
  was that they had not fulfilled their obligations to God. WITH SO MUCH MONEY 
  FLOWING INTO THE JERUSALEM TEMPLE, it should not be surprising that the temple 
  was more than the nation's religious center. It was a formidable political and 
  economic stronghold as well. In fact it functioned as the national bank, providing 
  capital to aristocratic elites who used it to further their own fortunes.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg29a.gif" width="400" height="427"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Matthew, chapter 24 (KJV).</b></p>
<p>The way people became rich in Galilee and Judea was by seizing other peoples' 
  property. This created a downward social spiral for a large number of farmers. 
  WHEN THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS BECAME TOO GREAT, THEY HAD TO BORROW MONEY 
  FROM THE ARISTOCRATIC ELITES. When they were unable to pay their debts, their 
  lands were seized, and they were downgraded to tenants. When they were unable 
  to pay their rent, they were further downgraded to the status of day laborers, 
  finding temporary work on a day-to-day basis. Once they were unable to find 
  work, they became beggars. From the time they hit the street, they could expect 
  a short and brutal life. Jesus alluded to each of these stages in the downward 
  spiral in his parables about tenants, day laborers, and beggars.</p>
<p>HAD THE JUBILEE LAWS BEEN ENFORCED IN JESUS' DAY, THIS TERRIBLE POVERTY COULD 
  HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. According to these laws, debts had to be forgiven, land 
  returned, and slaves released, every fiftieth year. But by using a legal loophole 
  created by the rabbi Hillel, lenders were able to refuse making loans unless 
  debtors agreed to forego their Jubilee rights. THE PROMISED LAND QUICKLY BECAME 
  A LAND OF GREAT PROMISE FOR A TINY MAJORITY AND A LAND OF CRUSHING IMPOVERISHMENT 
  FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY.</p>
<p>IT WAS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT JESUS EMERGED PROCLAIMING THE BEGINNING OF 
  THE ULTIMATE JUBILEE (Luke 4:16-21) and undermining the temple's authority by 
  dispensing forgiveness of sin free of charge. He taught people to break the 
  cycle of debt in their own relationships (cf. Luke 6:34) by praying &quot;forgive 
  us our sins, as we have also forgiven everyone who is indebted to us&quot; (Luke 
  11:4, NASB). AND THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.</p>
<p>Chapter Three<br>
  The Resistance</p>
<p>Before considering the scope of Jesus' ministry it may be helpful to consider 
  one other aspect of Jesus' political and social context: The tradition of resistance 
  in Judea and Galilee. Within one generation of Jesus' execution, the people 
  of Judea and Galilee had been pushed to the breaking point. They rebelled against 
  Rome in a tragic war that ended with a crushing defeat and the destruction of 
  the temple in Jerusalem. There had also been protests and uprisings about a 
  generation before Jesus' ministry. Near the end of King Herod's reign, two scribes 
  named Judas and Matthias led a group of young men in an act of civil disobedience. 
  Their grievance was that HEROD HAD ERECTED AN IDOLATROUS GOLDEN EAGLE OVER THE 
  GATE OF THE TEMPLE. They tore the eagle down in an act of protest, and as a 
  result they were arrested and burned alive. Just three decades later, JESUS 
  WOULD ALSO PERFORM AN ACT OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IN THE TEMPLE WHICH WOULD LEAD 
  TO HIS ARREST AND EXECUTION, although his protest would be more penetrating.</p>
<p>Herod himself was an oppressive and ruthless tyrant. According to Matthew, 
  Herod ordered the execution of toddlers in Bethlehem because of a rumor about 
  the birth of the promised king of Israel (2:1-8,13-18). HE WOULD NOT TOLERATE 
  ANY THREAT TO HIS THRONE. According to Josephus, he killed three of his own 
  sons in order to protect it. HE BRUTALLY SQUASHED ALL DISSENT, SPIED ON CIVILIANS, 
  FORCED THEM TO TAKE AN OATH OF LOYALTY, AND RESTRICTED THEIR RIGHT TO ASSEMBLY.</p>
<p>According to Matthew, Jesus' family fled to Egypt and returned only after Herod's 
  death, which happened in 4 B.C.E. (2:19-21). However, upon hearing that Herod's 
  oldest son Archelaus was ruling Judea, JOSEPH TOOK HIS FAMILY NORTH INTO GALILEE 
  (vv. 22,23), which was ruled by Herod Antipas, another one of Herod's sons. 
  Herod's sons had themselves been involved in no little dispute over their father's 
  kingdom. Herod's desire had been that Archelaus would succeed him, but Archelaus 
  was inexperienced and the emperor was uncertain of his abilities. Shortly after 
  Herod had died, the people of Judea presented numerous grievances to Archelaus. 
  They asked for a reduction in their taxes, FOR THE RELEASE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Mumia and Leonard Peltier)</font>, 
  and for the punishment of those responsible for the executions of Judas and 
  Matthias. Initially Archelaus pretended to be sensitive to their concerns, but 
  he was in too big a hurry to go to Rome to make his case that he should be the 
  next king. Unable to negotiate peacefully with the protestors, he panicked and 
  dispatched his soldiers, killing thousands.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Archelaus and Antipas had gone to Rome to argue their cases 
  before Caesar...During that time, the procurator of Syria presumptuously seized 
  the palace in Jerusalem, ordered an accounting of the treasury resources, and 
  tried to take control of the fortresses. The result was even more violence. 
  One of Herod's cousins led two thousand former soldiers in revolt. Meanwhile, 
  MESSIANIC PRETENDERS EMERGED from both Galilee and Judea. Simon, one of Herod's 
  slaves, proclaimed himself king and burned the palace in Jericho. A large shepherd 
  named Athronges also claimed the throne, and along with his four brothers conducted 
  an effective guerilla warfare campaign. Meanwhile, Judas, son of Ezekias, stormed 
  Sepphoris in Galilee and confiscated all of the city's weapons. Each of these 
  uprisings was brutally suppressed. ALL THE INHABITANTS OF SEPPHORIS <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The 
  Ten Sephirot)</font> were sold into slavery and the city was burned. According 
  to Matthew, this was about the time that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus moved to a 
  small peasant village within walking distance of Sepphoris (Matt. 2:19-23). 
  After destroying Sepphoris, the Romans marched south to Jerusalem AND CRUCIFIED 
  ABOUT TWO THOUSAND REBELS <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1 Corinthians 
  2:1-8)</font>..</p>
<p>Caesar decided to make Archelaus not the king, but the ethnarch of Judea, Idumea, 
  and Samaria, with the potential of becoming a king if he ruled well. Herod Antipas 
  was given Galilee and Perea, and their brother Philip was given other territories. 
  Jesus' family had good reason to avoid Archelaus. His cruel reign didn't last 
  more than ten years. He ruled so poorly, in fact, Caesar banished him and turned 
  Judea into a subprovince of Rome under the authority of Quirinius, governor 
  of Syria (cf. Luke 2:2). From that time on the Judeans had to pay a heavy tribute 
  directly to Caesar, a vivid reminder of their status as an occupied people. 
  It was this issue that was later brought to Jesus by the authorities who wanted 
  to trap him (Mark 12:13-17 // Matt. 22:15-22 // Luke 20:20-26).</p>
<p>Chapter Four<br>
  Nonviolent Resistance</p>
<p>Not all forms of resistance against the imperial occupation were violent. There 
  were also nonviolent protests that are particularly noteworthy. The following 
  examples all come from the first-century historian Josephus. One of the most 
  intriguing tactics of nonviolent resistance happened at the beginning of Pontius 
  Pilate's administration in Judea. The year was 26. Jesus was to begin his ministry 
  shortly. Pilate moved his soldiers from Caesarea to Jerusalem for the winter. 
  As was their custom, they brought with them busts of the emperor on their army 
  standards. The Judeans, regarding this as an act of idolatry, rushed to Caesarea 
  and implored Pilate to have the busts removed. When he refused, they prostrated 
  themselves around his palace for five days. When Pilate called for the soldiers, 
  the protesters bared their necks, courageously indicating their willingness 
  to die rather than transgress God's law. Amazed at their zeal, Pilate called 
  off his soldiers and complied with their demands, moving the images from Jerusalem 
  to Caesarea.</p>
<p>Not long thereafter, Jesus taught crowds of peasants to turn the other cheek 
  when they were struck. Turning the other cheek is not exactly the same thing 
  as baring the neck, but as we will see later the similarity of the principle 
  is striking. An even more remarkable demonstration of nonviolent resistance 
  happened fifteen years later, during the reign of Caligula. Disturbed about 
  the fact that the Judeans had built no temples to honor him, Caligula sent Petronius 
  as legate of Syria to erect a statue of him in the Jerusalem temple. An idol 
  representing the emperor in the Jerusalem temple would clearly have been an 
  abomination. The people were naturally alarmed. Thousands turned out to meet 
  Petronius at Ptolemais, and even more met him at Tiberius. They assured him 
  that if he proceeded with the plan to erect the emperor's statue in the temple, 
  they would cease all agricultural production. THEY WERE IN EFFECT THREATENING 
  A MASS CAMPAIGN OF NONCOOPERATION. The result of such A WORK STOPPAGE would 
  have proved disastrous. The show of solidarity convinced Petronius to abandon 
  his mission. As it happened, the emperor died before the edict could be enforced 
  anyway. BUT THE REMARKABLE SUCCESS OF THE PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN OF NONCOOPERATION 
  CANNOT GO UNNOTICED.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy.</i></p>
  <p><i>SIX days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work.</i></p>
  <p><i>But the SEVENTH DAY is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: IN IT THOU SHALT 
    NOT DO ANY (SERVILE) WORK, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
    nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.</i></p>
  <p><i>For in Six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that 
    is in them, AND RESTED THE SEVENTH DAY: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath 
    Day, and hallowed it...</i><b>(Exodus 20:8-11; Hebrews 4:1-12).</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this event happened after the time of JESUS AND before the public mission 
  of PAUL <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(A great mystery...Galatians 
  1:11-16)</font>. This naturally raises the question of where the Christians 
  were in all of this. Were there Judean and Galilean Christians who joined their 
  compatriots in trying to prevent the erection of the abomination in the temple? 
  We do know that the earliest Christians continued to worship in the temple and 
  were as concerned about idolatry as any other law-abiding Judean, but ultimately 
  we can't know for sure to what extent Christians may have participated in the 
  anti-imperial protest.</p>
<p>Interestingly, another type of protest during this time involved the best known 
  Christian in Jerusalem: James, the brother of Jesus and leader of the Jerusalem 
  church. Just after the death of the Roman procurator in the year 62, Herod Agrippa 
  II appointed Ananus as high priest. Ananus, the son of the priest who together 
  with Caiaphas condemned Jesus, ILLEGALLY CONVENED THE SANHEDRIN TO TRY JAMES 
  AND SOME OTHER CHRISTIANS. He accused them of violating Moses' law and had them 
  stoned. The people of Jerusalem were horrified. They complained both to the 
  new procurator and to Herod Agrippa II. The procurator chastised Ananus, but 
  Agrippa responded to the complaints by deposing him from the priesthood. The 
  protests of the people were successful in removing an unjust priest from the 
  highest office.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; 
    and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be 
    holy </i>(subject to the ordinances of the Temple)<i>.</i></p>
  <p><i>Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; TWO LAMBS OF THE 
    FIRST YEAR DAY BY DAY CONTINUALLY.</i></p>
  <p><i>THE ONE LAMB THOU SHALT OFFER IN THE MORNING: AND THE OTHER LAMB THOU 
    SHALT OFFER AT EVEN...</i><b>(Exodus29:37-39; Numbers 28:1-4; 1 Kings 18:36-38; 
    Psalm 141:2)</b>.</p>
  <p><i>For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to 
    the image of His son, that he might be the Firstborn of many...</i></p>
  <p><i>As it is written FOR THY SAKE WE ARE KILLED ALL THE DAY LONG: WE ARE ACCOUNTED 
    AS SHEEP FOR THE SLAUGHTER...</i><b>(Romans 8:33-37; Isaiah 53:7)</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is so interesting about this episode is not only that it illustrates a 
  very basic tactic of nonviolent protest -- basically, petitioning the authorities 
  -- but also that it involved Jesus' disciples in Jerusalem. If the disciples 
  in Jerusalem were anywhere near as numerous as Acts suggests, I think it is 
  highly likely that at least some of the protesters were themselves followers 
  of Jesus.</p>
<p>Of course, not all nonviolent protests ended so ideally. One of the better 
  known prophetic protestors, JOHN THE BAPTIST, WAS EXECUTED SHORTLY AFTER THE 
  BEGINNING OF JESUS' CAREER. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2 Corinthians 
  12:1-5)</font>. John's message was one of imminent judgment in the land: &quot;INDEED 
  THE AXE IS ALREADY LAID TO THE ROOT OF THE TREES&quot; (Luke 3:9 // Matt. 3:10, 
  NASB). IT WAS AN APOCALYPTIC MESSAGE, AS POLITICAL AS IT WAS SPIRITUAL <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Ezekiel 
  31; Daniel 4; Matthew 7:13-20)</font>. John criticized Herod Antipas, not just 
  for illegally marrying his brother's wife Herodias, but also &quot;because of 
  all the wicked things which Herod had done&quot; (Luke 3:19, NASB). HEROD RESPONDED 
  PREDICTABLY BY HAVING JOHN ARRESTED (3:20).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Most things in the world, as long as their inner parts are hidden, stand 
    upright and live. If they are revealed they die, as is illustrated by the 
    visible man: as long as the intestines of a man are hidden, the man is alive. 
    When his intestines are exposed and come out of him, the man will die. SO 
    ALSO WITH A TREE: WHILE ITS ROOT IS HIDDEN IT SPROUTS AND GROWS. IF ITS ROOT 
    IS EXPOSED THE TREE DRIES UP. So it is with every birth that is in the world, 
    not only with the revealed but with the hidden. FOR SO LONG AS THE ROOT OF 
    WICKEDNESS IS HIDDEN, IT IS STRONG. BUT WHEN IT IS RECOGNIZED IT IS DISSOLVED. 
    WHEN IT IS REVEALED IT PERISHES. THAT IS WHY THE WORD SAYS, ALREADY THE AX 
    IS LAID AT THE ROOT OF THE TREES </i>(Mth. 3:10). <i>It will not merely cut--what 
    is cut sprouts again--BUT THE AX PENETRATES DEEPLY UNTIL IT BRINGS UP THE 
    ROOT. Jesus pulled out the root of the whole place, while others did it only 
    partially...</i><b>The Gospel of Philip</b><i>.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story of John's execution in the Gospels is well known: Herod promised 
  SALOME anything she wanted, and on behalf of her mother she demanded the head 
  of John the Baptist on a platter. It is important to remember, however, that 
  Herod wanted John dead anyway. According to Matthew 14:5, the only reason Herod 
  had not already killed him was because &quot;he feared the crowd, because they 
  regarded John as a prophet&quot; (NASB). According to Josephus, Herod executed 
  John because he feared that he could cause a full-fledged rebellion...</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Do you not know that the Head of Prophecy was cut off with John?</i></p>
  <p><i>I said, Lord, can it be possible to remove the head of prophecy?</i></p>
  <p><i>He said, When you come to know what Head means, and that prophecy issues 
    from the Head, then understand the saying of The Head was removed...</i><b>(The 
    Apocryphon of James; Psalm 74:5-9)</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he heard of John's death, Jesus retreated first to a secluded place (Mark 
  6:30-32 // Matt. 14:13), then to Bethsaida, just outside of Herod Antipas' jurisdiction 
  (Mark 6:45). Later, some Pharisees informed Jesus that Herod wanted to kill 
  him as well (Luke 13:31). JESUS' RESPONSE, AND HIS NONVIOLENT PROTESTS WHICH 
  LED TO HIS OWN MARTYRDOM, BECAME THE VERY FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1 
  Corinthians 3:12-17)</font>. </p>
<p>Chapter Five<br>
  Herod Antipas and Jesus</p>
<p>Two notable men in Galilee in the first half of the first century provide a 
  study in contrasts. The first was the tetrarch Herod Antipas, son of Herod the 
  Great. The second was Jesus of Nazareth, who as a toddler narrowly escaped death 
  at the hands of Herod the Great. Herod Antipas and Jesus of Nazareth were natural 
  antagonists. Jesus' messiahship was as much of a threat to Herod Antipas as 
  it was to Herod the Great. Jesus warned his disciples about Herod, saying &quot;Watch 
  out! BEWARE OF THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES AND THE LEAVEN OF HEROD&quot; (Mark 
  8:15, NASB). It may not be immediately apparent what the Pharisees and Herod 
  had in common. Indeed, the Pharisees belonged to a much lower social class, 
  were far more devout in their faith, and were far less accomodating to Rome. 
  But they were dependent upon the upper classes for what little authority they 
  had. It was because of their status as retainers to the aristocratic classes 
  that the Pharisees joined Herod's supporters, the Herodians, in antagonizing 
  Jesus (Mark 3:6; 12:13 // Matt. 12:16).</p>
<p>According to Luke 13:31-33:...some Pharisees approached , saying to Him, 'Go 
  away, leave here, for Herod wants to kill you.' And He said to them, 'Go and 
  tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, 
  AND THE THIRD DAY I SHALL BE PERFECTED. Nevertheless, I must journey on TODAY 
  and TOMORROW and THE NEXT DAY; FOR IT CANNOT BE THAT A PROPHET PERISH OUTSIDE 
  OF JERUSALEM&quot;...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p>. This passage conveys a great deal of information about Herod and Jesus. First, 
  it indicates that Herod wanted to kill him, which reinforces the point that 
  JESUS WAS A REAL POLITICAL THREAT TO THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER. Second, it indicates 
  Jesus' attitude toward both Herod and the Roman authority, as well as his evaluation 
  of his own mission. Jesus fully expected to be executed as a social prophet, 
  and as prophets tended to be killed in Jerusalem HE HAD TO GO THERE TO CONFRONT 
  THE AUTHORITIES. But there is another point that deserves to be explored here. 
  The first involves his immediate response to the Pharisees. In what way did 
  Jesus' healing people and casting out demons constitute a defiance of Herod? 
  His Beelzebub controversy with the Pharisees two chapters earlier in Luke's 
  Gospel provides a clue. There, Jesus had said that &quot;if I cast out demons 
  by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you&quot; (Luke 
  11:20, NASB). Exorcism -- the defeat of the powers which kept the people oppressed 
  -- was understood as a sign of the coming of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>But there is something else about Luke 11:20 that helps to illustrate the political 
  nature of that kingdom. The language of &quot;the finger of God&quot; comes 
  from the Exodus narrative (Ex. 8:19). The story of the liberation of the Hebrews 
  from slavery and oppression in Egypt was an eminently political story with very 
  concrete, social consequences. The finger of God bringing about a new Exodus 
  and a new kingdom was no less threatening to the power structures of Jesus' 
  own day.</p>
<p>Jesus' first recorded words of preaching in both Matthew's and Mark's Gospels 
  involve this political challenge: &quot;THE TIME IS FULFILLED, AND THE KINGDOM 
  OF GOD IS AT HAND; repent and believe in the gospel&quot; (Mark 1:15). In Luke's 
  Gospel, Jesus goes so far as to say, &quot;I must preach the kingdom of God 
  to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose&quot; (Luke 4:43, 
  NASB). What made this challenge most serious is that Jesus implied he was not 
  only the herald of this new kingdom, but its king. When he rode into Jerusalem 
  on a donkey during Passover, he knew exactly what he was doing. He was invoking 
  the memory of Zechariah 9:9 to indicate that Israel's true king had arrived 
  at long last.</p>
<p>Passover celebrated the liberation of Israel from a foreign oppressor in the 
  distant past. THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW KING DURING THIS FESTIVAL OF LIBERATION implied 
  a challenge to the Roman occupation, even though -- perhaps especially because 
  -- this challenge was being made by a very different kind of king. Just what 
  sort of king was Jesus?</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg39print.gif" width="532" height="753"></p>
<p>Chapter Six<br>
  Forgiving the Debt</p>
<p>Jesus may have presented himself as a king to the peasants of Galilee and Judea, 
  BUT HE WAS VERY CLEARLY DIFFERENT FROM THE KINGS THAT PRECEDED HIM.</p>
<p>There had been initial excitement over the establishment of the Hasmonean dynasty 
  following the Maccabean revolution of the second century B.C.E., but the Hasmoneans 
  had turned out not to be such great rulers after all. The Herodian dynasty lacked 
  even the validity of Hasmonean heritage, and the Herodians were only puppet-rulers 
  who answered directly to Rome. Whether Israel's rulers were natives or foreigners, 
  the oppression remained the same.</p>
<p>ECONOMIC OPPRESSION in Israel was not new. The prophets had condemned ECONOMIC 
  INJUSTICE frequently. Isaiah wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Lord enters into judgment with the elders and princes of His people,<br>
    &quot;It is you who have devoured the vineyard;<br>
    The plunder of the poor is in your houses.<br>
    What do you mean by crushing My people,<br>
    And grinding the face of the poor?&quot;<br>
    Declares the Lord God of hosts (3:14,15, NASB).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Amos had written:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, because you impose heavy rent on the poor<br>
    And exact a tribute of grain from them,<br>
    Though you have built houses of well-hewn stone,<br>
    Yet you will not live in them;<br>
    You have planted pleasant vineyards, yet you will not drink their wine (5:11, 
    NASB).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prophetic judgment is reflected in the Magnificat, in Luke 1:53. Mary 
  sings:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>He has brought down rulers from their thrones,<br>
    And has exalted those who were humble.<br>
    He has filled the hungry with good things;<br>
    And sent away the rich empty-handed (NASB).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus himself said, &quot;Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom 
  of God....But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in 
  full&quot; (Luke 6:20,24, NASB). It is difficult to deny that Jesus promised 
  liberation for the oppressed. This is reflected clearly in Luke's account of 
  Jesus' inaugural address in Nazareth. There, Jesus reads from Isaiah the prophet:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The spirit of the Lord is upon Me,<br>
    Because He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor.<br>
    He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to the captives,<br>
    And recovery of sight to the blind,<br>
    To set free those who are downtrodden,<br>
    To preach the Aceeptable Year of the Lord (Luke 4:18,19, quoting Isaiah 61:1,2a).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>THAT LAST PHRASE IS A REFERENCE TO THE JUBILEE PROVISION OF LEVITICUS 25:10. 
  Jubilee was an important part of Moses' law intended to prevent perpetual poverty. 
  It required that every fiftieth year indentured slaves be released, ancestral 
  property returned, and debts forgiven. Had this law been properly observed, 
  there would have been no poverty in Israel. But the aristocratic classes violated 
  the spirit of these laws by using a rabbinic loophole (called the prosbul) which 
  allowed them to refuse to give loans unless debtors waived their Jubilee rights.</p>
<p>THE APPLICATION OF ISAIAH 61:2 TO JESUS MINISTRY IMPLIES NOT ONLY THAT JESUS 
  CALLED THE NATION TO REPENT AND OBEY THE JUBILEE, IT IMPLIES ALSO THAT THE FINAL 
  JUBILEE HAD ARRIVED. THE TIME HAD COME TO PUT AWAY THE OLD ORDER and to begin 
  living according to grace instead of debt. IT IMPLIED THAT ISRAEL'S DE FACTO 
  EXILE UNDER FOREIGN OPPRESSORS WAS OVER. GOD'S KINGDOM WAS COMING AT LONG LAST; 
  Israel's debt of sin had been forgiven and it was time to relate to one another 
  on that basis, to pray &quot;forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone 
  who is indebted to us&quot; (Luke 11:4).</p>
<p>THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEW ORDER CLEARLY THREATENED THE EXISTING ORDER. It undermined 
  completely the Jerusalem temple, WHICH WAS NOT ONLY THE NATION'S RELIGIOUS CENTER 
  BUT A FORMIDABLE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STRONGHOLD AS WELL. With offerings, 
  double tithes, and taxes flowing into the temple from all directions, it quickly 
  became the nation's most treasured resource, doubling as the national bank for 
  the elite classes. The temple authorities, in fact, had a divine monopoly. Divine 
  forgiveness of sin could be obtained only through the temple services, which 
  were not cheap. This fact highlights the subversive nature of Jesus' willingness 
  to dispense divine forgiveness of sin free of charge. Some scribes criticized 
  Jesus, asking &quot;Why does this man speak this way? He is blaspheming; who 
  can forgive sins but God alone?&quot; (Mark 2:5). Though it may be tempting 
  to regard this as a controversy about the person of Christ and whether he was 
  God, IN FACT THE ISSUE WAS ABOUT AUTHORITY. The temple ceremonies were the officially 
  authorized media for the forgiveness of sins. Did Jesus have authority from 
  God to forgive sin? Jesus said yes, the authorities said no. And it is little 
  wonder. FORGIVENESS THROUGH THE NEW MESSIAH MEANT THAT ISRAEL'S EXILE WAS ENDING 
  AND GOD WAS DWELLING WITH HIS PEOPLE. The temple was no longer necessary. That 
  was a threat.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship 
    hath righteousness with unrighteousness? AND WHAT COMMUNION HATH LIGHT WITH 
    DARKNESS?</i></p>
  <p><i>And what concord hath Christ with Be'li-al? or what part hath he that 
    believeth with an infidel?</i></p>
  <p><i>And what agreement hath the Temple of God with idols? FOR YE ARE THE TEMPLE 
    OF THE LIVING GOD, AS GOD HATH SAID, I WILL DWELL IN THEM, AND WALK IN THEM; 
    and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</i></p>
  <p><i>WHEREFORE COME OUT FROM AMONG THEM, AND BE YE SEPARATE, saith the Lord, 
    and touch not the unclean thing: and I will receive you,</i></p>
  <p><i>And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, 
    saith the Lord Almighty...</i><b>(2 Corinthians 6:14-18; Leviticus 26:11,12)</b>.</p>
  <p><i>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE, 
    THAT YE BE NOT PARTAKERS OF HER SINS, AND THAT YE RECEIVE NOT OF HER PLAGUES.</i></p>
  <p><i>FOR HER (America's) SINS HAVE REACHED UNTO HEAVEN, AND GOD HATH REMEMBERED 
    HER INIQUITIES...</i><b>(Revelation 18:4,5; Hebrews 12:25-29)</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus also undermined the temple economy by arguing against the validity of 
  the temple tax. He said to Peter, &quot;What do you think, Simon? From whom 
  do the kings of the earth collect customs or poll-tax, from their sons or from 
  strangers?&quot; When Peter answered, &quot;From strangers,&quot; Jesus replied, 
  &quot;Consequently the sons are exempt&quot; (Matt. 17:25,26).</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>(KJV)<i> THEN ARE THE CHILDREN FREE. </i> </p>
  <p>The difference is critical. One implies that the children are only free from 
    the temple tax. The other implies that the children are FREE altogether, in 
    every aspect of their personal and communal lives, and especially in, or from, 
    their relationship to the governments of the earth...<b>( John 8:31-36; Romans 
    6:13; Ephesians 6:10-19; Galatians 5:1; 1 Peter 2:16; 1 Pet.4:11-16...KJV)</b>. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The temple authorities argued that since God is like a king, he should be entitled 
  to a temple tax from his subjects. Jesus subverted the point of the metaphor 
  by emphasizing not the idea of God as king but God as a parent. Children don't 
  pay taxes to their parents. Why then should the children of God pay taxes to 
  the temple? It wasn't necessary. Verse 27 has always been a perplexing verse. 
  After having undermined the whole idea of paying the temple tax, why would Jesus 
  instruct Peter to obtain the money in a miraculous way and then go ahead and 
  pay it? The answer is not very clear, but one possibility is that a strong point 
  is being made. Most peasants couldn't afford to meet their temple obligations 
  on top of their other commitments. After paying taxes, tolls, tribute, and rent, 
  the peasants were expected to pay a double tithe, voluntary offerings, and a 
  tax to the temple as well. The average peasant just couldn't afford it. Perhaps 
  the point of verse 27 is that it would take a miracle to enable the average 
  peasants to pay these taxes, as they were simply unable to do it.</p>

    not come yet)<i>, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish

    a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee...</i><b>(Matthew

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE STORY OF JONAH</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Yom Kippur...when the sun's 
    rays begin to slant and heavenly doors are starting to close, we read the 
    story of Jonah--the story of a prophet who tried to run away from God and 
    of a Great City that was saved through repentance....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Nineveh had sinned greatly,&quot; 
    G-d said to Jonah. &quot;Its crimes of murder, robbery and dishonesty have 
    now reached untold proportions. Therefore I bid you to go to Nineveh and announce 
    its destruction.&quot; Jonah thought: &quot;Twice before, G-d sent me to threaten 
    Jerusalem and Israel with the same fate. But the people there repented and 
    the city still stands. They called me the lying prophet. If I fare the same 
    way in Nineveh, I'll end up despised both at home and abroad. No! I will not 
    go there to carry out God's command. I'll hide among the heathen where God's 
    spirit doesn't dwell.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jonah then went to the seashore, 
    and asked the sailors, &quot;When does the next ship leave for Tarshish?&quot; 
    A ship for Tarshish left only the day before yesterday, they told him. &quot;You 
    will have to wait for its return.&quot; Jonah felt very sad, But G-d brought 
    about a string wind so that the ship that was on its way to Tarshish was forced 
    back to port. &quot;Now I am sure that my plan will be successful!&quot; When 
    the ship started out again, Jonah was on board, bound for Tarshish. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the course of the voyage a Great 
    Storm arose. It tossed the ship about and threatened to crush it. But the 
    people on board saw with amazement that the other ships at sea were continuing 
    serenely on their way, undisturbed by the storm. How could that be?...&quot;The 
    gods rage against us alone!&quot; cried the frightened sailors and passengers. 
    &quot;The people on this ship belong to the Seventy separate Nations. Let 
    every man pray to his god to come to our aid.&quot; Each man began praying 
    to his god but no help came. During all of this Jonah SLEPT soundly, unaware 
    of what was going on.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;How can you sleep and not 
    pray at a time when we are in danger of perishing?&quot; the captain cried, 
    WAKING HIM. &quot;To what nation do you belong?&quot; &quot;I am a Jew,&quot; 
    answered Jonah. &quot;A Jew!&quot; exclaimed the captain. &quot;Then you're 
    one of those who worship the Mighty God about whom I've heard so much. Pray 
    to Him. Perhaps He'll cause a miracle to happen.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That cannot happen because 
    God is angry with me,&quot; replied Jonah. The storm will not subside until 
    you have cast me into the sea.&quot; But the others would not believe his 
    words. They cast lots to discover the sinner among them and it was Jonah who 
    drew the fatal mark. &quot;Now we are convinced that the Jew's words were 
    true,&quot; they said. &quot;Let him be cast into the sea so that we may not 
    die on account of one man!&quot;...(After lowering him into the sea for the 
    Third Time)...They did not pull Jonah back up again and he sank into the sea.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JONAH AND THE FISH</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Jonah sank into 
    the sea a Great Fish came and swallowed him. Nonetheless the prophet of God 
    remained unharmed and was without fear, for overhead, in the inside of the 
    Fish, hung a Stone that shone as bright as the Sun. This made it easy for 
    Jonah to look through the eyes of the Great Fish as through two windows. He 
    thus could see everything that went on in the sea. Suddenly the Fish began 
    to tremble and cried out, &quot;I'm sorry for you Jonah, your end is near!&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Why so?&quot; 
    asked Jonah. &quot;What do see that's so frightening?&quot; &quot;Leviathan,

    how you live,&quot; said Jonah to the king of the Sea creatures. &quot;What 
    concern is it of yours?&quot; asked Leviathan. &quot;You are the creature 
    that God will some day serve up as nourishment to the pious,&quot; answered 
    Jonah. When Leviathan heard this he grew frightened and hurried away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Since I have protected you,&quot; 
    Jonah said to the Fish, &quot;show me all the interesting places around here.&quot; 
    &quot;With pleasure,&quot; answered the Fish, &quot;but first tell me what 
    it was that you and Leviathan spoke about.&quot; Jonah consented and while 
    he told him about it, the Fish swam with him to the bottom of the sea. He 
    showed him the path where the people of Israel crossed the sea, when they 
    came out of Egypt. He saw the Foundation of the earth, the deep abyss (of 
    God's Consciousness), the portals of Gehennom, the Rock of Ages upon which 
    the sons of Korah were praying...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now Leviathan is hungry and 
    snorts with rage,&quot; replied the Fish. &quot;His breath is so hot that 
    it consumes both the air and the water.&quot; Jonah remained inside the Fish 
    THREE DAYS...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jonah was suddenly filled with 
    terror. What if the Fish had decided to devour him:? In his anguish he started 
    to pray: &quot;Almighty God! Even when I am in the depths of the sea, You 
    abide with me and watch over me. You are the ruler of the Universe and your 
    Throne is in heaven and on earth. I call on you therefore to aid me and lead 
    me out of the depths of the sea to dry land!&quot; And God graciously listened

    go in peace.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The city of Nineveh was tremendous

    an average of 12 people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jonah visited the market places

</blockquote>
<p>Jesus undermined the temple both by dispensing divine forgiveness of sin free 
  of charge and by criticizing the temple tax. But that's not all. His most glaring 
  challenge followed his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Shortly after entering 
  the city, he proceeded to the temple WHERE HE PERFORMED THE MOST VISIBLE ACT 
  OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. He proclaimed: &quot;IS IT NOT WRITTEN, MY HOUSE SHALL 
  BE CALLED OF ALL NATIONS THE HOUSE OF PRAYER? BUT YE HAVE MADE IT A DEN OF THIEVES. 
  (Mark 11:17 // Matt. 21:13 // Luke 19:46). Jesus' point could not have been 
  more clear. The temple authorities were like bandits, robbing the people blind 
  and retreating back to their den. This was not simply, as it is often portrayed, 
  a &quot;cleansing&quot; of the temple. IT WAS A CHALLENGE TO THE WHOLE TEMPLE 
  SYSTEM. LATER THAT WEEK JESUS PREDICTED THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT SAME TEMPLE.</p>
<p>So Jesus emerged as a new liberator and king, but not the type of king who 
  would simply replace one dictatorship with another. HE PROMISED LIBERATION FROM 
  ECONOMIC OPPRESSION AS WELL. BUT WHAT TYPE OF KINGDOM DID HE PROPOSE TO REPLACE 
  THE EXISTING SYSTEM WITH?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, 
    which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other 
    people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it 
    shall stand forever...</i><b>(Daniel 2:44)</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chapter Seven<br>
  Counter-Kingdom</p>
<p>There was a distinctive social dimension to the counter-kingdom that Jesus 
  began to build. His message was not only a message for individuals, challenging 
  people to confess their personal sins and get their hearts right. It was also 
  a message for whole communities (cf. Luke 10:13-15 // Matt. 11:20-23), and a 
  challenge to become part of a renewed community.</p>
<p>Jesus' movement was a renewal movement. He described it as a mission &quot;to 
  the lost sheep of the house of Israel&quot; (Matt. 10:6; 15:24). He chose twelve 
  disciples, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel (cf. Luke 22:30 // Matt. 
  19:28). He encouraged the development of &quot;fictive kinship networks,&quot; 
  that is, groups of people who relate to one another as if they are in fact brothers 
  and sisters. He encouraged, as it were, ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS TO THE IMPERIAL 
  ORDER, telling his followers to resolve disputes among themselves instead of 
  going to the authorities (cf. Luke 12:57-59 // Matt. 5:25,26; Luke 17:2,3 // 
  Matt. 18:15-17; cp. 1 Cor. 6:1-8).</p>
<p>What was the basis of authority and leadership in this renewal movement? Jesus 
  described the pattern to his disciples in Mark 10:42,43: You know that those 
  who are regarded as rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their high 
  officials exercise authority over them. IT SHALL NOT BE SO AMONG YOU. Instead, 
  anyone who wants to become great among you must be your servant. THIS SAYING 
  CARRIES AN ANTI-IMPERIAL POLEMIC. &quot;Those who are regarded as rulers of 
  the nations&quot; or &quot;the Gentiles&quot; are the Romans. Luke even adds, 
  &quot;those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors&quot; 
  (Luke 22:25, NIV). &quot;Benefactor,&quot; as we have seen, was one of the titles 
  of the Roman emperor. However, THE TRUE LEADER of the disciples WILL BE THEIR 
  SERVANT. Jesus goes on to imply that he is their true leader specifically because 
  he is their true servant, willing not to be served but to serve, even to die 
  for their sakes (Mark 10:45). CAESAR TIBERIUS <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The 
  American President)</font> WOULD BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE OTHERS TO KEEP HIS 
  THRONE, BUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO DIE FOR HIS SUBJECTS <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(John 
  10:1-18)</font>. Messiah Jesus was the ultimate servant.</p>
<p>How did Jesus' revolutionary renewal movement look to the authorities who collaborated 
  with the occupation government? Jesus himself told parables to illustrate what 
  his movement was like in relation to the existing power structures. He compared 
  the kingdom of his proclamation to the spread of a mustard plant (Mark 4:30-32 
  // Matt. 13:31,32 // Luke 13:18,19). He said: How shall we picture the kingdom 
  of God, or by what parable shall we present it? It is like a mustard seed, which, 
  when sown upon the soil, though it is smaller than all the seeds that are upon 
  the soil, yet when it is sown, grows up and becomes larger than all the garden 
  plants and forms large branches; so that the birds of the air can nest under 
  its shade (Mark 4:30-32 // Matt. 13:31,32 // Luke 13:18,19, NASB).</p>
<p>The statement about &quot;the birds of the air&quot; ties the parable back 
  to Ezekiel 17:23, 31:6, and Daniel 4:12, emphasizing the concrete political 
  nature of the kingdom. Matthew and Luke describe the mustard plant as a &quot;tree,&quot; 
  probably to reinforce the allusion to Ezekiel and Daniel, but Mark's version 
  is more accurate horticulturally since the mustard plant is not so much a tree 
  as a shrub, and a nasty shrub at that. In fact it is a dreaded weed, partly 
  because it is so hard to control. It rapidly takes over the whole garden and 
  violates the principle of separating different types of seed as prescribed in 
  Leviticus 19:19. TO THOSE IN POWER, THE COUNTER-CULTURAL KINGDOM OF GOD LOOKED 
  LIKE THE SPREAD OF A DANGEROUS WEED!</p>
<p>Another parable Jesus told communicates much the same point: And again He said, 
  &quot;To what shall I compare the kingdom of God? It is like leaven, which a 
  woman took and hid IN THREE MEASURES OF MEAL, until it was all leavened&quot; 
  (Luke 13:20,21 // Matt. 13:33; Genesis 18:1-6). There are three elements of 
  this parable that are particularly noteworthy. The first is the fact that the 
  woman &quot;hid&quot; the leaven in the dough. That implies secrecy. IF GOD'S 
  KINGDOM IS LIKE SOMETHING (THAT WAS) HIDDEN IN A BATCH OF DOUGH, THEN IT IS 
  A SUBVERSIVE PRESENCE. The second is the fact that leaven was an &quot;unclean&quot; 
  ingredient, a symbol of sin or corruption. JESUS VIOLATED MANY PURITY LAWS AND 
  ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THE WRONG PEOPLE, the unclean rabble. The third is the fact 
  that three <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MEASURES</font> of dough 
  is a very large amount. That equals 50 pounds of flour, enough to make cakes 
  for 100 people. IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT SUCH A LARGE BATCH OF DOUGH WAS MEANT 
  TO REPRESENT THE (ENTIRE) NATION.</p>
<p>The point of the parable, then, is that the kingdom of Jesus' proclamation 
  spreads secretly, like wildfire, tearing down all social barriers and contaminating 
  the whole nation. Little wonder that Jesus was brought to Pilate with the charge, 
  &quot;HE STIRS UP THE PEOPLE, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee, 
  EVEN AS FAR AS THIS PLACE&quot; (Luke 23:5, NASB).</p>
<p>The specific charges brought against Jesus are described in Luke 23:2: And 
  they began to accuse Him, saying, &quot;We found this man misleading our nation 
  and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, 
  a King.&quot; From the standpoint of the authorities, Jesus certainly was misleading 
  the nation. As we have seen, his teachings undermined the authority of not only 
  the imperial occupation and its client rulers, but the temple authorities as 
  well. HE WAS CLEARLY A THREATTO THE STATUS QUO. We have also considered the 
  point that Jesus presented himself to the people of Jerusalem as Christ, the 
  promised king, when he rode into Jerusalem during Passover on a donkey. There 
  is substantial truth behind these charges.</p>
<p>What, then, of the charge that Jesus forbade the paying of taxes to Caesar? 
  Jesus' statement, &quot;RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S, AND TO 
  GOD THE THINGS THAT ARE GOD'S&quot;, is widely interpreted to mean that Jesus 
  actually supported the paying of tribute to Caesar. But that type of statement 
  would hardly have amazed Jesus' opponents, as it is portrayed as doing (Mark 
  12:17). The context of that statement is a debate in which the Pharisees and 
  Herodians were trying to trap Jesus (Mark 12:13). Their question, &quot;Is it 
  lawful to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?&quot; was particularly clever because 
  either a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot; answer would land Jesus in trouble. 
  If he had said &quot;no,&quot; he could have been arrested on the spot. If he 
  had said &quot;yes,&quot; he would have looked like a collaborator. Jesus was 
  being asked either to openly declare his opposition to Caesar or to lie about 
  it. He did neither.</p>
<p>What was Jesus' response? First, he asked his critics to show him a denarius 
  (Mark 12:15). This automatically shifted the focus from Jesus to his critics. 
  He did not have a denarius on him, whereas his critics did. They, not him, were 
  therefore identified with the denarius. Second, he asked whose image and inscription 
  was on the denarius (Mark 12:16 pars.). That question carried with it an implicit 
  criticism. Graven images were forbidden by the Ten Commandments, and yet here 
  was a coin with a graven image of the emperor. The inscription of the denarius 
  of this period read, &quot;Tiberius Caesar, Augustus, son of the divine Augustus.&quot; 
  This coin, in other words, was an idol.</p>
<p>Jesus' final statement, &quot;Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's 
  and to God the things that are God's,&quot; needs to be considered carefully. 
  What things are God's? According to the Scriptures, God owns the cattle on a 
  thousand hills (Psa. 50:10) -- in a word, everything. What then does that really 
  leave for Caesar? Nothing except for all those little minted idols, which may 
  be returned to him immediately and taken out of the land. Jesus' response was 
  therefore a covert rejection of Roman authority which nevertheless was ambiguous 
  enough to stave off the threat of imminent arrest. After all, Jesus' reply was 
  technically acceptable, even though his real meaning lay not far from the surface. 
  This implied meaning was not entirely lost on his accusers as it emerged as 
  evidence against him when he was presented to the local Roman authority.</p>
<p>But if Jesus believed that Rome had no right to rule over Judea and Galilee, 
  how did he propose to liberate the nation? After all, he had already rejected 
  the power politics of the world. He had no army <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Well

  simply to take the place of Herod Antipas. Just what type of revolution was 
  Jesus about?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Chapter Eight<br>
  A Different Kind of Revolution</p>
<p>It is clear what type of revolution Jesus was not interested in creating. In 
  Gethsemane, after Peter had attacked the high priest's servant with a sword, 
  Jesus said, &quot;Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take 
  up the sword shall perish by the sword&quot; (Matt. 26:52). It is clear that 
  Jesus rejected the path of violence. Instead, Jesus impressed upon his followers 
  the importance of loving all people, including the enemy (Matt. 5:43). This 
  teaching is truly revolutionary. God's kingdom would not arrive through the 
  shedding of blood; Israel had &quot;been there, done that.&quot; Previous uprisings 
  had simply replaced one type of dictatorship with another. God's people would 
  not find liberation through the sword. That path led to even more blood. Unconditional 
  love was the path to true liberation.</p>
<p>But what, exactly, did this mean? Consider a more concrete teaching. A few 
  verses earlier, Jesus repealed the law of retaliation, saying, &quot;You have 
  heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, 
  Do not resist an evil person&quot; (Matt. 5:38,39). Unfortunately, this translation 
  obscures Jesus' point. Did Jesus really say &quot;do not resist evil?&quot; 
  That would be inconsistent with his own practice. Jesus resisted evil at every 
  point. He did not hesitate to confront hypocrisy or greed, and he never hesitated 
  to condemn injustice. What, then, did he mean? The key to unlocking this apparent 
  contradiction lies in our translation of the Greek word for &quot;resist,&quot; 
  antistenai. This was a technical term from the Greek Old Testament that denoted 
  warfare or violent resistance. Keeping this in mind, the Scholar's Version more 
  accurately reads, &quot;Don't react violently against the one who is evil.&quot; 
  Jesus' followers were indeed to resist evil, but not in a violent way. They 
  were to resist in a nonviolent way instead.</p>
<p>This principle is described in three illustrations which follow. First, Jesus 
  says, &quot;whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also&quot; 
  (v. 5:39). This statement has long been misunderstood as an example of passive 
  nonresistance. But this could hardly have been Jesus' meaning. When he was unjustly 
  struck by the high priest's officer, Jesus did not passively cower. Instead, 
  he talked back and challenged him (John 18:22,23). What, then, did he mean by 
  &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;? A closer consideration of the text will reveal 
  that it does not describe passive nonresistance, but an active form of nonviolent 
  resistance instead. Jesus is clearly not describing the blow of a closed fist, 
  but a backhanded slap. This is apparent from the fact that Jesus specifies the 
  right cheek. It would be very difficult for a right-handed person to punch someone 
  in the right cheek. To strike someone on the right cheek, a right-handed person 
  would need to swing his or her right hand in an arc from left to right, thereby 
  striking the victim on the right cheek.</p>
<p>In that culture, this was not the type of blow delivered by an equal. Instead, 
  it was the type of blow delivered by a superior to an inferior, by a master 
  to a slave, by a soldier to a peasant. It was the type of blow intended to put 
  someone back into his or her place. By turning the other cheek, however, the 
  victim would make it very difficult for the offender to strike in quite that 
  same way again. It implied standing up to the oppressor, sending the nonverbal 
  message that no matter what the oppressor does, he or she will not break the 
  spirit of the aggrieved party. There will be no cowering before injustice, only 
  the power of nonviolent resistance.</p>
<p>The next example implies a juridicial setting: &quot;And if someone wants to 
  sue you, and take your shirt, let him have your coat also&quot; (5:40). Luke 
  reverses the order, writing &quot;whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold 
  your shirt from him either&quot; (Luke 6:29). Like the statement about turning 
  the other cheek, this statement has also been widely misunderstood. To understand 
  the full impact of this example, consider the fact that people of that day only 
  wore two pieces of clothing: A long tunic or shirt that covered the body, and 
  an outer garment or cloak. For the poorest of the poor, that outer cloak doubled 
  as a sleeping bag. For that reason, Moses' law forbade creditors from permanently 
  taking away their cloaks (Deut. 24:10-13).</p>
<p>Now consider the court scene described by Jesus. The creditor sues the peasant 
  and takes away his cloak. The peasant strips off his tunic as well and hands 
  it over. At this point, the debtor is stark naked -- as if to say, &quot;You're 
  going to take my coat? Okay, have my shirt as well. Now I don't have any clothes 
  at all. Are you happy?&quot; It is yet another form of protest, an object lesson 
  in oppression.</p>
<p>In Jesus' own case, nonviolent resistance and noncooperation meant his own 
  death. And not just any death -- death on a cross, a grueling form of punishment 
  reserved for revolutionaries and enemies of the state. BUT IT WAS PRECISELY 
  THAT DEATH THAT EXPOSED EVIL AND SIN FOR WHAT IT WAS AND EMPOWERED THE SOCIAL 
  REVOLUTION KNOWN AS THE EARLY CHURCH. Through his death on the cross and victory 
  over death, Jesus overcame evil and oppression. His spiritually empowered disciples 
  followed the lead of their king and continued to liberate their people in the 
  fullest sense.</p>
<p>Chapter Nine<br>
  Jesus' Disciples</p>
<p>How faithful were Jesus' first followers, the early Christians of the first 
  century? Did they carry on Jesus' tradition of social revolution and resisting 
  evil with love, or did they instead spiritualize his message in favor of the 
  imperial status quo? Considering the shape of the book of Acts may help to answer 
  some of these questions. The first thing that can be said about the churches 
  in Acts is that they were truly alternative communities whose very existence 
  challenged the ways of the imperial world. By proclaiming the lordship of Jesus, 
  they denied the lordship of Caesar. When Peter boldly addressed the &quot;Rulers 
  and elders of the people&quot; (Acts 4:8) and proclaimed that &quot;there is 
  salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been 
  given among men, by which we must be saved&quot; (v. 12), he was undermining 
  Rome's imperial propaganda; for whatever else that assertion may have meant, 
  it denied the imperial claim that Caesar was savior of the world.</p>
<p>This assertion was followed by civil disobedience, as the disciples refused 
  to remain silent about their rival gospel (4:18-20; 5:28,29). In a prayer meeting 
  afterward, according to Luke, the disciples considered the implications of the 
  the fact that Jesus was opposed both by Herod Antipas, the tetrarch who answered 
  directly to Rome, and by Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect (4:27). They also 
  prayed about &quot;signs and wonders&quot; (v. 30), a clear allusion to the 
  liberation of Israel from Egypt (cf. Ex. 7:3).</p>
<p>The very outline of Acts itself contains a revolutionary message. The book 
  may be divided into two parts. The first part, extending from the beginning 
  through chapter 12, chronicles the history of the church in Israel and focuses 
  on Peter. It culminates in Peter's imprisonment under Herod Agrippa I, the last 
  Herodian king who ruled all of Israel. The second part, extending from chapter 
  13 through the end of the book, chronicles the spread of the church in the empire 
  at large and focuses on Paul. It culminates in Paul's imprisonment under Caesar 
  Nero, THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD.</p>
<p>Here is the truly revolutionary part of that observation. In chapter 12, Peter 
  is liberated from jail while the king of Israel, Herod Agrippa I, is struck 
  down in divine judgment. Though chapter 28 does not narrate the end of Paul 
  or of Nero, we do know that Nero came to an untimely end as well. What do Herod 
  Agrippa I and Nero have in common? Both were powerful rulers: One the ruler 
  of Israel, the other the ruler of the whole empire. In addition, both arrogated 
  to themselves divine honors. (Imperialists have always been tempted to claim 
  divine sanction for their regimes.) As a result, they were both judged. A MOVEMENT 
  WHOSE GOD COULD DEPOSE KINGS AND EMPERORS WAS TRULY A DANGEROUS AND REVOLUTIONARY 
  MOVEMENT.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Jesus ministered among impoverished peasants who struggled to survive in a 
  world dominated by an imperial foreign oppressor. Not only were Jesus' people 
  oppressed by a foreign government, they were oppressed by their own leaders 
  as well. Even the temple system contributed to their poverty.</p>
<p>JESUS PROCLAIMED THE ADVENT OF A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF KINGDOM, A KINGDOM 
  BASED ON LOVE AND NONVIOLENCE. He undermined the legitimacy of both the royal 
  authorities and the temple authorities. HIS MOVEMENT WAS A SUBVERSIVE, SOCIAL 
  REVOLUTION, A MOVEMENT THAT THREATENED THE IMPERIAL STATUS QUO. AS A RESULT 
  HE WAS EXECUTED AS AN ENEMY OF THE STATE. Paradoxically, however, the occasion 
  of his crucifixion became the very instrument that exposed and overcame evil 
  and injustice.</p>
<p>AS MODERN-DAY FOLLOWERS OF JESUS, CAN WE PERCEIVE THE THREAT OF IMPERIAL OPPRESSION 
  IN THE WORLD TODAY? DO WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT STRUCTURAL INJUSTICE, 
  TO TAKE RULING AUTHORITIES TO TASK FOR OPPRESSING THE POOR? Do we feel any obligation 
  to minister to those who are oppressed? I submit that the church has a responsibility 
  to work for justice, a responsibility enjoined upon her by Jesus himself.</p>
