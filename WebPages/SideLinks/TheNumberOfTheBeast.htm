</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">How do we arrive at this calculation of the number Six hundred 
  Sixty and Six? We do so step by step. We must first of all understand the implications 
  of the number Six, and its relationship not only to this text in the book of 
  Revelation but to the other sefiroth, or numbers, on the sacred Oracle. It is 
  this access to the oracles in our time which allows us to arrive at our present 
  conclusions. (Revelation 2:7):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg4.gif" width="512" height="366"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The number Six is situated at the center of the great mandala 
  of the Tree of Life. It represents everything that has been hidden there, and 
  revealed there, since the idea of the Tree of Life itself began to impress itself 
  upon the consciousness of <i>man</i> in the garden of Eden. It first of all 
  represents the moment of Creation, the Navel of Reality. (Please see chapter 
  1, Part 2)....</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg06.gif" width="662" height="301"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> It represents that first moment in time and space when a Four-dimensional 
  (Ten-dimensional) universe exploded into existence as the God of Heaven and 
  Earth (the God who is All and fills All), (E=mc2), literally transformed Themselves 
  into all that exists, carrying with Them into the phenomenal world all of the 
  patterns of Divine Thought that have been, and which are still yet informing 
  the mind of Humanity. <i>In the beginning </i>the Torah says<i>...</i>(Genesis 
  1:1). &quot;We couldn't get over the idea of Ten dimensions&quot; modern physics 
  says.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> They (YHVH-Elohim--a Name which also reveals itself in the 
  numerical and historical dimensions of the Tree of Life) descended from world 
  to world (from the Kabbalistic world of Emanation through the descending worlds 
  named Creation and Formation, to the lower world called Action--the world that 
  is apparent to our physical senses). They descended, across eons of time, through 
  all of the great stellar events that led to the eventual formation of this Solar 
  system and its Nine major attending planets. (Look up on a star-filled night. 
  One cannot behold the Heavens above, or any other aspect of the Natural world 
  below, without beholding the Face of God). As the Oracle shapeshifts from form 
  to form we see that the number Six now represents the (familiar astrological 
  symbol of the) planet Earth. It represents the lower, natural world (and the 
  Six cardinal directions that emanate from every central point on earth: North-South, 
  East-West, Above and Below); and along with these every possible spiritual choice 
  the soul may take in its own present journey through the realm of human consciousness, 
  Left-Right, Forward-Backward, Up and Down. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Tiferet.GIF" width="129" height="96"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> The number Six represents the metaphysical dimensions of our 
  own world, the world into which all Ten Sefiroth descended to create the primal 
  human soul and eventually, in historical time, the mind of Man itself in Their 
  own invisible image. (Genesis 1:26,27)...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg128.gif" width="489" height="365"></p>
  <p align="center"><b>In the beginning was the Word...(John 1:1).</b></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center"><b>The pattern of the Oracle governs and regulates the gates 
      and passageways (the human senses) that lead both in and out between the 
      outside world and the inside world of the individual soul. (Isaiah 61:3). 
      The Oracle is a map of human consciousness.</b> </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus, just as the Universe was born at the Navel of its own 
  existence so the number Six now also represents the natural earth-born conception 
  of every human child. (1 Corinthians 15:46-49). And as every human child is 
  born into the natural world of its own existence, into the world of its own 
  lower propensities and natural inclinations, so the Scripture says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons 
    of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves 
    are beasts...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ecclesiastes 3:18).</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">And</font><i><font size="+1">...Marvel not that I said unto 
    thee, Ye must be born again...</font></i><font size="+1">(John 3:7).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Being <i>born again </i>means transcending the natural realm. 
  It ultimately means being able to see into, and through the structural illusions 
  of the lower world, into the hidden dimensions of time and space (Ephesians 
  3:17-19), gaining access in the process to a glimpse of God's invisible Presence 
  filling up the whole of Reality itself. (The poor and oppressed, those rich 
  in faith, can already sense it. Unlike the intellectuals and worldlings of the 
  religious world, they never ask, &quot;Where is God?&quot; God is as close as 
  one's own thoughts. What ever one is sensing, feeling or seeing is God. The 
  struggle that common people have--the confusion they experience--is with the 
  written word itself, and the way it is being interpreted for us by the false 
  shepherds, the intellectuals and the prophets of Ba'al in our time. Our perceptions 
  are confounded by those (the preachers and the intellects), whose minds are 
  not connected to the Mind of Creation and whose hearts are not connected to 
  the Heart of the Universe). For in Reality nothing exists but God. (God has 
  many Names and many forms. We are dealing here in this letter with Hebrew Names 
  and Hebrew forms). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And then we must perceive the other things that God has been 
  hiding all these thousands of years from those of the natural sort, from the 
  great sons of Darkness (from the Nimrods of the earth and their religious cohorts), 
  those who have been waging war in the earth in the name of God since the time 
  of Adam. Contrary to the spirit of Abel who pursued righteousness and justice, 
  and who put on the garments of complete pacifism after receiving the instructions 
  of Adam (Abel was the original Lamb of God), the spirit of Cain (you know, the 
  one who has <i>the mark...</i>Gen.4:8-16), continued in its fearful, warring 
  ways. Cain did not believe when it was told him that there is only ONE God (this 
  was a new understanding in the earth), and that that One God literally dwells 
  in all things and in every living being. (Romans 13). To continue therefore 
  in a warring state against any other tribe, any people, or any other nation, 
  is to be waging war against the very presence of God itself. Cain was instructed 
  to adjust to this sublime realization, to overcome his fears and to lay down 
  his arms, and to trust God to do likewise. (For this Lord of Heaven and Earth 
  was, and still is, <i>a God of War </i>and <i>a Consuming Fire</i>...Exodus 
  15:3; Deut.4:24; Heb.12:29)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The spirit of Cain would not, or rather, could not. God had 
  clouded his mind. (Please consider 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, KJV). The wickedness 
  of Cain had to come to perfection in the earth. History had to unfold as it 
  has, otherwise we could not have come to the end of this age as we have, witnessing 
  this Darkness in its most perfect and powerful form as we are. The words <i>Let 
  Us create Man in our image</i>, were only just spoken and set in motion at the 
  time. They are not complete yet. We are still be created. God also had to reveal 
  Themselves to the world in the process, so that there would be no mistake afterwards 
  as to how the world should be governed in the future, and in what ways the Lord 
  of Heaven and Earth would rise up again to destroy it if it should ever return 
  to the ways of this age. This <i>Theophany</i> is occurring in the earth at 
  this very moment in time. God is risen up everywhere now, in the sum of every 
  natural and human event, bringing Their own Creation to its just and righteous, 
  and may we add, its terrible conclusion. (There was no other way for them to 
  do it and still create us in Their own image). And besides, the number Seven, 
  a number which transcends the number Six, was already a geometric, and therefore 
  a creative concept in the Mind of God. The whole history of Adam has come to 
  pass in accordance with its design:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thus inside of this Circle of the Adamic age, and the history

  situated (as we shall see) at the place numbered Six at the center of the Mystery 
  of Christ on the Tree of Life. The world witnessed as the Lord Himself both 
  descended and rose up in all of the events of the First World War and destroyed

    of Christ on the Tree of Life (in the great Nonviolent Sacrifice of the Vedas, 
    as the Lamb of God, thus in the image of Abel the true adept in the hidden 
    science...Hebrews 12:13-15; 2 Peter 3:14), but continued at the same time

    of these historical events. This age is ending and a New Age is being born.

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Though it was perceived in the Rg Veda and in the Torah, and 
  by the sacred Shamans everywhere throughout the earth, we can now see what was 
  being hidden from the eyes of the sons of Darkness all these centuries? Indeed, 
  since the end of the Atlantean age when the waters (the wars) of Noah's time 
  overflowed the Western world (Revelation 17:15; Dan.9:26; Mth.24:38,39): the 
  countenance of the Great Dragon, Leviathan. It has been lying there at the center 
  of human consciousness (in the center of the Tree of Life, at the place numbered 
  Six) all this time. If Thomas Woodrow Wilson could have seen it in 1917, when 
  he declared war on central Europe, he would have thought differently about leading 
  the American people into that war. And if the American people could have seen 
  it they would not have followed him, or any other of the antichrists of this 
  age, into any of America's wars since that time. (Hebrews 12:13-15). They would 
  have been able to perceive the Presence of God in all of these matters, and 
  would have understood the full implications of the words which say: <i>In that 
  day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish Leviathan 
  the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that crooked serpent; and He shall slay 
  the Dragon that is in the sea.</i> (Isaiah 27:1). With the advent of the world 
  wars in the 20th century the end of the age was approaching. Many in the world 
  sensed it, the great mass of humanity did not. (Matthew, chapter 24): </font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The trumpet sounded at the beginning of the 20th century, and 
  God began to exact this final and most terrible series of judgments against 
  the Western world. (One would think that the most resistance to these things 
  would come from the conservatives, the capitalists and nationalists in the Judeao-Christian 
  world, seeing they are caught now, but we expect it from them. It is the Liberals 
  and intellectuals, however, who hate to hear it. They, almost even more than 
  their counterparts on the Right, want a world devoid of of God's Presence. They 
  too have vested interests in the world as it is. They too like sitting on top 
  of the social order. [Ezekiel 18]. But despite every opinion from the Right 
  or the Left, spiritual reality is at it is, and as it has already come to pass, 
  and as it is presently unfolding. It is for us to open our eyes to the sublime 
  Reality of God's Presence. We ourselves, as sons and daughters of peace, children 
  of unwavering nonviolence, stand ready with the poor and oppressed in the earth 
  to inhabit a coming world--a world in which true freedom, true righteousness, 
  true justice and true love will be the order of the day. (1 Samuel 2:1-10; Luke 
  1:46-55). In order for that world to appear this world must collapse. We are 
  witnessing the collapse...Matthew 7:22-27). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These judgments began at the time of the First World War, as 
  it is written: <i>And these are the beginning of sorrows</i>. (Matthew 24:8). 
  They began at the very same time that God was also raising up the kingdom of 
  modern Babylon in the West, as it was also written: <i>...For I will work a 
  work in your days, which you will not believe, though it be told you</i>. (Habakkuk 
  1:1-17; Acts 13:40,41). This, of course, is the United States of America in 
  the 20th century--the final kingdom of the antichrists (2 Thessalonians 2, 1 
  John 2:15-20...KJV). In the almost complete absence of any reverence or fear 
  for the Power of God the people blindly followed the leaders of America headlong 
  into the World Wars of the 20th century. <i>Come not up</i>, the scriptures 
  said. (Exodus 19:12). The people went up. The First war led almost immediately 
  to the Second, and the words were fulfilled which said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>For this</i> <i>they willingly are ignorant of, that by 
    the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the 
    water and in the water:</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with 
    water, perished.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same 
    word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and 
    perdition of ungodly men.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one 
    day is with the Lord as a Thousand years, and a Thousand years as one day...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Peter 3:5-8).</font><i><font size="+1"> </font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And likewise, all of the events of the Second World War have 
  been leading directly to a Third, as it is written: <i>And when the Thousand 
  years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison. And shall go out 
  to deceive the nations which are in the Four quarters of the earth...</i>Revelation 
  20:7,8). (Please consider Chapter 3 in this work, as well as Revelation, chapter 
  18). The number <i>One Thousand</i> in the preceding text must not be understood 
  literally, as it is also written: <i>For a Thousand years in Thy sight are but 
  as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. </i>(Psalm 90:4). 
  The number 1,000 itself represents the mind that is coming to spiritual perfection. 
  It is the cube of the mystery of the Tree of Life (10 X 10 X 10). The number 
  represents the mind that can perceive how the higher City of Jerusalem <i>(the 
  City Above, the Mother of us all</i>...Galatians 4:26), hidden from the eyes 
  of history all these Jubilees of years, is descending once again into the plain 
  of human consciousness in the form of a Cube inside of a Square. (Revelation 
  21:16).</font></p>

  in the time of the early Church and concealed in the myths and legends of <i>Shambalah</i>. 
  (For an understanding of these things please see the chapter entitled <i>Kalachakra</i>

  Jewry could not understand when it entered into that pact with the nations of 
  the earth--the Balfour Declaration--which allowed it to turn backwards away 
  from the Light, imagining in the great social upheavals and judgments of those 
  times that it was returning to the City of David, when in fact it was abandoning 
  it, just as it did in the centuries leading up to the time of Christ. This was

  war against God (the very God who was beginning now to judge the world because 
  of its warring ways, because of its ultimate refusal to hear the true prophets 
  and the true saints that He had sent into the world all these centuries, warning 
  them of this very day...please understand Jeremiah, chapter 25 in this light), 
  but that he was also declaring war on the City of Jerusalem itself. He would 
  not, of course, have declared war on that city made of stone below, in Palestine, 
  the one he could see, but God deceived him, and caused him to declare war on 
  the Higher City, the City Above, the one that was hidden completely from his 
  natural mind. </font></p>

<p><i><font size="+1">Beware, </font></i><font size="+1">Paul said, <i>when this 
  day comes. </i>(Acts 13:38-41; Habakkuk, chapter 1). In the unseeing and unbelieving 
  Thomas Woodrow Wilson God was setting up the <i>Image of the Beast.</i> It was 
  in fulfillment of Nebuchednezzar, the king of Babylon's vision in Daniel, chapter 
  4. (KJV). In Wilson's time, however, the Image is only Sixty cubits high, as 
  it is written:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height 
    was Sixty cubits, and the breadth Six cubits; he set it up in the Plain of 
    Dura, in the province of Babylon...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 3:1). 
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The authors of the Book of Revelation had a deeply intuitive 
  and prophetic sense of the number Sixty. Just as we in our time employ a base-ten 
  mathematical system, the ancient Babylonians employed a base-sixty system. And 
  because some of that system has carried into modern usage, particularly in the 
  way we calculate time, our clocks are designed on the basis of Sixty seconds 
  in a minute, and Sixty minutes in an hour. Thus the number Sixty represents 
  the completion of a circle in time, and particularly the great circle of time 
  that has transpired since the 6th century B.C. when God raised up the warrior 
  kingdom of Babylon in the East, and the 20th century A.D. when God raised up 
  the kingdom of Babylon again in the West.</font></p>

    4:11). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The number Sixty does not only project the Image of Nebuchadnezzar's 
  dream from the ancient past into the future, but upwards from the time of Woodrow 
  Wilson into our very own time. For remember, in addition to being a description 
  of an entire world order (an entire geopolitical system of things--the American 
  order of things to be exact), the number 660 and 6 is the number of <i>a man</i>, 
  as it is written: <i>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his 
  (own) stature?</i> (Matthew 6:27). Sixty years after Woodrow Wilson, the 12th 
  of these kings of Babylon, James Earl Carter, will come to power in the earth. 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore will I now beseech the Highest, that he will 
    comfort me unto the end.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And I said, Lord that beareth rule, if I have found grace 
    before thy sight...Comfort me then, and shew me thy servant the interpretation 
    and plain difference of this fearful vision...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he said unto me, This is the interpretation of the 
    vision:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Eagle, whom thou sawest come up from the sea, is the 
    kingdom which was seen in the vision of thy brother Daniel. But it was not 
    expounded unto him, therefore now I declare it unto thee.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Behold, the days will come, that there shall rise up a 
    kingdom upon earth, and it shall be feared above all the kingdoms that were 
    before it.</font></i></p>

    Esdras 6-14) (KJV).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> We have added 60 cubits to each of these administrations, 
  for reasons that are clear to every child of Light. Each of these American leaders 
  was under the same historical spell, taken with the same delusions--by the same 
  extraordinary sense of themselves as was Wilson--and driven by the same will-to-force, 
  despite the words which said: <i>But it shall not be so among you</i>. (Matthew 
  20:25,26).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And then, in light of the words at Daniel 3:1, where it says 
  that Nebuchanezzar the king (Woodrow Wilson) set up the Image on <i>The Plain 
  of Dura in the province of Babylon</i>, we read the following page from a book 
  entitled <i>Miss Lillian and Friends</i>, written by the Carter family about 
  the Carter family:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Carter.gif" width="482" height="393"></p>
<p><font size="+1">Set up upon the Plain of Dura in the province of Babylon, when 
  the Image reaches the administration of Jimmy Carter it is 660 cubits high. 
  It is still only Six cubits wide. (Six hundred Sixty and Six). It is the image 
  of the power and majesty of the office of the President of the United States 
  of America, the most powerful office that has ever existed in the history of 
  Western man.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose 
    names are not written in the book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation 
    of the earth...</font></i><font size="+1">(Revelation 13:8). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In Carter's time the office seemed to suffer a loss of prestige. 
  His seemingly Christian world-view appeared unequal to the conditions that God 
  was creating in the world around him at the time. In a recent book entitled 
  <i>The Unfinished Presidency of Jimmy Carter, </i> by Douglas Brinkley, the 
  author said that Jimmy Carter, nevertheless, went on to use his loss of the 
  White House as a stepping-stone to greater global achievement. The Scriptures 
  say that he is a proud and ambitious man (Habakkuk 2:4-6), one who speaks <i>peace</i> 
  with his mouth, while in his heart is <i>not peace but a sword</i>. (Please 
  see the chapter entitled <i>Jimmy Carter</i> in the Addendum to this Commentary). 
  Elected out of office in favor of Ronald Wilson Reagan and George H. W. Bush, 
  both of whom came into office together, the world was prepared for the second 
  phase of this revelation:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Needless to say, this is a prophetic description of American 
  foreign policy in the earth up to, and since the Reagan and Bush administrations. 
  It will soon become a description of America's domestic policy as all the remaining 
  prophecies in the Book of Revelation unfold. In Woodrow Wilson's time the Soviet 
  Union came to power (Rev.6:3,4). In Ronald Wilson Reagan's time the Soviet Union 
  collapsed, releasing all of the conditions in the earth that have led to the 
  world's present economic, political and military situations. There are no other 
  antichrists coming. They are already here. There is no other temple to be built 
  other than the one that God has already built. It is the only temple that God 
  has ever dwelt in:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the 
    Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; 
    for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Corinthians 3:16,17; Ephesians 2:19-22). </font></p>

    the son of perdition;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called

    shewing himself that he is God...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 Thessalonians 
    2:1-12).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">How have these leaders been revealing themselves to be as God? 
  By coming to power in the midst of the people, in the midst of God's temple, 
  and by exercising the power of life and death over other human beings in the 
  Name of Christ. Anyone who takes the life of another person in the name of Christ, 
  no matter what the reason, is an antichrist. Anyone who raises himself up above 
  a nation of antichrists is <i>the antichrist</i>. (Open the book of 1 John and 
  understand its epic, historic, prophetic and present implications). Of the kings 
  of Babylon it is written:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE NEOCONS AND WOODROW 
  WILSON</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By PHILIP GOLD</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><br>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sunday, May 11, 2003. I know from 
    neocons. Midge Decter, the movement's grande dame, introduced me to journalism 
    in 1981. She and neocon&quot;godfather&quot; Irving Kristol helped get me 
    the grant for my first book. Throughout the '80s and much of the '90s, while 
    living in Washington, D.C., I worked with neocons, wrote for them, attended 
    their conferences, appeared with them on panels and occasionally drank their 
    whiskey. I still read their stuff and, for the most part, I like them as people. 
    But I also know that, in three critical ways, Joshua Muravchik's description 
    elides some unflattering truths.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, neoconservatism is a multigenerational 
    movement that has never really been conservative or fully accepted by the 
    mainstream, let alone the fringes. At its best, it was a valuable aberration. 
    Today, it's maligned. Second, although the younger neocons, the Boom X generation, 
    are Republicans, THEY DRAW THEIR DEEPEST SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION FROM WOODROW 
    WILSON. That's a dangerous liaison. And third, there's the matter of neocon 
    &quot;influence&quot; -- an issue that, sadly, cannot be divorced from the 
    tawdry subject of anti-Semitism and its present real and/or alleged reinvigoration. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEOCONSERVATISM, as Muravchik notes, 
    AROSE IN THE 70s AS A REACTION TO THE 60s. IT WAS AT FIRST A NEW YORK PHENOMENON 
    AND MOSTLY, though far from entirely, JEWISH. It reflected the sensibilities 
    of a unique generation of intellectuals, often starting out as the poor children 
    of immigrants, who made the long march from Brooklyn and City College of New 
    York and FDR for some and Trotsky for others, to that literary section of 
    Manhattan where they take their politics and their cocktail parties -- and 
    their book reviews -- very, very seriously. These were people of ideas, always 
    articulate and often brilliant, who'd also known depression, war, discrimination 
    and lives of unrelenting effort. They had struggled and succeeded. They were, 
    in short, full dues-paying members of the Greatest Generation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And neoconservatism was as much 
    their personal journey, their midlife crisis, as a political movement. Irving 
    Kristol, a founder of &quot;The Public Interest,&quot; and Norman Podhoretz, 
    former editor of &quot;Commentary&quot; and author of &quot;Making It,&quot; 
    have written movingly of this. THEIR BREAK WITH THE LEFT WAS PAINFUL AND COMPLEX, 
    BOTH A FAREWELL TO THEIR OWN GENERATION AND A REPUDIATION OF THE 1960s NEW 
    LEFT EXCESSES that their former friends' children had wrought. The children 
    they chided for their tantrums and immaturity, the parents for their excessive 
    tolerance and flaccidity in the face of barbarisms both foreign and domestic.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Midge Decter's &quot;Liberal Parents, 
    Radical Children&quot; can still be read with profit here. Indeed, many saw 
    liberalism's greatest failure AS A MATTER OF &quot;WILL&quot; AND &quot;NERVE,&quot; 
    two favorite neocon value-words, especially when dealing with communists and 
    kids. AND WHEN THEY TOOK UP RONALD (WILSON) REAGAN, it was his steady anti-communism 
    that they found most attractive. All in all, they were the right people at 
    the right time. THEY HELPED FASHION THE &quot;WILL&quot; AND THE &quot;NERVE&quot; 
    THAT BROUGHT THE SOVIETS DOWN. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nor are their children lacking 
    in will, certainly not in the chicken hawk sense -- an unfair epithet, but 
    not entirely inapt, APPLIED TO THOSE WHO URGE WAR and pander to bellicosity 
    BUT NEVER SERVED, OR WILL SERVE, THEMSELVES. What they are lacking is their 
    parents' depth and life experiences. And perhaps it is not too much to suggest 
    that the current leadership of the movement shows more than a trace of the 
    arrogance imputed to Boomer and Generation X left radicals, and of the infatuation 
    with their own theories that only those who've never been smacked upside the 
    head by reality (poverty, unfriendly fire, hard bigotry) can indulge. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What theories? Today, the Boomer/Generation 
    X neocons invoke icons of steadfastness such as Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan, 
    even Winston Churchill. But neocon writer and former Wall Street Journal editor 
    Max Boot caught it best some months ago WHEN HE DESCRIBED THEIR PREFERRED 
    FOREIGN POLICY AS &quot;HARD WILSONIANISM&quot;-- making the world safe for 
    democracy, THIS TIME WITH THE WILL AND THE NERVE AND THE POWER TO MAKE IT 
    STICK. Whatever else this may be, it is not conservatism, which holds these 
    truths to be self-evident: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">History does not begin anew with 
    us. We cannot force people to be free. Evil is real and, therefore, best we 
    take a modest, exceedingly modest, view of our ability to change human nature. 
    And speaking of human nature, power corrupts. It corrupts those who wield 
    it. And it corrupts those who seek to influence those who wield it. WHEN WOODROW 
    WILSON SAILED FOR THE VERSAILLES PEACE CONFERENCE IN 1919, HE TOOK WITH HIM 
    A TRAVELIING THINK TANK KNOWN AS &quot;THE INQUIRY.&quot; He exhorted these 
    young intellectuals, some of whom wrote for and most of whom read The New 
    Republic: &quot;TELL ME WHAT'S RIGHT AND I WILL FIGHT FOR IT!&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WE'RE STILL TRYING TO CLEAN UP 
    THE MESS THOSE INTELLECTUALS MADE. And in some ways, from &quot;The New Republic&quot; 
    then to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; now, not that much of a change. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which brings us to the subject 
    of influence. Muravchik is right. Some of President Bush's policies &quot;resemble 
    things advocated by neocons,&quot; but &quot;Who knows how Bush decides?&quot; 
    (Does Bush always know?) And anyway, as Midge Decter wisely warned me, influence 
    can never be claimed. It can only be bestowed by those who are influenced. 
    What is bestowed can be taken away. Even the appearance of influence can lead 
    to an unpleasant backlash. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And if you're Jewish, and high-visibility, 
    and associated with controversial policies and perilous actions, if your name 
    is Kristol (Irving or son Bill) or Podhoretz (Norman or son John) or Kagan 
    or Perle or Wolfowitz or Frum, backlash can get ugly. Is this happening? It's 
    hard to say. It's expected that the Arab press would run articles headlined, 
    &quot;PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF NEOCON.&quot; It's not surprising when neocons 
    such as David Brooks complain in print about anti-Semitic e-mails and phone 
    messages. It's business-as-usual when segments of the far right and the farther 
    left find themselves accused of bigotry masquerading as anti-Zionism, or anti-neoconism. 
    But it's something else entirely to hear, as I have, military officers speak 
    openly and contemptuously of &quot;the Likudniks in the E-Ring&quot; (Likud 
    being Ariel Sharon's party, the E-Ring the Pentagon corridor where the senior 
    leadership hangs out). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And it's scary to realize that 
    the United States has undertaken to remake the Islamic world in our own image 
    and to our own satisfaction, by military conquest and occupation and the making 
    of examples, in order to encourage the others. And harder still to know that 
    the most prominent advocates of THIS NEW WILSONIAN IMPERIALISM are a small 
    group of public intellectuals with no significant political or cultural base 
    and scant knowledge of the nation beyond the Beltway or the world beyond their 
    abstractions. And it would be tragic, were a movement that did some good once, 
    to be remembered -- mostly for its part in marching the nation toward folly.</font></p>
