<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SACRED RIVERS</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by W.T.S. Thackara</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Explore the River of the Soul, whence or in what order 
    you have come: so that although you have become a servant to the body, you 
    may again rise to the order from which you descended, joining works to sacred 
    reason (logos).</font> </i><b>The Chaldean Oracle, 172</b>.</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rivers appear frequently in the 
    world's sacred traditions as symbols of divine influence and of life's interdependence. 
    They evoke an image of spiritual-intellectual energies cascading through the 
    manifold planes of cosmic and individual life--linking us intimately with 
    our spiritual source, nourishing and sustaining us, and flowing forth to connect 
    us with all things. We may recall, for example, the Hindus' description of 
    the Ganges descending from heaven, encircling Brahma's city of gold on the 
    summit of Meru, the earth's central mountain, then dividing into Four rivers 
    which flow to the four points of the compass. Embodied in this imagery--geometrically 
    describing a Pyramid--is a set of ideas suggesting a continuous flow of life, 
    wisdom, and guidance from our original homeland to every corner of the world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like the ancient Egyptians who 
    understood the gift of the Celestial Nile as well as of its earthly counterpart, 
    we can be enriched by exploring these ancient waterways; so that next time 
    we see a Christian baptism, or millions of Hindus assembling on the banks 
    of the Ganges, the inner significance of these rites and celebrations will 
    be apparent, serving as a refreshing draft from the Well of Memory deep within 
    us. For sacred rivers are not only mythic reminders of forgotten truth, they 
    represent the ever-present stream of who and what we essentially are: not 
    a static being, but a dynamic ever-becoming flow of godlike radiance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Turning to the source of rivers 
    at the beginning of time, ancient philosophers often described a seed or egg 
    containing the potency of our universe gestating in the womb of infinite space 
    and duration...</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Following the analogy of nature, 
    which is cyclical and self-reproducing throughout, this seed may be seen as 
    the fruit of our ancestors, previous universes infilled with life, intelligence 
    and consciousness. It is natural then to visualize this infinitesimal seed 
    bursting forth at its appointed time in a torrential river of consciousness-energy 
    substance, flooding space with radiant &quot;waters&quot;--the primordial 
    chaos--from which arises galaxies, star systems, and garden planets like our 
    own Mother Earth. On the microcosmic scale, even our physical bodies--whose 
    atoms were spun in the heart of the sun--are an ever-flowing fabric of dazzling, 
    coruscating energies, coursing on streambeds patterned in the collective mind 
    of our creators.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These thought may be discerned 
    in our oldest myth--for what did the ancient Sumerian and Babylonian poets 
    have in mind when recounting the adventures of Gilgamesh: whose search for 
    immortality and the meaning of life led him to humanity's Forefather, WHO 
    DWELT &quot;ACROSS THE SEA&quot; with the gods IN THE &quot;GARDEN OF THE 
    SUN&quot; at the &quot;MOUTH OF RIVERS&quot;? Perhaps they, too, had a natural 
    intuition of the periodically surging life-force flowing from the sun and 
    beyond into our world. It is a theme mirrored in the story of another well-known 
    garden, this one here on earth.&quot;There was a river flowing from Eden to 
    water the garden, and when it left the garden it branched into Four streams...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As rivers descend from their pristine 
    sources, from rain and snow, they pick up the silts and other qualities of 
    the regions they pass through, as well as the grosser pollutions we humans 
    contribute to muddy these life-giving streams, whether they be physical of 
    mental. Homer and Plato almost certainly had this latter aspect in mind when 
    describing the descent of rivers into the nether worlds. In the Greek cosmogony, 
    the Titan Oceanus, first-born of Heaven and Earth, is described as the father 
    of all rivers and is himself a celestial river whose waters surround the earth. 
    Among his daughters, sometimes numbered in the thousands, are the Four principle 
    rivers of the underworld, and also Lethe, the River of Forgetfulness and Oblivion. 
    These eventually combine to flow South...until they discharge their remaining 
    contents into Tartarus. Here in the underworld they function as a purgative, 
    cleansing human souls of selfish mental and emotional qualities which are 
    &quot;lethal&quot; or otherwise harmful to their evolutionary progress </font>(Cf. 
    <i>Phaedo 14</i>)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Myths suggest that the sacred river 
    is an integral feature of the spiritual-mental-physical ecosystem of the universe, 
    and its descent through the three worlds of heaven, earth and the underworld 
    is perhaps given fullest expression in the mythology of the Ganges, of Ganga, 
    the holiest of India's rivers. Personified as a goddess, Mother Ganges is 
    the life-giving maternal waters, the intelligent Feminine energy of the universe, 
    and wife/consort of the great god Siva, the destroyer of form, regenerator 
    of life, and patron of mystic students...thus enabling them to attain paradise.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ganga's descent to earth in Three

    may also be interpreted as representing the Seven planes of the universe: 
    Seven grades or qualities of conciousness-substance originating from a single

    consciousness--spirit, intuition, and intellect--and the Four energy-substance

  <p>T he Apalachicola National Forest consists of a half-million acres of land, 
    of which one-half is located in Liberty County. This forest is a land of swamps 
    and hammocks untouched by man, as primitive still as when the Indians for 
    whom it is named trod its many trails and canoed in its many waters. For recreational 
    purposes ten areas have been developed. The most extensive being Camel Lake, 
    a few miles south of the city of Bristol. At the lake there is swimming, boating 
    and skiing and throughout the forest are many acres for fishing and hunting 
    for such game as deer, bear and the American gobbler. Here, too, is the Florida 
    panther, the only state in the eastern United States where the panther is

    is the site of the true Garden of Eden. Some say that this assertion is fiction, 
    without foundation, while others say that it is true and a book has been written 
    to support the claim. There is scientific evidence that the adjacent river 
    bluffs and ravines are the same today as they were a million years ago but 
    evidence of a garden environment has not been affirmed. But if the claim is 
    true, then here in the pleasant clime of Liberty County, Florida...and here 
    was the home of Adam and Eve. </p>

<p></p>
<p><font size="+1">Both the foregoing, and the following article, were taken from

</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Published on Sunday, May 11, 1997</p>
  <p>It's a Tuesday, sometime between the beginning and the end of the world, 
    and Harry Hagan is driving his van to the Garden of Eden.</p>
  <p> This van has some problems. Its heater fan continues to run when the ignition 
    is turned off, for example, and a weird kind of engin rattle is audible during 
    acceleration.But in the context of this trip, so what? Hagan's van could have 
    two dead cylinders and a dime-sized radiator-hole, and still it wouldn't matter. 
    The Garden of Eden, you see, is only a 17-minute drive (including delays caused 
    by road construction) from Hagan's home in Blountstown, a small Panhandle 
    town (pop. 2,500) that hugs the west bank of the Apalachicola River.</p>
  <p> Hagan, who refused to give his age but looks about 55, is now halfway across 
    the bridge to Bristol (pop. 1,000), which hugs the river's east bank. He motors 
    through Bristol, then turns north onto State 12. Just outside the town limits, 
    he proclaims: &quot;There it is!&quot; Visible out the driver's side window 
    is a huge fist of woods, which is bisected by a rutted dirt path. A tiny hand-lettered 
    sign identifies this path as: &quot;GARDEN OF EDEN ROAD.&quot;</p>
  <p> Hagan steers his van about a hundred yards down Garden of Eden Road, then 
    stops - a metal gate blocks the road; a small cut in the abutting barbed-wire 
    fence allows only humans to pass. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; asks Hagan, who 
    is outspoken and sarcastic and kind of a Burl Ives lookalike. He disembarks 
    from the van and squints into the late-morning sun. &quot;Are you ready to 
    enter the`Garden of Eden?&quot;</p>
  <p>It sounds bizarre and kind of crackpot-ish, like saying that the Holy Grail 
    has just been unearthed outside Nashville. But a lot of people in Bristol 
    and Blountstown actually seem to believe that the original Garden of Eden 
    is located in their backyard. &quot;I definitely do believe that,&quot; says 
    Hagan, owner/operator of the only two radio stations in Blountstown. &quot;I 
    haven't been convinced that it's not the case,&quot; says Johnny Eubanks, 
    publisher of the only newspaper in Bristol. &quot;Beyond reasonable doubt?&quot; 
    asks Liberty County Judge Ken Hosford, 40. &quot;I don't think that the evidence 
    is that strong. But if you're looking at it more like from a civil standard 
    - the preponderance of the evidence, you know, a 50-50 type of thing -it's 
    a lot more compelling.&quot;</p>
  <p>The theory has kind of been floating around since the 1960s, when an eccentric 
    Alabama-born lawyer named E.E. Callaway published a book called <i>In the 
    Beginning</i>. According to Callaway: In 1946, God lured him from Lakeland, 
    in southern Florida, to Bristol for unknown reasons. Soon after he arrived 
    in Bristol, however, the purpose of his move revealed itself--he was to show 
    the world the location of the Garden of Eden. He started gathering information. 
    After 20 years, he put all of it into a 99-page book. This book points to 
    all kinds of Biblical &quot;evidence&quot; (more on this later), and arrives 
    early on at a fantastic conclusion: &quot;I have definitely located and pointed 
    out the Original Garden of Eden,&quot;</p>
  <p>Callaway asserts on page 14. Although not a bestseller, the book brought 
    Callaway international attention - a team of Israeli rabbis once visited him 
    at his tree-shaded Bristol home to ask him some questions. By most accounts, 
    Callaway was more than willing to entertain such groups. Indeed, he apparently 
    had some trouble not talking about the Garden of Eden. </p>
  <p>&quot;When I first got to town in 1972, Callaway dropped by to welcome me,&quot; 
    says Blountstown lawyer Bill Corbin, 55. &quot;He spent 25 minutes talking 
    about the Garden of Eden, and he only stayed for half an hour. I had never 
    heard this stuff before, you know. I didn't know what was going on.&quot; 
    Callaway's not talking anymore, however. He now lies in a simple cemetery 
    on the edge of Bristol. His small granite headstone is surrounded by dead 
    leaves and dead grass. On some mornings, though, it catches the light and 
    sort of shines.</p>
  <p>Hagan is not alone as he walks into the Garden of Eden. By his side is a 
    47-year-old former drug addict with the peculiar name of Ivey Bailey. Bailey 
    is kind of integral to this story. A tireless and immensely agreeable guy, 
    Bailey claims to have had some visions himself recently about the Garden of 
    Eden (and about his youth organization, among other things), and he says he 
    has more or less picked up the torch E.E. Callaway dropped when he died, at 
    92, in 1981.</p>
  <p> Bailey, in other words, takes this whole Garden of Eden thing pretty seriously. 
    Hagan doesn't. They're kind of like an Odd Couple of Garden-of-Eden believers. 
    This is important, in a way. It's also frequently hilarious. Before they got 
    to the Garden, Hagan and Bailey stopped in at the local headquarters of the 
    Nature Conservancy, where they learned that the organization had purchased 
    the 1,300-acre Garden of Eden in 1982, with $1 million from an anonymous donor. 
    (The Nature Conservancy, incidentally, is a private organization that buys 
    land all over the country in the interest of preserving it. According to its 
    literature, it has &quot;protected&quot; more than 600,000 acres in Florida 
    alone. Its agents routinely call the Garden of Eden tract just that - &quot;the 
    Garden of Eden tract&quot; - though they insist the Conservancy bought it 
    because of certain peculiar formations there--namely, several steep ravines 
    - and not because of any alleged Biblical significance.)</p>
  <p> On the drive out of Conservancy headquarters, Bailey leaned over the backseat 
    and said, &quot;Wooooooh, is that spooky or what? A million dollars donated 
    by an anonymous donor? I'm tellin' you guys, you're being woven into the fabric 
    of a miracle.&quot; Hagan laughed sarcastically. &quot;What's the miracle, 
    Ivey? That we got a reporter to come out and cover this? Bailey sighed and 
    shook his head. This sort of thing would happen over and over. During the 
    three-hour hike through the Garden of Eden, Hagan managed to crack all kinds 
    of irreverent jokes in between wheezy gasps for air and repeated forehead-moppings. 
    At 12:39 p.m., for example, he said, &quot;I thought Adam and Eve were supposed 
    to wanna stay in the Garden of Eden? So how come I can't wait to get out of 
    here and back into the air-conditioning?&quot; He laughed wildly. Faced with 
    these cracks, Ivey would inevitably shake his head and say &quot;Harrrryyyy&quot; 
    scoldingly, then endeavor to give the proceedings a more serious tenor. At 
    12:41, in response to Hagan's latest outburst (and after the requisite head-shake 
    and scold), Bailey talked about his visions for awhile, and how he genuinely 
    believes it to be his God-given purpose to get out the story of the &quot;real&quot; 
    Garden of Eden. </p>
  <p> &quot;I am a true believer,&quot; Ivey then emphasized. &quot;A true believer.&quot; 
    Hagan, meanwhile, repeatedly talked about &quot;exploiting&quot; the Garden 
    of Eden and &quot;capitalizing&quot; on it. &quot;I believe a hundred percent 
    that it's the true Garden of Eden,&quot; he said while slumped inside his 
    climate-controlled radio station after the hike. He then flashed a sinister 
    grin, laughed slyly and said: &quot;We'll get more tourists if I say that.&quot;</p>
  <p> It could probably be argued that many (if not most) believers have entertained, 
    at one time or another, some crass Hagan-type thoughts. The Bristol publisher 
    Johnny Eubanks, for one, admits that he and seven other investors purchased 
    the Garden of Eden in the 1970s as an &quot;investment.&quot; &quot;We were 
    trying to capitalize on a planned development,&quot; said Eubanks, 65. &quot;See, 
    there was this group of people from Chicargo&quot;--that's the way he says 
    it, Chicargo - &quot;who were going to build a Biblical theme park there, 
    and one of 'em, strangely enough, was a Jewish fella. Anyway, it was going 
    to have the same type of activities that your Six Flags would have or your 
    Disney World, you know, but it was going to have a Garden of Eden-type theme.&quot; 
    He paused for awhile, then picked back up: &quot;Had that gone through, we 
    woulda made a lot more money than we did.&quot; Even &quot;true believer&quot; 
    Bailey instructed you to &quot;write the story up good,&quot; reasoning this 
    might give him a better chance at landing on a television talk show sometime 
    soon.</p>
  <p>Of course, not everybody around Blountstown and Bristol is a believer. The 
    local religious community seems to have long ago dismissed Callaway's theories. 
    Christian dogma, after all, has always put the site of the Garden of Eden 
    somewhere around the Middle East. John Banks, however, seems to have given 
    a little more thought to his disbelief. A retired safety engineer living in 
    Blountstown, he now amuses himself by writing books on &quot;human behavior,&quot; 
    and playing in a band, and some other stuff that was over your head. He kept 
    calling Panama City &quot;Pan City&quot; and volunteered to do some &quot;field 
    work&quot; for you. He declined to reveal his age. &quot;Just put in there 
    that I'm retired,&quot; he said, &quot;and they'll know that I'm up in years.&quot;</p>
  <p> Concerning Callaway's book, he thinks it makes for a &quot;wonderful&quot; 
    folk tale. &quot;But I just doesn't feel there's that much sense in it,&quot; 
    said Banks. &quot;There's no doubt about it - it's entirely illegitimate. 
    There is no foundation for the theories, I'm sure of it. From an academic 
    sort of view, all his `evidence' is worthless.&quot; Now might be a good point 
    to examine some of Callaway's &quot;evidence.&quot; Some of it is ridiculous. 
  </p>
  <p>In Genesis, the Bible states that giants, mighty men roamed the Garden during 
    pre-Flood days. So, on page 61 of In the Beginning, Callaway offers the astonishing 
    (and entirely false) &quot;evidence&quot; that the skeleton of a giant man 
    was once unearthed around Sneads. And some of it is just plain strange. Throughout 
    his book, Callaway claims to have interpreted much of his &quot;evidence&quot; 
    using the &quot;basic proportionals&quot; of 1, 4 and 7; the &quot;primary 
    proportionals&quot; of 13, 19, 25 and 31; and the &quot;secondary proportionals&quot; 
    of 10, 16, 22 and 28. (Your guess is as good as anybody's.)</p>
  <p> But some of Callaway's arguments seem to make sense:--The Bible says that 
    the Garden of Eden was watered by a river with four heads; the Apalachicola 
    River has four heads. The Bible says that one of these head-rivers flows through 
    a place full of gold, gum resin and striated marble: Georgia is rife with 
    all three.</p>
  <p> - The Bible says that the Garden of Eden contained an extraordinary variety 
    of flora and fauna; the &quot;Garden of Eden tract,&quot; according to the 
    Nature Conservancy's Greg Seamon, contains one of the most rare and diverse 
    ecosystems known to man: that of the steephead ravine.</p>
  <p> The Bible (at least the King James version) says that Noah built his Ark 
    from &quot;gopherwood&quot; culled from the Garden of Eden; the &quot;Garden 
    of Eden tract&quot; is one of the few places on earth where Torreya taxifolia, 
    more commonly known as the gopherwood tree, grows. None of this is proof, 
    of course. It could easily be argued, for example, that the Biblical gopherwood 
    and the Liberty County gopherwood are simply namesakes. If nothing else, though, 
    there's enough semi-plausible stuff there for believers to at least cling 
    to.</p>
  <p>&quot;Here's what I think,&quot; said Ken Hosford, the Liberty County judge, 
    as a sort of summation. &quot;If it were proved true that the Garden of Eden 
    was really here, you know, I think that would be nice. I'd sort of smile about 
    it. But if it were proved not true, I wouldn't be alarmed. It wouldn't make 
    or break my day either way.&quot; This statement kind of defies easy analysis, 
    yet it seems somehow telling. Hosford simply could have been distancing himself 
    from a semi-questionable theory, of course. But it's also possible that he 
    was trying to communicate something deeper about how, past a certain point, 
    impressiveness is corrosive to the psyche. And it's at least conceivable that 
    he was saying that he just doesn't need the Garden of Eden to be north of 
    Bristol, which is not at all the sense one gets from Harry Hagan and Ivey 
    Bailey, although they have their disparate reasons.</p>
  <p> The two men have been walking through Eden for about an hour and a half 
    now, up and down 200-foot ravines, past live oaks and cacti, under an achingly 
    blue sky. Suddenly, Hagan points to a pristine lakeshore and says, &quot;See, 
    that's where Adam and Eve built their log home out of gopherwood.&quot; He 
    wheezes a crazy laugh. This brings the standard head-wagging and scolding 
    (&quot;Harrrryyyyy&quot;) from Bailey. But it also apparently wounds him in 
    an unprecedented way. &quot;I wish you wouldn't laugh when you say stuff like 
    that,&quot; he says, and adds, kind of sternly, &quot;I'm serious about this 
    stuff.&quot; Hagan stops abruptly and turns around. His next 31 words are 
    a weird mix of shallowness and depth, irreverence and insight. They seem to 
    capture the situation north of Bristol as good as any 31 (or 310) words can. 
    For these and other reasons, maybe we should let them be the last words in 
    this article:</p>
  <p> &quot;Well, Ivey,&quot; says Hagan, &quot;when I talked to God the other 
    day, I asked Him, `Is humor OK?' And He said, `Yeah, Harry, humor's all right. 
    I have a sense of humor Myself.'&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="+3">A Mystery in Northeast Georgia</font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Most of State 77 looks like any other two-lane blacktop road winding through 
    rural northeastern Georgia. Small farmhouses sit back from the highway, and 
    cattle graze in the pastures along the roadside. But in one pasture a few 
    miles from the Georgia-South Carolina state lines, a huge granite monument 
    called the Georgia Guidestones turns the heads of people passing by.</b></p>
  <p><b>Rising nearly 20 feet in the air, the guidestones could easily be mistaken 
    for the ancient Stonehenge monument in England. The unusual structure is possibly 
    the largest granite monument ever constructed, according to Hudson Cone of 
    the Elberton Granite Association. It is certainly one of the most mysterious.</b></p>
  <p><b>Five upright granite slabs, each weighing more than 40,000 pounds, support 
    a center &quot;gnomon&quot; stone. Covering the slabs, written in eight languages, 
    are the guides, 10 rules for rebuilding civilization if there ever is a need. 
    And like the ancient Druid structure that inspired these markers, astronomical 
    features mark the rising of the North Star and the sun, as well as the summer 
    and winter solstices.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/Guidestones2.gif" width="372" height="250"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>The Georgia Guidestones were quarried, carved, and set up by a granite 
    company in nearby Elberton. But the identities of the people who designed 
    and paid for the huge monument remain a mystery. According to Cone, the strange 
    tale started one Friday afternoon in 1979, when a visitor met with Joe Fendley, 
    president of the Elberton Granite Finishing Company and mayor of the town. 
    The stranger told Fendley his plans for the giant monument and asked if the 
    Elberton company could build the Guidestones &quot;Fendley thought the man 
    was kidding,&quot; Cone recalls. &quot;He told him what something of that 
    size would cost and the guy said 'no problem.'&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>Elberton's stonecarvers went to work, carefully inscribing the 10 guides 
    onto the huge granite slabs that had been hauled from one of the city's quarries. 
    The guides were written in English, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, 
    Swahili and Spanish. Among other things, the rules warn future generations 
    to &quot;avoid petty laws and useless officials,&quot; &quot;protect people 
    and nations with fair laws and just courts,&quot; and &quot;unite humanity 
    with a living new language.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>Why pick an out-of-the-way place like Elberton, Georgia, to put up a guide 
    for the future? According to Cone, &quot;they needed a place with a warm climate 
    near a granite production area. So this was the best place they could find. 
    But other residents point out that this section of northeast Georgia has always 
    been a place of mystery. A historical marker about a half mile from the guidestones 
    relates that the Cherokees considered the area &quot;the center of the world,&quot; 
    and for centuries they held religious ceremonies nearby. Only the people who 
    designed the monument know for sure if its part of that long mystical tradition.</b></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In general it may be said that

    and the Land of the Living, and which played a decisive role in the Tree cult 
    of the ancient world.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Closely akin to this image and 
    at times identical with it was the presumably older myth of a cosmic tree 
    or World Tree, usually conceived at the center of the earth--sometimes on 
    a Cosmic Mountain of the Gods--with its roots in the Underworld (the realm 
    of the Dead) and its crown in Heaven (realm of the Gods). In short, a sort 
    of imaginary axis mundi or World Pillar whose boughs, as Carlyle said of Yggdrasil, 
    are 'Histories of Nations,' its every leaf 'a biography,' every fiber 'an 
    act or word.'...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Mesoptamia this was elaborated 
    with the notion that the Divine Tree grew in the mythical Paradise at the 
    source of the Water of Life, where it was guarded and tended for the chief 
    deity by the primordial Man-King. In the ritual, the temple came to represent 
    the deity's 'heavenly dwelling,' the temple grove with the Sacred Tree the 
    legendary Paradise, and the sacral King as the deity's representative its 
    Gardener. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;No less interesting is the 
    parallel between the Temple as an image of the 'heavenly dwelling' and the 
    sanctuary which God on Mount Sinai commands Moses to build. 'And let them 
    make me a sanctuary,' the children of Israel are told, 'that I may dwell in 
    their midst. According to all that I show you concerning the pattern of the 
    tabernacle, and of all its furniture, so shall ye make it,' a reference to 
    heavenly 'patterns' also repeated, as we have seen, in the separate command

  his work since. Professor Zarins bases his theory on Landsat images from space, 
  which have, he says--in order to make the theory hold together--discovered fossil 
  rivers underneath the Arabian sands. His research is stretched (but, of course, 
  so is the Eden-Georgia hypothesis), and relies on too many suppositions and 
  suggestions that there are errors in the received traditions and written texts. 
  Nevertheless, an Arabian-Eden theory goes far in supporting our overall thesis 
  which holds that all things East are a reflection of realities West. The yearly 
  pilgrimage to Mecca itself is an Eastward reflection of the true path history 
  has taken, not only Seven times around the City Above (<i>the Mother of us all...</i>Galatians 
  4:21-26), but finally to the Western ends of the earth and the fulness of time. 
  Zarin's theory adds theological and historical weight to our own sense of things 
  laid out in the Eighteenth chapter of this work entitled <i>The Mystery of Islam</i>.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The genesis of this book was a 
    series of lectures in American literature at Middlebury College during the 
    year 1950-1951...(which were summerized) in an essay called The Garden in 
    America...Since then, I have felt the need to penetrate more deeply into the 
    origins and meaning of my subject and, above all, to show its broader application 
    to such other aspects of our civilization as art, industry, politics, and 
    foreign policy...The Edenic myth, it seems to me, has been the most powerful 
    and comprehensive organizing force in American culture...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because the center of creation 
    was believed to exist at the summit of a sacred mountain where heaven and 
    earth meet, every sacred city of actual history became by extension, as Eliade 
    says, a 'Sacred Mountain.' Thus when American colonists said that they were 
    going to establish in the New World 'A City on a Hill,' they meant to found 
    a sacred city and a new paradise...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Babylon was originally so settled. 
    An ancient map shows it at the center of a vast circular countryside bordered 
    by a river, 'precisely as the Sumerians envisioned Paradise.' Indeed the sacred 
    city takes on the character of the country surrounding it. Hebrew and Christian 
    writers frequently used the terms 'Jerusalem' and 'Paradise' interchangeably. 
    Thus Baruch, in the Syriac Apocalypse, has God complain of worldly Jerusalem. 
    'This building now built in your midst is not that which is revealed with 
    Me, that which was prepared beforehand here from the time I took counsel to 
    make Paradise, and showed it to Adam before he sinned.' </font>(See Hebrews 
    13:14; Galatians 4:21-26)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the earthly, temporal city 
    is always corrupt, progress is thought of in terms of an ideal city. But the 
    ideal city lies at the center of creation. Therefore, the idea of progress 
    partakes of a spiritual, sociological, or geographical search for the 'center.' 
    The many journey patterns of antiquity and modern times represent...a search 
    for paradise, which is in part regressive. But the vision of paradise is determined 
    and preceded by a state of intense suffering symbolized by the passage through 
    hell, a night journey, or descent into the sea...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sad experience in Egypt produced...the 
    passage across the Red Sea, whose waters opened a gateway to the promised 
    land. The Babylonian exile produced the jeremiads of the prophets and their 
    promise of a messiah; it also produced Daniel's descent into the lion's den 
    and his eschatological vision of the Last Days...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The passion play was a product 
    of Roman domination heaped upon a heritage of oppression. The passage of Jesus 
    through the streets of Jerusalem carrying the burdens of the cross to Calvary 
    symbolically re-enacts the suffering of His people. His resurrection, their 
    hope of deliverance...The legalism and exclusiveness of Mosaic teaching was 
    transcended (fulfilled) on a higher plane. In Christ, the earlier geographical 
    searches for the center had become a spiritual quest--and so remained for 
    some thousand years afterward.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This happened during the 
    Renaissance when a significant social transformation in Europe coincided with 
    the opening of new lands beyond the seas... The new experience which the seafaring 
    adventurers sought had a great deal to do also with the myth of El Dorado 
    (and the Seventh city of Cibola), believed to exist in the interior of the 
    newly discovered Eden...&quot; </font>The Quest For Paradise, Europe and the

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dedicated to the countless clans, 
    tribes and nation of indigenous peoples throughout Mother Earth whose sacred 
    visions, dreams, prayers, songs, wisdom, experience and kind guidance form 
    the Foundation and living reality of the Sacred Tree.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For all the people of the earth, 
    the Creator has planted a Sacred Tree under which they may gather, and there 
    find healing, power, wisdom and security. The roots of this Tree spread deep 
    into the body of Mother Earth. Its branches reach upward like hands praying 
    to Father Sky. The fruits of this Tree are the good things the Creator has 
    given to His people: teachings that show the path to love, compassion, generosity, 
    patience, wisdom, justice, courage, respect, humility and many other gifts.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ancient ones taught us that 
    the life of the Tree is the life of the people. If the people wander far away 
    from the protective shadow of the Tree, if they forget to seek the nourishment 
    of its fruit, or if they should turn against the Tree and attempt to destroy 
    it, great sorrow will fall upon the people. Many will become sick at heart. 
    The people will lose their power. They will cease to dream dreams and see 
    visions. They will begin to quarrel among themselves over worthless trifles. 
    They will become unable to tell the truth and to deal with each other honestly. 
    They will forget how to survive in their own land. Their lives will become 
    filled with anger and gloom. Little by little they will poison themselves 
    and all they touch.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was foretold that these things 
    would come to pass, but that the Tree would never die. And as long as the 
    Tree lives, the people live. It was also foretold that the day would come 
    when the people would awaken, as if from a long drugged sleep; that they would 
    begin, timidly at first but then with great urgency, to search again for the 
    Sacred Tree.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The knowledge of its whereabouts, 
    and of the fruits that adorn its branches have always been carefully guarded 
    and preserved within the minds and hearts of our wise elders and leaders. 
    These humble, loving and dedicated souls will guide anyone who is honestly 
    and sincerely seeking along the path leading to the protecting shadow of the 
    Sacred Tree.</font></p>

  Sacred Tree</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sacred Tree as a symbol of 
    life-giving meaning is of vital importance to the indigenous peoples of the 
    earth. For countless generations it has provided meaning and inspiration for 
    many tribes and nations. The Sacred Tree is a symbol around which lives, religions, 
    beliefs and nations have been organized. It is a symbol of profound depth, 
    capable of providing enough meaning for a lifetime of reflection.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sacred Tree represents life, 
    cycles of time, the earth, and the universe. The meaning of the Sacred Tree 
    reflects the teachings of the Medicine Wheel. The center of the Medicine Wheel 
    is the symbolic center of creation and of the tribe. This meaning is reflected 
    in a song which is sung on behalf of the Sacred Tree chosen for the Sun Dance.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Symbolically, the Sacred Tree represents 
    a gathering place for the many different tribes and peoples of the world. 
    The Sacred Tree provides a place of protection in the world, a place of peace, 
    contemplation, and centering. Like our mother's womb which provided nourishment 
    and protection during the earliest days of our life, the Sacred Tree may be 
    thought of as a womb of protection which gives birth to our values and potentialities 
    as unique human beings.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The process of developing our uniqueness 
    through the teachings of the Sacred Tree gives rise to a vision, not of what 
    we are, but of what we can become. That vision becomes the path toward our 
    wholeness. Thus we see in the symbolic protection of the Sacred Tree the beginning 
    of our wholeness and the emergance of the seed of our potential.&quot;</font></p>
