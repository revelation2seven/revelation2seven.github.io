<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Paul,<br>
  <br>
  Today I turned 63 years old. The numbers 6 and 3 total 9, and that is the number 
  on the Sacred Tree of Life where all things are reconciled. I have a request 
  to make of you. Please think very hard about it. I have been on a long spiritual 
  journey. I have been through many gates. I have many grandchildren, and have 
  sat to pray (both with them and by myself) at many sacred places. And soon I 
  (and many others) will be called upon to make an atonement for the white man, 
  and for all those who have committed violence against others in the earth in 
  the name of God. This morning I woke up with a dream telling me to ask you if 
  I may participate in this year's Dance. My initiation for the things to come 
  began at last year's ceremonies at Pinon, in the sweat lodges, and when I attached 
  eight hemp strings to the upper branches of the Sun dance Tree before it was 
  lifted up. Those ties symbolized my prayers for the coming year (Eight symbolizes 
  renewal) and a request I made to the Great Spirit to completely purify my heart 
  and my mind, to make them free of all imperfections. It would be a great blessing 
  to complete this holy year by bringing myself to the Tree itself. And even more 
  so, by coming near to it in the presence of those who have been near to it for 
  longer than one can recall. <br>
  <br>
  You can see the work I have been doing for almost 30 years now at www.revelation2seven.org. 
  There is a chapter there next to Arizona Sundance entitled A Journey of Atonement. 
  Perhaps it will help you decide. Please pray about it, and then talk to the 
  others who are in charge of such decisions. Thank you. Peace and Love to you 
  and all of yours. Michael Murphy.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<blockquote> 
  <p align="center">About fifteen years ago a man passed me in the crowd at Penn 
    Station in New York City. I am certain that I must have appeared homeless, 
    or heading in that direction. Nan always told me not to appear to others as 
    derelict, and to be mindful of how others reacted to me at first glance. (I 
    have tried to stay as mindful as I possibly can), He turned around and shouted, 
    &quot;Hey, you!&quot; I looked at him and pointed to myself, &quot;me?&quot; 
    &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, walking back, &quot;I am supposed to give something 
    to you.&quot; &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied. 
    He reached into his portfolio case filled with other paintings and handed 
    me this small painting he had done, which I have titled The Troubled Sun. 
    &quot;Thank you,&quot; I said as he turned around and left.</p>

  AND THE WAVES...Matthew 8;24-27</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two parts 
    of the Way: the finding of the Supreme within the heart, through reverent 
    aspiration and obedience; and then the ruling and dominating of the personal 
    self by that new-found Lord. The task is not easy, nor is to be compassed 
    in a day. Difficult will be the struggle against the personal self, its desires 
    and hates, its sense of separateness from others, as possessing separate fortunes 
    and a separate fate. Only the divine power within can meet and master the 
    headstrong will of the personal self, whose minister, Mind, ever suggests 
    subtle and plausible pretexts for disobedience. The contest is age-long, calling 
    for high faith and valor, and a deep patience, which will accept no defeat, 
    and ever renews the fight, even when it seems hopeless.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The incidents and 
    aspects of the battle are here detailed, with eloquence and endless richness 
    of symbol. Every sentence speaks some intimate truth of the contest, describes 
    some landmark of the Way. Only those who have faithfully made the sacrifice 
    and entered on the path can understand how deep and perfect is the insight, 
    the vision of the Way here recorded. They must learn within themselves something 
    of the Peace, which comes after the first great victory over the personal 
    self; of the Silence, which is indeed the voice of the Soul; of that firm 
    Control of the Mind by the Higher Self, so that the Mind, from being unstable 
    and inconstant, shall become steady as an unruffled lake, mirroring at last 
    the wisdom that is from above.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The battle is long 
    and arduous. If renouncing the world, one has entered that battle, yet through 
    the obstinate subtlety of the Mind has won no final Victory, has such a one 
    lost both worlds, giving up this, and yet not finding the other?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This question of Arjuna, 
    Krishna answers by declaring the Law of the Soul. He who has sought the Supreme 
    is guarded by the Supreme, even through the waters of Death. The contest bravely 
    begun will be taken up again and carried on, in days to come, under other 
    skies. None can lose the Way of the Supreme, whose heart is set on that Way 
    in love. For greatest of all powers that make for advance upon the Way is 
    genuine and unfeigned love of the Divine. This is really the heart of faith, 
    of peace, of silence, of control; of all the treasures that are brought forth 
    from the store of divinity for the enrichment of the pure heart. </font>Introduction

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a spiritual significance 
    to all this, and the situation of Arjuna is well chosen to bring out great 
    spiritual truths. He stands for the personal self, beginning to grow conscious 
    of the Higher Self; touched and enkindled with the spiritual light of that 
    Higher Self, yet full of dismay and terror from the realization of what obedience 
    to the Higher Self must mean. The contest of brothers </font>(Cain and Abel, 
    both of whom reside in the same soul)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    is now concentrated within a single nature, the life of a single man. A war 
    must be waged within himself, a war long and arduous, for the life of the 
    Soul. Nothing but high courage, joined with faith and aspiration, makes the 
    contest possible, and even then there will be shrinking and dismay Against 
    the still, small voice of the Soul are arrayed the strong forces of the material 
    nature, the passions, the mind. These are the opposing brothers on the field 
    of the Law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of the same conflict, another teacher, 
    speaking for the Soul, has said: Think not that I am come to send peace on 
    earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at 
    variance against his father </font>(against his old nature)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    and the daughter against her mother </font>(against her old nature)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">,

    And a man's foes </font>(his own thoughts)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    shall be those of his own household. He that loveth father and mother more 
    than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross and followeth 
    after me is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it; and 
    he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The losing of this life that he 
    may find it is the great fratricidal war that opens the door to the Path, 
    and the shrinking and dismay of Arjuna have thus their universal value and 
    significance. He is facing the battle of man, as he grieves there in the chariot, 
    between two armies, while the arrows are already falling. </font>Introduction

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michael, <br>
  Congrats, you can now put 63 on your w</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">intercount. I trust this finds you 
  well wherever you may be..New York? No matter, you'r still on mother earth. 
  Michael, you are not making it easy on me, my brother. I could answer you question 
  and request with one word, but that is not that way of and nature of things. 
  With the short space I have here, let me reiterate what has come down from Chief 
  LookingHorse. He has proclaimed a moritorium on non-native relatives involvement 
  in the 7 sacred rites because of the sacrilege of Great Spirits ceremonies for 
  the lakota, nakota, and dakota nations. This was released to the media with 
  grave results. Non-the-less, with overwhelming negative response from the non-native 
  community, Chief Looking Horse has no regret in making such a bold statement 
  because of a unusual high number of unfortunate incidents by Natives also in 
  ceremonies. I won't go into details for obvious reasons other then to say that 
  his instruction has come from a higher source than his own. In which case, I 
  and my relatives have chosen to honor the traditional protocols of no non natives 
  involvement as Dancers. Now, the other part of this is that we all need to work 
  even harder to promote unity and peace. This has open a whole new platform for 
  interpretations of 1.who is s native american 2. what of federal recognition 
  3. who decides 4. etc. <br>
  <br>
  At this point, my brother, it is heart wrenching to not deny, but to ask for 
  all our relations understanding in this crucial issue come to light. We are 
  under much attack for this and it does not cast a good light on us, even to 
  point of some choosing to make a political and legal point based on first amendment.<br>
  <br>
  We are really working with our dancers now to limit even native dancers as many 
  really don't have the faintest of what they are doing. It also concerns health 
  and other issues. What to happen? ...we step back some and pray on these things. 
  Until then, we ask for your patience and understanding. <br>
  <br>
  I am aware of the many sincere few who really know the what, whys, and how of 
  sundancing. It is a life time commitment to do for all creations. In other words, 
  one must sacrifice his life so that others may live not only in words-prayers, 
  but actions. I and about 5 others of over 300 dancers at Pinon are responsible 
  for year round ceremonies, preparations, fundraisings, caretaking, community 
  outreaches, education, and other activities that require a great deal of personal 
  expenses, etc, etc. We only see others at sundance time ...unfortunate. <br>
  <br>
  Well, one could go on but why? I have to really thank you for your intentions 
  to dance at my mothers land. Just the thought you must have given to it means 
  more than someone who crashes our dance on last day, pierces, and struts his 
  stuff for all to see....just because he is native!.<br>
  <br>
  In your mind, you must have danced many times. Even in your sacred dreams too 
  where spirit has no boundary. I will pray much on this as I go up to Arvol's 
  place in two weeks to fast and pray. I am much trouble about the disharmony 
  of our ways, but there are so much we have to be thankful for too.<br>
  <br>
  This will be my sincere words this day, my relative, that we may both have understandings 
  of the spirit mysteries of our time. Seeing is believing, but greater is one's 
  faith, when he believes and doesn't have to see it. All our contributions are 
  equally great in ceremonies, from the Chief to the ones cleaning the commodes. 
  Thank you, Please stay in touch. <br>
