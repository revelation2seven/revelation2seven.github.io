<p><b>SIGNS OF THE TIMES</b></p>
<p>&#147;My twelfth descendant will disappear in such a way that he will not be 
  seen at all. There will come a time when there shall remain nothing but a name 
  from Islam. And, there shall remain nothing but a trace from the Qur'an. At 
  that time Allah will permit him to revolt and through him Allah will reinforce 
  Islam and revive it.&#148; - Muhammad al-Khatam al-Anbiyah</p>
<p>Notes: Muntakhab al-athar, p. 98. </p>
<p>Two years ago when i wrote the first incarnation of this text i was overwhelmed 
  with the profundity of these two eclipses occurring this soon. It was not lost 
  on me that we have all seen so many signs fulfilled in such a short a time. 
  Much of what i wrote presumed that the reader already accepted the fact that 
  we are living in the time of fulfillment of the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (Revelation). 
  If one is dead set against believing that, then it is unlikely they will ever 
  accept anything to the contrary, no matter how compelling the evidence. It assumed 
  that the reader was not averse to the notion that an end to this deviant global 
  society WILL indeed come. As well it assumed that one believed in the fulfillment 
  of prophecy itself.</p>
<p>The problem that i found was that many - even those who profess Islam as their 
  din - in their hearts remain skeptical of the reality of prophecy. Some are 
  so shocked to hear that there are these things transpiring that synchronize 
  with prophecy from thousands of years ago, that they shut out the relevant facts 
  and write off the connection as mere coincidence after coincidence.</p>
<p>Prophecies abound from the 14 Ma'sumin regarding the &quot;end of the Age&quot; 
  or Zaman. Later in this text we will explore just what this &quot;Age&quot; 
  is, and what the next one is, in the understanding of the Eastern Hindu and 
  Buddhist traditions. But before we get to where we're going, we need some preparation 
  in the form assuring that the reader understands that without question we are 
  living in a time, THE time, that was prophesied so long ago. </p>
<p>The Sixth Imam Ja'far As-Sadiq is recorded as saying:</p>
<p><b>&quot;The believer, in the time of Qa'im, while in the east will be able 
  to see his brother in the west and he who is in the west will be able to see 
  his brother in the east&quot;</b></p>
<p>Notes: Az-Zanjani, Aqa'id, p. 255</p>
<p>In what other age besides this one could such a thing occur? With video cameras, 
  televisions and now even cell phones with cameras a commonplace reality, this 
  prophecy is fulfilled to the letter. As well, just a few of the literally HUNDREDS 
  of signs that have been fulfilled include:</p>
<p><b>&quot;Camels will no longer be used as a means of transport; People will 
  ride on saddles that aren't saddles.&quot; We see this fulfilled with the advent 
  of the automobile.</b></p>
<p><b>&quot;The distance on earth will become short.&quot;</b> We see this fulfilled 
  with modern forms of transportation like automobiles, trains and airplanes. 
  Far distances are spanned in a short period of time.</p>
<p><b>&quot;Horses will not be used in wars.&quot;</b> This too has been replaced 
  by modern forms of warfare, airplanes, guerrilla warfare and the like.</p>
<p><b>&quot;The Jews will gather again to live in Bilad Canaan.&quot;</b> This 
  of course has proven one of the most central matters to the instability of world 
  peace. What seemed like an impossibility actually came to pass.</p>
<p><b>&quot;Very tall buildings will be built.&quot;</b> This one is perhaps an 
  UNDERSTATEMENT it was fulfilled so accurately. </p>
<p>&quot;Allah will send a disease to fornicators that will have no cure.&quot; 
  We see a global crisis in AIDS as well as in rampant Sexually Transmitted Diseases 
  in general.</p>
<p><b>&quot;Men will pass by people's graves and say: 'Would that I were in his 
  place'.&quot;</b> Of course in no other recorded generation has there been the 
  epidemic of suicides at the rate that we now see.</p>
<p><b>&quot;Two large groups of people will fight one another, and there will 
  be many casualties; they will both be following the same religion.&quot;</b> 
  This occurred in World War Two, where both the Nazi's and Britain along with 
  the United States (Yajuj and Majuj), both claimed to be the true representatives 
  of Christianity.</p>
<p>&quot;Women will be wearing clothes but not wearing clothes.&quot; The popular 
  western culture of the day propagandizes clothes that are barely coverings. 
  While there are some somewhat modest women, the majority of the youth dress 
  little different than prostitutes on the street. </p>
<p>Saoban reported that Muhammad said: &quot;It is near that the nations will 
  call one another against you just as the eaters call one another at their dishes. 
  Some body enquired: Shall we be few at that time? He said: No, you will be numerous 
  at that time, but you will be so many rubbishes like the rubbishes of a torrent. 
  Allah will then certainly take away the fear of you from the minds of your enemies 
  and will certainly throw weakness into your hearts. Some body enquired: O Rasul'ullah, 
  what will be (the cause of) weakness? He replied: Love of this world and dislike 
  for death.&quot;</p>
<p>Notes: Abu Dawud 24 </p>
<p>With these, just a few of the Ahadith on the signs of these times we are living 
  in, borne in mind, the Muslim should not have a problem accepting that the Ma'sumin 
  were talking about this very age, <b>the transition between what the Vedas called 
  the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; and the &quot;Saya Yuga.&quot; </b></p>
<p>It is not expected that the heart of every kuffar who reads this will be turned. 
  However, it is expected that with this the Mu'minin will appreciate the urgency 
  of preparation and mobilization for the Inevitable.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IT ALL MEANS</b></p>
<p>The analogy that has often occurred to me was of a man jumping off of a cliff. 
  When he first jumps he is plunging at the lowest velocity. However, as he continues 
  in his descent he picks up speed. So too is it with the near global Beast that 
  we find ourselves living within. It was that way with the build up of technology, 
  with the spread of global colonialism and warfare, and it is that way too with 
  moral indifference and decadence. This global Beast and the societies that it 
  manifests within, are set on the course to Hell, full speed ahead. <b>As they 
  approach their destination, like the man who approaches the ground after having 
  jumped off a cliff, the speed and intensity of the signs of these times increase 
  in number of occurrences and in specificity</b>. </p>
<p>So when i was prompted, so to speak, to contact the astronomical associations 
  that i did in regards to this matter, i was somewhat skeptical myself. i did 
  not expect to hear that this was something so soon. i did not expect to hear 
  that the first time <b>the double eclipse of Shahar Ramadan</b> occurred - since 
  that month of fasting was implemented for the Ummah - was when the 12th Imam 
  was <b>28 years</b> old. Not only is this significant that it occurred first 
  within his lifetime (since fasting in the month of Ramadan was instituted),<b> 
  but at the age of 28, whose mystical implications are undoubtedly not lost on 
  the `urafa</b>. Moreover, i NEVER expected that there were prophecies <b>that 
  foretold that the very dates of the 2003 Ramadan eclipses</b>, <b>and stated 
  that this alignment of dates in the Holy Month of Ramadan was the first in the 
  history of Heaven and Earth. This will be explored in depth as we continue</b>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p align="center"><b>From Sun up to Sun down...The Cosmic Month of Ramadan...Malachi, 
  chapter 4.</b></p>
<p>When the first communiqu&eacute; was sent out about this finding i was overwhelmed 
  and in a state of apocalyptic fervor. That is not to say that i now believe 
  one word of what i wrote was factually inaccurate. However, i do recognize that 
  i was completely unaware as to how many people would read the text and how global 
  of an impact it would have (both positive and negative).</p>
<p>When i began my investigation, i found literally NOTHING on the web about it. 
  i found literally NOTHING in print about it, save the ahadith that are recorded 
  herein. Yet in time many would devise sites that were purporting to defuse the 
  fervor that began with this text. They would lean heavily on the quote from 
  Kitab al-Irshad expressing a reverse order of eclipses, and disregard all other 
  ahadith that disagreed with that narration and agreed with those hadith that 
  do not speak of things that are LITERALLY &quot;Science Fiction&quot; (since 
  a reversed order of eclipses would require an entire rearrangement of the Galaxy.</p>
<p>As well, some such individuals would note the frequent PARTIAL double eclipses 
  and say &quot;See these things happen ALL the time.&quot; (2 Peter 3:1-7). They 
  could not have been further from the truth. But all of this is explained and 
  has been widely accepted by Mu'minin all over the world. (<i>Mu'min...</i>The 
  believers, as opposed to the <i>Kafir </i>or those who repudiate God and His 
  messenger...Malachi 3 and 4). It is not hard to believe this unless you are 
  trying to find fault with it, and trying to explain it away. </p>
<p>i did not realize that there were so many who would go to no ends to convince 
  people that this was not going to happen. Yet at the same time ALL of these 
  critics have been silent in confronting me personally. Usually you will find 
  websites or fatawat that say this is not true. They have not confronted me to 
  hear my response. They assume that what i wrote originally was all the information 
  that i had on the subject. Thus, if they found anything that fell outside of 
  the spectrum of what i introduced, then they assumed this was a hole in the 
  text, rather than something that i simply had omitted out of urgency to get 
  the message out to the Ummah and specifically to the Mu'minin. </p>
<p>However, we should not expect fair dealing from the majority of so-called `ulama. 
  These same are the ones who racialistically conceal the ethnicity of the A'immah 
  after Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq, <b>those who teach that only people of certain ancestries 
  can marry others of the same</b>. Those same do not truly want the Imam to rise 
  (though they do not admit this to others, or in most cases even to themselves). 
  Those same are devouring the Khums that he and his Jaysh are due for the GLOBAL 
  REVOLUTION. Those fat-cat, so-called `ulama do not want to give half the khums 
  to the poor and the other have to the Revolution and Dawah of Al-Qa'im. They 
  would rather spend it on their own vain pursuits and luxuries.</p>
<p>Some `ulama are genuine though, and to them we give our support. Naming them 
  is not necessary. As `Isa al-Masih (Jesus) said, <b>&quot;You will know a tree 
  by its fruits.&quot;</b> <b>So too do we know the true `ulama by their deeds</b>. 
  Who is genuinely spreading Islam? Who is supporting the poor? Who is backing 
  the cause of the oppressed? These are your `ulama, those of knowledge who not 
  only READ the words of Hadith, but take them to heart.</p>
<p>This text reflects additional information that i held back for one reason or 
  another at the time of authorship. Insha'Allah you will find that this further 
  strengthens your Iman of the imminence <b>of the Imam al-Mahdi's</b> Rise (of 
  which no one knows the specific time), and further shatters the critics who 
  would love to relegate the Rise to the hypothetical, and presumably DISTANT 
  future; one where they are not required to take action, choose a side, and prepare 
  for battle.</p>
<p> With that, i present these truths for your edification...</p>
<p>Al-Yamani</p>
<p>While some of the minor signs have been relayed above, there are signs that 
  we are told bear more significance than others. The topic of this text itself 
  is perhaps the greatest of all of these signs, <b>as it is said to bear the 
  weight of Ten signs itself</b>. Among some of the other major signs is the sign 
  of &quot;Al-Yamani&quot; (the Yemenite).</p>
<p>&quot;There will be three appearances in one year, one month and one day. The 
  Sufyani, the Khurasani and the Yamani. The standard of guidance will not be 
  among them, except the standard of the Yamani, because he will summon (people) 
  to the truth.&quot; - Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq</p>
<p>Could it be that the world famous Yemenite `Usama Bin Ladin, is in fact this 
  Yamani who was said to fight against the Sufyanic system, and against the nations 
  of Yajuj and Majuj? (Britain and America). The initial Shi'a reaction would 
  be that this could not be; that the man is a &quot;Wahhabi&quot; like we are 
  told by the Western propaganda machine. But in reality he is not a Hanbali &quot;Wahhabi,&quot; 
  he is a follower of Shafi'i fiqh. He blessed the Ahl'ul-Bayt in his speeches, 
  those same speeches that the western media will not air the entire translation 
  of. The FBI recently said that they have recent UNRELEASED footage of him by 
  a chalk board that has ahadith about Al-Qa'im on it. They fear who this &quot;Mahdi&quot; 
  is that he was expecting and writing about, because they fear he will be far 
  worse for them than Yamani, and that Yamani will team up with him. </p>
<p>&quot;U.S. military intelligence experts are studying a video clip of Osama 
  bin Laden in which he stands before a dry-erase board with an Arabic phrase 
  written upon it &#150; &quot;awaited enlightened one,&quot; reports Joseph Farah's 
  G2 Bulletin. &quot;No one who has seen the video is quite certain of the meaning 
  or the context. But, the Hadith, a collection of Islamic holy writings that 
  supplement the Quran, predicts a messianic figure will arise in the last days 
  of history. This &quot;Mahdi,&quot; along with the &quot;Prophet Jesus,&quot; 
  will lead the believers to victory over the infidels. </p>
<p>&quot;The video raises the question of whether bin Laden sees himself as this 
  Mahdi or if he is expecting another to arise and lead. Either way, the addition 
  of a dimension of Islamic prophecy to the global terror war may seriously complicate 
  matters for planners in the West.&quot; Is bin Laden the 'Mahdi'?: http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=34469 
  As we see from the article, there is no data that supports the notion that Bin 
  Ladin believes he is the Mahdi. Rather, there IS intelligence that says he is 
  actively planning and coordinating his efforts in conjunction with his own expectations 
  of the Mahdi....</p>
<p><b>THE SIGN EQUAL TO TEN WEIGHTY SIGNS</b></p>
<p><b>&quot;At length, when the sight is dazed, and the moon is buried in darkness, 
  and the sun and moon are joined together - the Day of That will Man say: 'Where 
  is the refuge?'&quot;</b> Al-Qur'an, Sura 75:7-10</p>
<p><b>Allah gives a sign that Mahdi will be among us when a double eclipse occurs 
  in the month of Ramadan.</b></p>
<p>&quot;It has been reported from Abu Ja'far that <b>the event of the Mahdi's 
  appearance shall be attended by two clear signs which will carry with them the 
  weight of ten strong signs. These are the solar and the lunar eclipses; and 
  a similar sign has never happened ever since Adam came upon this planet.&quot;</b></p>
<p>Notes: Ikmal al-Din, p. 361 </p>
<p>This Hadith is key to understanding the matter of the Double Eclipses. Where 
  as Shaykh Mufid notes in Kitab al-Irshad, that Imam Al-Baqir is reported as 
  claiming that the Double Eclipse itself will be the sign that has not existed 
  since Adam was sent down upon the Earth, other Ahadith such as this one above 
  tell of the Double Eclipses being one sign and the sign that has not happened 
  since Adam came to Earth is ANOTHER. </p>
<p>Unlike the four madahib of the non-Shi'a sects we do not hold that our Ahadith 
  are &quot;Sahih&quot; though some sources like Nahj'ul-Balaghah are taken relatively 
  so. <b>But when we have two slightly different ahadith</b>, we are not to disregard 
  them both, nor are we to absolutely regard them both. Rather, <b>we are to investigate 
  them, hold them to the light of Reason (`Aql) and take them with the proverbial 
  &quot;grain of salt.&quot;</b></p>
<p>So when Shaykh Mufid reports rare accounts that the order of the eclipses is 
  reversed from what is astrologically possible, it does not mean we should dismiss 
  this notion out rightly, but it does mean that we should view it within the 
  context of being a MINORITY of reports along those lines in comparison to the 
  ones that claim the times of the eclipse are in accordance with the Nature Order 
  of things, and that the sign that has not happened since Adam was send down 
  upon the Earth are two different things. Thus, i do not find it unreasonable 
  at all to focus on the bulk of the Ahadith which are in fact scientifically 
  sound, and to pass over the Kitab al-Irshad narration that even admits itself 
  it is incomprehensible. <b>Taken as a whole, this text most certainly makes 
  the case that the prophesied Double Eclipse of the Month of Ramadan were speaking 
  of this very year and this very month of fasting that we find ourselves in now.</b></p>
<p>Nonetheless, there need be no confusion about the matter. There is a specific 
  alignment of the Eclipses of the the Holy Month of Ramadan that Imam al-Baqir 
  (as) said has never happened before. <b>That alignment is occurring in the month 
  of Ramadan 2003 on the 8th and 23rd of November</b>.</p>
<p>Non-Shi'a hadith tells us the following: <b>&quot;Of our Mahdi there are two 
  signs which have never taken place ever since the Earth and the Heaven came 
  into existence. One is that in the month of Ramadan the moon shall be eclipsed 
  on the first of its nights and the sun in the middle of its days, and such a 
  sign has never occurred ever since the creation of the Earth and the Heaven.&quot;</b></p>
<p>Notes: Dar al-Qutni, vol. 8, p. 188 </p>
<p>Dar&#146;ul-Qutni reports to have heard from Imam Muhammad Baqir the following 
  statement: <b>&#147;Our Mahdi shall be accompanied by two signs the like of 
  which have not happened since the creation of the Heaven and the Earth, namely, 
  that in a certain month of Ramadan there will be an eclipse of the moon on the 
  first of the three nights usual for such eclipses and in the same month in the 
  second of three days assigned for the solar eclipse there will occur an eclipse 
  of the sun.&#148;</b></p>
<p>Thus, we see that there are not only ahadith that list the Double Eclipse as 
  a singular sign and the sign that has not occurred since the time of Adam (as). 
  Dar al-Qutni and Ikmal al-Din reports that the timing of the Lunar Eclipse on 
  the first of the three days assigned for it and the Solar Eclipse on the second 
  of the three assigned for it is a specific timing of the Double Eclipse of Shahar 
  Ramadan that has not occurred EVER, not merely since Adam an-Nabi (as) came 
  down to Earth, but since Heaven and Earth themselves were created. Later this 
  will be explored down to the last detail; demonstrating that the 13th of the 
  Month of Ramadan (8th of November), and 28th of the Month of Ramadan (23rd of 
  November), are in fact the first of the three nights usual for lunar eclipses 
  and and the 23rd is the second of thee days assigned for solar eclipses.</p>
<p>The specifications for the dating of the eclipses in the reversed order hadith 
  are erroneous, as the timing during the month of Ramadan that the non-Shi'a 
  version, and a narration in Kitab al-Irshad, states is a physical impossibility. 
  First of all the moon could not be told to be eclipsed on the first night, since 
  it is virtually invisible then anyway. Even if it did eclipse then, this would 
  be a fruitless sign since it is nearly invisible at that time anyway. An eclipse 
  at that time of the month would be totally invisible. No human eye would be 
  able to see this sign of the darkened moon of the first night, and yet it is 
  given as the primary sign of the advent of the return of our Imam al-Mahdi.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)</font>...

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to rabbinic tradition 
    Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyarcanus was a disciple of Yochannan ben Zakkai, who was 
    said to be a disciple of Hillel, the great expositor of the Torah in the time 
    of Christ. We shall see that Yochannan ben Zakkai and the Essene, John (Yochannan) 
    the Baptist (the &quot;son of Zachariah&quot;), were one and the same, or 
    rather that the Yochannan of rabbinic fame acquired the name after the Kabbalistic 
    doctrines of the early Church passed into Judaism via the original Schimon 
    bar Yonah (Simon Peter) and others, and that this Rabbi Eliezer was one of 
    chief agents of these transmissions. His association with the Essenes, the 
    first Christians, and possibly with Paul (Elisha Ben Abuyah), was the eventual 
    cause of his censure and excommunication from the rabbinic circle. Nevertheless, 
    in a work ascribed to him many centuries later entitled The Chapters of Rabbi 
    Eliezer the Great, there are two chapters dedicated to the course of the Sun 
    and the Moon, and another concerned with the intercalation periods between 
    them both...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ostensibly these chapters seem 
    primarily concerned with assuring that these two luminous bodies appear in 
    the heavens at the time they are supposed to, marking the times and the seasons 
    in their proper order, so that Passover is always observed in the spring of 
    the year, and the High Holy Days of the Seventh month are always observed 
    when the Sun is falling in the West at the time of the Autumn equinox. But 
    a closer examination reveals these chapters to be concerned, not specifically 
    with heavenly bodies (although the precept always holds: As Above so below), 
    but with the conjunction of the Male and Female principles in their appointed 
    times. In these chapters we are told that the Sun's path through the planetary 
    spheres is a cycle of 28 years, bringing it back to its place of origin again--a 
    cycle that has continued since the time these two great lights were created 
    together in the Genesis account. (Genesis 1:16). And that the cycle of the 
    Moon is 21 years, before it returns to its place of origin in respect to the 
    other planets again. Starting out together, according to this purely apocryphal 
    (though neverthless accurate prophetic) account, it means that the two must 
    come together every (28 X 21) 588 years. Ten times 588 years is 5,880 years. 
    Likewise, when we calculate the times according to their Jubilees (periods 
    of 49 years each, as we are commanded to at Leviticus 25:8), we see that the 
    whole time of the Adamic epic (from Genesis to Revelation) is also (120 X 
    49), or 5,880 years. And in this circle we discover three periods of 40 Jubilees 
    each: a period of 40 Jubilees between the time of Adam to the time of Abraham, 
    Isaac, and Jacob, 40 Jubilees more to the time of Christ, and 40 Jubilees, 
    or 1,960 years, from the time of Christ to our own, and to another of the 
    many cosmic events that are falling in place together at this time in history, 
    one that has everything to do with the joining together in our time of the 
    two sides of the Tree of Life--Male and Female, &quot;Christian and Jew&quot; 
    (True Muslims)...not to fail to mention, Things Above with Things Below.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And neither may our strictly literalist 
    brethren go to calculating in order to prove such things incorrect--(jot, 
    tittle, seconds, minutes, hours, days...)--for all the times and events of 
    God have their own complexities, and their own catching up with each other 
    to do. Be sure that all things are locking in place together, but also that 
    Divine Grace still presides over the wheels of Time, and over the whole process 
    of revelation:</font></p>
  <p><i><b>&quot;</b>'For the vision is yet for the appointed time. At the end 
    it shall speak, and not lie. Though it lags toward the moment; it will not 
    be belied.'</i><b> (Habakkuk 2:1-3)...</b></p>
  <p><b>This refers to the fact that the final moment (as in the birth-process 
    itself) may be protracted beyond anything the prophets have foretold, for 
    God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform...This is addressed to 
    the men of truth, those who carry out the law (Torah), who do not relax from 
    serving the truth even though the final moment be long drawn out. Assuredly, 
    all the times appointed by God will come in due course, even as He has determined 
    in His inscrutable wisdom.&quot; </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

<p>These two phenomena of the lunar and solar eclipses <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(conjunctions)</font> 
  will take place in a much different order. As the non-Shi'a hadith says it, 
  with the solar eclipse occurring in mid-month, this would require the moon to 
  suddenly double its speed of movement after the onset of the month! To believe 
  not only that the moon would suddenly double its speed after the onset of the 
  month is unreasonable enough in itself. However, coupled with the fact that 
  a lunar eclipse on the first night of the month of Ramadan would be physically 
  impossible to see, we must conclude that the scientifically unfounded version 
  of this Hadith is unreasonable and the portion of it referring to the dates 
  in the month of the eclipse must be rejected as plainly unscientific and unreasonable. 
  <b>Imam `Ali ar-Riza tells us that we must understand Islam through Reason:</b></p>
<p>&quot;The greatest of miracles of Allah is the human mind. It allows ideas 
  to be thought through and reasoned out. Islam appeals to human reason. Man must 
  accept Allah through reason and not through miracles.&quot;</p>
<p>Muhammad ar-Rasul'ullah has said: &quot;Almighty Allah has endowed upon mankind 
  nothing better than reason. Sleep of a wise man is better than the waking hours 
  of an ignorant. Rest of a wise man is better than the movement of ignorant. 
  Allah has not send any Nabi or Rasul without first perfecting his reason; and 
  his reason stands superior to all the reasons of (the people of) his community...</p>
<p>&quot;No creature can ever discharge his obligations to Allah unless he comprehends 
  those (obligations). All the worshippers weighted together can not reach the 
  height of excellence of a wise man. The man of reason who are the possessors 
  of understanding minds about whom Allah said: &quot;...But none will grasp the 
  Message except men of understanding.&quot; Al-Qur'an, Sura 2:269, 3:7</p>
<p>Usul al-Kafi, part 1 Hadith #11</p>
<p>So, following in the study of astronomy that Imam Sadiq also studied and taught, 
  it is unreasonable to imagine that the scientifically unacceptable scheduling 
  of these eclipses will occur in the order said by some narrations. As well, 
  since Imam Al-Baqir mentions this sign in this way, in MOST versions of the 
  Hadith, yet make no mention of the reversed dates of the eclipses in their relationship 
  to the month itself, <b>then it would be REASONABLE to accept only that the 
  sign is that of the double eclipse during the Holy month of Ramadan.</b></p>
<p>The Double Eclipse is scheduled for November the 8th and approximately November 
  23rd of 2003. <b>Fasting for the Month of Ramadan of 2003</b> began approximately 
  on the 27th of October to approximately the 27th of November (depending upon 
  what part of the world you are in). <b>The Month of Ramadan being a 30 day lunar 
  period, both the eclipse of November the 8th and November the 23rd will fall 
  in this Holy Month</b>. The November 8th Lunar eclipse will be visible from: 
  Europe, South West Asia, Africa and America. The November 23rd Solar eclipse 
  will be visible from Antarctica and the South Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Fadl ibn Yasar heard Imam Baqir saying: &quot;When our Qa'im rises he will 
  face so much difficulty from the people, that even An-Nabi during the period 
  of Jahiliyah (pre-Islamic times) did not face.&quot; Fadl asked: &quot;Why should 
  that be so?&quot; The Imam said: &#147;When An-Nabi was appointed people worshipped 
  stones and wood. <b>However, when our Qa'im arises people will interpret the 
  ordinances of Allah against his interpretation, and will argue with him and 
  dispute by means of the Qur'an</b>. By Allah, the justice of the Qa'im will 
  enter inside their homes, just as the heat and the cold enter them.&#148; </p>
<p>Notes: Ithbat al-hudat, Vol. 7, p. 86. </p>
<p><b>It is said that Al-Mahdi will have a much more difficult task than Muhammad, 
  because he will be confronted with the argumentative dogma of 1,400 years of 
  subjective and cultural interpretation of a Din that the masses have only learned 
  of second hand. It is for this reason that Ahadith tells us that the Arabs will 
  struggle with Al-Mahdi</b>. </p>
<p><b>&#147;When the Qa'im emerges he will come with a new Commission, a new Book, 
  a new conduct and a new Judgment, which will be strenuous for the Arabs. His 
  work is nothing but to fight, and no one will be spared. He will not be afraid 
  of any blame in the execution of his duty.&#148;</b> - Imam Ja'far As-Sadiq</p>
<p>Notes: Ithbat al-hudat, Vol. 7, p. 83. </p>
<p>Imam Sadiq has made the aforementioned role of the Mahdi explicit: <b>&quot;When 
  the Qa'im rises he will emulate the conduct of the Prophet, except that he will 
  elaborate the traditions of Muhammad</b>.&quot; </p>
<p>Bihar al-anwar, Vol. 52, p. 347. </p>
<p>Imam Sadiq relates: <b>&#147;When our Qa'im arises he will call people anew 
  to Islam, guiding them to the old thing from which people have turned away. 
  He will be called Mahdi because he will guide people to the thing from which 
  they have been separated. He will be called Qa'im because he will be commanded 
  to establish the truth.&#148;</b> </p>
<p>Notes: Kashf al-ghumma, Vol. 3, p. 264; Mufid, Irshad, p. 240, 343. </p>
<p><b>As Shi'a, we clearly believe that Imam Al-Mahdi will bring a new Kitab </b>(a 
  new Book)<b>, and a new Shari'ah</b>. However, if there were any group in Islam 
  that did not have severe misunderstandings and false dogmatic interpretations 
  of the Din then this would hardly be necessary. </p>
<p>Imam Sadiq says: &#147;I can witness the Qa'im wearing the particular garment 
  and taking out the letter of the Prophet sealed with a golden seal, and after 
  breaking the seal he reads aloud to the people. The people disperse from him 
  as the sheep do from the shepherd. And no one besides his wazir (vizier) and 
  eleven chiefs remain with him. Then people begin to search for a reformer everywhere. 
  But, since they do not find anyone besides him who can help them, they rush 
  towards him. By Allah, I know what the Qa'im is telling them which they refuse 
  to acknowledge.&#148; </p>
<p>Bihar al-anwar, Vol. 52, p. 326 </p>
<p>The rules binding upon the average people will not be necessary, nor incumbent 
  upon the Imam Al-Mahdi. </p>
<p>&#147;Two cases of bloodshed are permissible in Islam. <b>But no one executes 
  the divine ordinance in those two cases until Allah sends the Qa'im from the 
  Ahl'ul-Bayt who can execute Allah's injunction in those cases without requiring 
  any witnesses:</b> one is the case of a married man committing adultery who 
  will be <b>stoned</b> by him; and the other is the case of a person refusing 
  to pay the Zakat.&#148; - Imam Sadiq said </p>
<p>Notes: Bihar al-Anwar p. 325 </p>
<p>In another tradition Imam Sadiq said: &quot;When the Qa'im from the family 
  of Muhammad appears he will judge among people without requiring witnesses in 
  the manner of Dawud and Sulaiman (David and Solomon).&quot; </p>
<p>Notes: Bihar Al-Anwar p. 320.</p>
<p>With these things considered, it is not difficult to understand how such mass 
  opposition to the Mahdi will occur. <b>Al-Imam Al-Qa'im will tell people what 
  their &quot;itching ears&quot; DO NOT long to hear. For that reason the masses 
  who profess Islam with their lips will oppose him. Furthermore, it is for that 
  reason that so many who profess Islam with their lips, but cling only to the 
  traditions they were taught as part of their culture</b> (and not part of their 
  sincere SUBMISSION to Allah). <b>It is for that reason that these same people 
  will do anything within their power to deny the fulfillment of the Ayat'ul-Mahdi</b> 
  .</p>
<p><b>WILL THIS RETURN BE PHYSICAL?</b></p>
<p>Generally it is understood from Ahadith that this will be the primary sign 
  that Imam Al-Mahdi has returned. However, i do not wish to speculate as to whether 
  or not this means he will be physically visible. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(For 
  both He--The Divine One--who sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all 
  of one...Hebrews 2:11). </font>Nonetheless, in all likelihood that is the case, 
  as has been understood from Ahadith from the beginning. However, this does not 
  mean that he will return saying &quot;i am Al-Mahdi.&quot; In all likelihood 
  he will keep his identity a secret, at least at the beginning, or else the governments 
  of the world (and the masses who will be offended by him), would simply send 
  people to assassinate him. We are told that the majority of the Ummah will reject 
  him. We are told by Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq that &quot;the Arabs will struggle 
  with him,&quot; and that his teachings will be difficult for them to accept. 
  We are told that 40,000 Ulama will die at the hands of the Mahdi and his Shi'a.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(What 
  kind of death)?</font> These are not small waves the man will be making in the 
  Ummah.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>One Hadith tells of a delegation of Muslimin who are sent to ask him if he 
  is the Mahdi, and when asked he DENIES that he is Al-Qaim. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(John 
  1:19-27; Luke 3:15-18). </font>Later the group who asked him returns to those 
  who commissioned them to go to ask him. They tell those who sent them that he 
  denied being the Mahdi. Then those who sent them said &quot;Now we KNOW that 
  he MUST be the Mahdi!&quot; Those charlatans who parade themselves around for 
  praise and self aggrandizement, openly professing that they are the &quot;Mahdi&quot; 
  have in fact singled themselves out as the dajjalin that they in actuality are. 
  For the TRUE nature of the TRUE Imam is not one of self praise and self glory. 
  Rather, as the Hadith says, &quot;His mission is nothing but to fight.&quot; 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Revelation 12)</font>.</p>
<p>Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq has explained: &quot;That which makes the condition of 
  the Master of the Command (the twelfth Imam) resemble Yusuf is that in spite 
  of being mature and wise, and in spite of having associated with him before, 
  Yusuf's brothers could not recognize him when they came to him [in Egypt] until 
  he introduced himself to them. Moreover, in spite of the fact that the distance 
  that existed between Yusuf and Yaqub was no more than eighteen days, Yaqub had 
  no information about him. Then why are these people denying that Allah can do 
  a similar thing for Hu's Proof, the Master of the Command? He too can interact 
  with people, walk around their market place, sit on their carpets and still 
  they would not recognize him! He would continue to do that until Allah permits 
  him to introduce himself.&quot; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notes: Bihar al-Anwar, Volume 52 p. 154.</p>
<p>So we must realize that in all likelihood he will not advertise the fact that 
  he is the Mahdi at first, but will rather call people to his cause of revival 
  of Islam, and Jihad against kufr and oppression. <b>May Allah help us all to 
  recognize him when he rises!</b></p>
<p>&quot;Ilyas Al-Injil&quot;: <b>UNDERSTANDING THE COVERT NATURE OF THE RISE</b></p>
<p>Like Idris ibn Yared and the 12th Imam, Elijah or &quot;Ilyas,&quot; attained 
  immortality. From a &quot;Jewish&quot; perspective there are about five recorded 
  people in the Tanakh who attained such a state. Muslims traditionally agree 
  with Jews definitively on both Idris and Ilyas. The Book of Malachi in the Tanakh 
  closes with a prophecy that &quot;Eliyahu&quot; would return &quot;before the 
  coming of the Great and Terrible Day of YHWH.&quot; It further goes on that 
  &quot;he will turn the hearts&quot; of men or a great curse would follow. <br>
  &quot;Remember the Torah of Moshe my servant, which I commanded to him in Chorev 
  for all Yisra'el, even statutes and ordinances. Behold, I will send you Eliyahu 
  Ha'Nevi before the great and terrible day of the YHWH comes. He will turn the 
  hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their 
  fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.&quot; - Mal'akhi (Malachi) 
  3:22-24.</p>
<p> The P'rushim (Pharisees), disbelieved that Yahya was in fact Ilyas, because 
  they tried to ensnare him regarding this issue. In this age where the Ayat'ul-Mahdi 
  will come to pass and we will be affirmed that prophecy has been fulfilled and 
  the Imam is actively present among us in the capacity of his raja, we can expect 
  that this will most certainly be the case. In fact the Mahdi will not be like 
  the Imposters who have come and gone like the tides - advancing then receding. 
  He will not base his Movement and the New Shariah that will be revealed through 
  him by saying &quot;everyone listen to me because i am Al-Mahdi.&quot; Rather, 
  he will be like Yahya was.</p>
<p> The P'rushim came to Yahya (John) and asked him if he was &quot;Ha'Nevi&quot; 
  meaning the coming Prophet Muhammad. Yahya said no. Then they asked him if he 
  was &quot;Mashiach&quot; meaning `Isa Al-Masih and again he replied no. Then 
  they asked if he was Ilyas making his raja' and he said &quot;i am not&quot;.&quot;ani 
  ayn.&quot; This however, was a declarative statement vastly different than if 
  he would have meant &quot;no, i am not.&quot; If he meant &quot;no, i am not 
  Eliyahu&quot; when he said &quot;i am not&quot; then he would have said &quot;ani 
  lo&quot;.</p>
<p>However, by saying &quot;i am not&quot; (ani ayn) he chose his words carefully. 
  The interesting thing about the words &quot;Ani&quot; and &quot;Ayn&quot; is 
  that they are the same tri-consonantal roots, different only in the sequence 
  of ordering. There is a mystical secret in this. That is that true Existence 
  of Self (ani) is the Existence of the &quot;Ayn&quot; or Vast Face Nothing. 
  The whole of `Irfan is contained within the Understanding of this Reality of 
  &quot;i am not&quot; (ani ayn). This is why to every question before this his 
  reply was &quot;no&quot;. This is also why `Isa Al-Masih clearly stated that 
  Yahya WAS in fact Eliyahu making his Raja' min Ghaybah:</p>
<p>&quot;As these went their way, Yeshuah began to say to the multitudes concerning 
  Yochanan, 'What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by 
  the wind? But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those 
  who wear soft clothing are in king's houses. But why did you go out? To see 
  a Nevi (prophet)? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a Nevi. For this is he, 
  of whom it is written, <b>'Behold, I send my Messenger before your Face, who 
  will prepare your Way before you.'</b> Most assuredly I tell you, among those 
  who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than Yochanan the 
  immerser; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he. From 
  the days of Yochanan the immerser until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, 
  and the violent take it by force. For all the Nevi'im (Prophets) and the Torah 
  prophesied until Yochanan. If you are willing to receive it, this is Eliyahu, 
  who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&quot; - Matthew 11:7-15</p>
<p>`Isa Al-Masih was asked about the Raj'a of Nabi Ilyas, <b>as this was prophetically 
  a prerequisite for the coming of &quot;Mashiach.&quot;</b></p>
<p>They asked him, saying, &quot;Why do the scribes say that Eliyahu must come 
  first?&quot; He said to them, &quot;Eliyahu indeed comes first, and restores 
  all things. How is it written about the Son of Adam, that he should suffer many 
  things and be despised? But I tell you that Eliyahu has come, and they have 
  also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.&quot; 
  Mark 9:11-13</p>
<p>And an Angel of Allah proclaimed this to Zakariah: &quot;A Malak of YHWH appeared 
  to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. Z'kharyah was troubled 
  when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. But the Malak said to him, &quot;Don't 
  be afraid, Z'kharyah, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elisheva 
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(El-Sabat - Elizabeth)</font>, will 
  bear you a son, and you shall call his name Yochanan. You will have joy and 
  gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth. For he will be great in the sight 
  of YHWH, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with 
  the Ruach Ha'Qodesh, even from his mother's womb. He will turn many of the children 
  of Yisra'el to YHWH, their Eloah. He will go before him in the spirit and power 
  of Eliyahu, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the disobedient 
  to the wisdom of the Just; to make ready a people prepared for YHWH.&quot; Luke 
  1:11-17</p>

<p><b>IMAM AL-MADHI IN EASTERN TRADITIONS</b></p>
<p>Most world religions believe in some type of Apocalyptic leader-savior who 
  will come upon Earth during a time of great corruption and destruction. He will 
  usher in a new age of righteousness. Similarly most traditions hold that this 
  individual will come with a complementary helper. In the Judaic tradition it 
  is <b>Eliyahu and Mashiach</b>; in Christianity they are the <b>Two Witnesses 
  of the Book of Revelation</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Genesis 
  18 and 19; Matthew 17:1-6)</font>, Christians also anticipating the return of 
  Elijah as one of those Witnesses, as well as anticipating the return of &quot;Christ.&quot; 
  In Islam there is the expectation of <b>the Mahdi and Masih</b>. Though the 
  names vary slightly from language to language and culture to culture, the underlying 
  description and often even the names themselves are the same. </p>
<p>In the Hindu tradition the Mahdi or &quot;Elijah&quot; archetype is referred 
  to as<b> the Kalki Avatar</b>. In Buddhism he is called <b>Maitreya</b>, the 
  future Buddha who will renew Buddhist principles and guide others into a state 
  of Nirvana.</p>

</p>
<p>According to Hindu belief many believe that there have been as many as <b>28</b> 
  avatars, there are <b>ten main avatars</b> that are more commonly believed to 
  have come down to earth at various cyclical stages. Interestingly the Qur'an 
  mentions approximately the same number of main Prophets, yet Islamic tradition 
  maintains that there are 124,000 Prophets in all, sent to all nations and peoples. 
</p>
<p>&quot;And verily We have raised in every nation a Rasul (Messenger), (proclaiming): 
  Serve Allah and shun Taghut (all false deities). Of the people were some whom 
  Allah guided, and some on whom error became inevitably (established). So travel 
  through the earth, and see what was the end of those who denied (the Truth).&quot; 
  Al-Qur'an, Sura 16:36 </p>
<p>Such Messengers are referred to in Hinduism as having emerged in different 
  ages of the world, <b>and to have consisted of different proportions of the 
  essence of the Divine</b>. Their number is variously stated, ranging from ten 
  to twenty-eight, finally becoming indefinitely numerous. This is likened to 
  Islam's 28 primary Anbiyah or Prophets, and the seemingly incomprehensible 124,000 
  Anbiyah who arose throughout all nations and peoples. </p>
<p><b>WHEN WILL THE KALKI AVATAR COME?</b></p>
<p><b>For Hindus, Kalki is the Avatar of the impending age</b>. It is believed 
  that he will come to the earth at the end of an age of Destruction &quot;when 
  corruption is beyond every measure of control, necessitating the end of the 
  world.&quot; This end of this age of Destruction is commonly referred to as 
  the Kali Yuga, or dark age. According to the Bhagavad Gita, one of the Hindu 
  Holy Scriptures, an Avatar will come, &quot;Whenever there is decay of righteousness... 
  and there is exaltation of unrighteousness, then I, Myself come forth... for 
  the destruction of evil-doers for the sake of firmly establishing righteousness. 
  <b>I am born from age to age.&quot;</b> - Bhagavad Gita, fourth discourse </p>
<p>The word &quot;Kalki&quot; is actually an abbreviation of the word &quot;Niskalankh.&quot; 
  Niskalankh means the same as &quot;My name is,&quot; which means &quot;Nirmala,&quot; 
  or &quot;spotlessly clean.&quot; Something that is spotlessly clean is &quot;Niskalankh&quot; 
  - without any spot marks. Now this incarnation has been described in many Puranas 
  as will be coming on this Earth on a white horse in a village of Sambhalpur. 
  They call it Sambhalpur. However, the literal meaning of the word &quot;Sambhalpur&quot; 
  means &quot;bhal&quot; is the &quot;forehead.&quot; &quot;Sambhal&quot; means 
  &quot;at that state.&quot; Thus, Kalki is situated at your &quot;bhal.&quot; 
  Bhal is the forehead and here he is/was born. That is the real meaning of the 
  word &quot;Sambhalpur.&quot; <b>So far from describing a literal place where 
  the Imam Al-Mahdi, the Kalki Avatar must be born, this speaks of his awakening 
  &quot;birth&quot; of consciousness</b>. </p>
<p>The Vishnu Purana, another sacred Vedic text also reflects this belief: &quot;He 
  will then re-establish righteousness upon the Earth, and <b>the minds of those 
  who live at the end of the Kali age shall be awakened</b>, and shall be as pellucid 
  as crystal. The men who are thus changed by virtue of that peculiar time shall 
  be as the seeds of human beings, and shall give birth to a race who shall follow 
  the laws of the Krita age, the Age of Purity.&quot; - Vishnu Purana 4:24 </p>
<p>&quot;Kalki will be the one who is the beginning and the end, and who comprehends 
  all things... [he will] be endowed with eight superhuman faculties. By his irresistible 
  might he will destroy all the barbarians and thieves, and all those whose minds 
  are devoted to iniquity&quot; - Vishnu Purana 4:24 </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;When deceit, falsehood, lethargy, sleepiness, violence, despondency. 
    grief, delusion, fear, and poverty prevail, that is the Kali Yuga...&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>&quot;...mortal beings will become dull-witted, unlucky, voracious, destitute 
    of wealth yet voluptuous, and women, wanton and unchaste?. </p>
  <p>&quot;Petty-minded people will conduct business transactions and merchants 
    will be dishonest. In the Kali Yuga, men will abandon their parents, brothers, 
    friends, and relatives. They will occupy high seats and will preach religion. 
    People will have their minds weighed down with constant anxiety and fear. 
    This will be due to devastating famines and heavy taxation. The land will 
    not grow food-crops, and the people will always be in fear of impending droughts.&quot; 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the undeniable similarities between this &quot;Kalki Avatar&quot; and 
  the &quot;Imam al-Mahdi&quot; of Shi'a Islam. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Listen to the good news about the Mahdi! He will rise at the time when 
    people will be faced with severe conflict and the earth will be hit by a violent 
    quake. He will fill the earth with justice and equity as it is filled with 
    injustice and tyranny. He will fill the hearts of his followers with devotion 
    and will spread justice everywhere.&quot; Bihar al-Anwar, Vol. 51, p. 74 </p>
  <p>&quot;The world will not come to an end until a man from the descendants 
    of Husayn takes charge of the affairs of the world and fills it with justice 
    and equity as it is filled with injustice and tyranny.&quot; Bihar al-Anwar, 
    51, p. 73. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>WHO IS MAITREYA?</b></p>
<p>Another clear correlation with the Islamic traditions of the Imam al-Mahdi 
  is the Maitreya Buddha. Maitreya, in Buddhism, is a &quot;being of enlightenment&quot; 
  <b>who is said to reside in Tushita Heaven awaiting rebirth. Maitreya is a &quot;Bodhisattva,&quot; 
  a figure who denies himself entry into the Paradise of Nirvana</b>. Maitreya 
  did this out of compassion and his desire to help others. Overtime, Maitreya 
  has evolved into a figure that will free the world from suffering upon his rebirth. 
  Because Buddhism itself is so pervasive in several diverse regions of Asia, 
  Maitreya holds different meanings. Maitreya is as universal to Buddhists as 
  Gautama Siddharttha himself. What remains common is the fact that: &quot;In 
  every Buddhist culture Maitreya is a symbol of hope, of the human aspiration 
  for a better life in the future when the glories of the golden past will be 
  regained&quot; - &quot;Maitreya, the Future Buddha&quot;</p>
<p>Maitreya as described in The Mahaparinirvana Sutra Chapter V, Verses 1-14: 
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;And Ananda, holding back his tears, said to the Buddha: 'Who will teach 
    us when you are gone?' And the Blessed One answered: 'I am not the first Buddha 
    who has come upon the Earth, nor shall I be the last. In the right time, another 
    Buddha will arise in the world, a Holy One, a Supremely Enlightened One, endowed 
    with wisdom in conduct, auspicious, Knowing the Truth, an incomparable leader 
    of men, a Master of Spirit and mortals. He will reveal to you these Eternal 
    Truths. He will preach his Dharma, <b>Glorious in its Origin, Glorious in 
    the Middle, and Glorious in its end, in the Spirit as well as the letter</b>. 
    He will proclaim a life of Dharma, wholly Perfect and Pure, even as I now 
    proclaim.' Ananda said: 'How shall we know him?' And the Buddha said: 'He 
    will be known as Maitreya which means, <b>the friend</b>.'&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>BUDDHA IN THE QUR'AN</b></p>
<p>The initial rejection of this notion by the so-called orthodoxy, is that most 
  mainstream Muslimin do not hold Buddha as a Nabi, and thus render all narrations, 
  from him and all prophecies of the future from the Buddhist tradition as invalid. 
  However, just because one of the 124,000 Anbiyah might not happened to have 
  been mentioned in the Qur'an, this does not make them any less Prophets of Islam. 
  To ensure that no one would be misled by the relatively short list of Prophets 
  mentioned in the Qur'an, it was affirmed that: </p>
<p>&quot;And, indeed We have sent Rusul (Messengers) before you; of some of them 
  We have related to you their story; and of some We have not related to you their 
  story, and it was not given to any Rasul (Messenger) that he should bring a 
  sign except by the Leave of Allah. So, when comes the Commandment of Allah, 
  the matter will be decided with Truth, and the followers of falsehood will then 
  be lost.&quot; Qur'an, Sura 40:78 </p>
<p>&#147;And Rusul (Messengers) We have mentioned to you before, and Rusul (Messengers) 
  We have not mentioned to you - and to Musa (Moses) Allah spoke directly&#148; 
  Qur'an, Sura 4:164 </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Buddha IS a Nabi, and one mentioned in the Qur'an at that. </p>
<p>&quot;And Ismail, and Idris, <b>AND ZHU-L-KIF</b>. All were of the steadfast.&quot; 
  Qur'an, Sura 21:85 </p>
<p>Zhu-l-Kifl an-Nabi, meaning &quot;the one from Kifl,&quot; is mentioned by 
  name twice in the Qur'an; here as well as in Sura 38:48. This title, &quot;Zhu-l-Kifl&quot; 
  (rather than a name), refers to Shakyamuni Buddha. The name &quot;Kifl&quot; 
  is the `Arabic form of &quot;Kapila,&quot; an often used form of &quot;Kapila 
  Vastu.&quot; </p>
<p>The Yusuf `Ali Commentary on 21:85 says:</p>
<p>&quot;Dhul-Kifl literally means 'possessor of, <b>or giving, a double requital 
  or portion</b>.' It is said that probably Dhul-Kifl is <b>an Arabicized form 
  of Ezekiel.&quot; </b>The latter part of this tafsir is unacceptable. Ezekiel 
  is an anglicized version of the Hebrew &quot;Yechezqial&quot; which is &quot;Heziqiyal&quot;, 
  in `Arabic. </p>
<p>When i say that &quot;Zhu'l-Kifl&quot; means &quot;the One from Kifl&quot; 
  it is an attempt to translate the meaning, the approximation, into English. 
  The mid-twentieth century Urdu scholar Abu'l-Kalam Azad, in his Quranic commentary 
  Tafsir Sura Fatiha, was the first that i have seen to go on record that the 
  Prophet Zhu'l-Kifl, meant &quot;the one from Kifl,&quot; and that this figure, 
  mentioned twice in the Quran (21:85 and 38,48) as patient and good, referred 
  to Gautama Siddharttha (as). Although most scholars identify Zhu'l-Kifl with 
  the Prophet Ezekiel, Azad explained that &quot;Kifl&quot; is the Arabicized 
  form of Kapila, short for Kapila Vastu. </p>
<p>This is not hard to see, since there is no &quot;p&quot; in the `Arabic letters, 
  and words that would normally get a &quot;p&quot; like &quot;Palestine&quot; 
  or &quot;Persia&quot; are given an &quot;Fa.&quot; So with that in mind you 
  have the same core consonantal letters of &quot;KFL&quot; for the name of this 
  location. Compare this to the popular notion that &quot;Zhu'l-Kifl&quot; is 
  an `Arabicized form of &quot;Yechezqial.&quot; The core consonants are totally 
  different. There is no &quot;qaf&quot; there is an extra &quot;lam&quot; there 
  is a &quot;kaf&quot; instead of a &quot;qaf.&quot; There is absolutely no reason 
  to imagine that this is the `Arabic form of Ezekiel. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Unless 
  one understands the &quot;double portion&quot;)</font>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the first part that renders the name as meaning the &quot;possessor 
  of kifl&quot; is correct, since Gautama Siddharttha's father was in fact the 
  ruler of Kapila, and the profound thing about the Buddha was in fact that he 
  was offered anything his heart desired, but he rejected the illusions of the 
  Dunya <b>in pursuit of the enlightenment that he found beneath the Fig Tree</b>.</p>
<p>To be sure, there will be many who out rightly attack this position. They will 
  extol their familiarity with `Arabic as their native language. They will attack 
  myself for not being a product of `Arab or Persian culture. There is not a single 
  word of this text that is concerned with such individuals. As the Qur'an says: 
</p>
<p>&quot;As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether you warn 
  them or do not warn them; they will not believe.&quot; Al-Qur'an, Sura 2:6</p>
<p>Such individuals wish to hold some exclusivity on Islamic culture. To such 
  individuals `Arab culture is Islamic culture, and Islamic culture is `Arab culture. 
  The cannot separate the two in their minds, and accordingly their efforts at 
  &quot;dawah&quot; become nothing more than an attempt at imposing cultural assimilation 
  on those who come into the fold of Islam. </p>
<p>To such individuals non-Semitic anbiyah are a major threat. Even though the 
  Qur'an tells us clearly that such individuals were sent to ALL nations and peoples, 
  the status quo of the corrupt `ulama will try to explain away those who do not 
  fit their cultural interpretation. Nevertheless, Muhammad said clearly: &quot;There 
  was a prophet of Allah in India who was dark in color and his name was Kahan.&quot;</p>
<p>Notes: &quot;Taarikh-i-Hamdaan Dailami&quot; Baab-ul-Kaaf. See Pocket book 
  p: 854 by Malik Abdur Rehman Khadim 6th edition Published in 1952. </p>
<p>To the status quo that cannot even accept the myriad of ahadith about the Nubian 
  mother of the 12th Imam, such notions would definitely be unpopular to say the 
  least.</p>
<p><b>WHO WAS THE BUDDHA?</b></p>
<p>Gautama Buddha was the founder of Buddhism. His original name was Siddharth 
  (meaning one who has accomplished). He was also called Sakyamuni, i.e. the sage 
  of the tribe of Sakya. He was born in the year 563 B.C.E. in the village of 
  Lumbini near Kapila Vastu, within the present borders of Nepal. </p>
<p>Moreover, allusion is made <b>in the Ayaat of the fig tree</b> (Ayaat 95:1-5) 
  <b>to the fig as a source of Enlightenment</b>. Buddha is said to have attained 
  enlightenment <b>at the foot of this fig tree</b>. This is a subtle and batini 
  reference to be sure, but it is clear that the Qur'an is referring to the fig 
  as something on par - in terms of Wahy (Revelation) and Ilham - with Mount Sinin 
  (Sinai) which is mentioned in the second Ayah. </p>
<p>Of course this is known by Shaiyatin such as the so-called &quot;Mulla&quot; 
  Umar. This is why he was so zealous in destroying the Buddhist statues that 
  are permitted to remain as national artifacts under Shariah al-Islami. Buddha 
  never claimed to be Allah nor did he ask or instruct that he should be worshipped 
  in any way or form. According to the Dhammapada: &quot;The Jathagatas are only 
  Preachers.&quot; He came with the same Risalah that all Anbiyah came with, that 
  there is no god, no deity to be worshiped, there is only Allah. This is the 
  essence of Islam taught by the Buddha, the great Nabi al-Islam, Zhu-l-Kifl. 
</p>
<p>&quot;And they broke their religion (into sects) between them: to Us shall 
  all come back.&quot; Al-Qur'an, Sura 21:93 </p>
<p>Some might wonder then why there are all of these &quot;different&quot; religions. 
  Why is there &quot;Buddhism&quot; why &quot;Christianity?&quot; Yet did &quot;Christ&quot; 
  ever utter the word &quot;Christianity?&quot; Did Buddha ever call people to 
  bow before idols of him, or to seek after any state other than &quot;Nirvana&quot; 
  or &quot;Fana?&quot; No, this Ayah clarifies that it was mankind who broke off, 
  diverting in many directions from the original teachings of the Anbiyah. These 
  were not the teachings of the Anbiyah, but rather the sectarianism of man, and 
  the Fitnat'ud-Dajjal. </p>
<p><b>WHEN WILL MAITREYA COME</b></p>
<p>Of his own correlative return - as the second of the Two Witnesses - `Isa al-Masih 
  relayed the prophecy: &quot;And you shall hear of wars &amp; rumors of wars...For 
  nation shall rise against nation, &amp; kingdom against kingdom.&quot; Matthew 
  24:7 </p>
<p>According to Nicholas Roerich, author of Heart of Asia (c. 1927): </p>

<p>&quot;It is predicted that the manifestations of Maitreya shall come after 
  the wars. But the final war shall be for the cause of the True Teaching. <b>But 
  each one rising up against Shamballa shall be stricken in all his works</b>. 
  And the waves shall wash away his dwellings. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Daniel 
  9:26; Revelation 17:15). </font>And even a dog shall not answer to his call. 
  No clouds but lightening shall he see on the final night. And the fiery messenger 
  shall rise up on pillars of Light. The Teaching indicates that each warrior 
  of Shamballa shall be named the Invincible. The Lord Himself hastens. And his 
  banner is already above the mountains. <b>Your pasture shall reach the Promised 
  Land</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(and it is not in Palestine)</font>.When 
  you tend your flocks, do you not hear the voices of the stones? These are the 
  toilers of Maitreya, who make ready for you the treasures.&quot; Kalki Maitreya</p>
<p>Maitreya is claimed to have said, or it was said of his nature: &quot;Without 
  disturbing anyone, I will chose my moment. Even when you see me, do not run 
  after me. If you run after me, you will lose me. If you parade me, you do not 
  know who I am. I cannot be monopolized - I belong to everyone. I have not come 
  to create followers. Each of you should continue to develop within your own 
  religious tradition. Respect your own religions, your own ideologies - in brief, 
  your own thought form, and you will experience the Master. I do not want you 
  to believe in me. I want you to experience me. If you take one step towards 
  me, I will take two steps towards you. I will lend you my strength. I am always 
  with you.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(This, of course, 
  is the Higher Self--the Angelof Divine Presence--speaking to the collective 
  lower self)</font>.</p>
<p>&quot;<b>The approaching Maitreya is symbolized with His feet set upon earth</b>-the 
  symbol of haste. It is predicted that the manifestation of Maitreya shall come 
  after the wars. <b>But the final war shall be for the True Teaching</b>. <b>But 
  each one rising up against Shambhala shall be stricken in all his works</b>. 
  And the waves shall wash away his dwelling. And even a dog shall not answer 
  to his call. Not clouds but lightning shall he see on the final night. <b>And 
  the red messenger shall rise up on pillars of Light</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Isaiah 
  63:1-4; 66:15-18; 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10)</font>. The teaching indicates that 
  each warrior of Shambhala shall be named the Invincible. &quot; </p>
<p>The traditions surrounding Maitreya describe him taking on a variety of forms, 
  such as a slothful student, a companion of the Buddha, or a kind tutor. In China, 
  he is revered as a folk deity who wanders the country with a third eye in his 
  back. In addition, Chinese emperors and empresses have claimed to be the incarnation 
  of Maitreya in order to achieve political security. Sometime in the 4th or 5th 
  century, Buddhist monks brought the cult of Maitreya to Korea, where followers 
  established him as a god of fertility who grants infants to barren women and 
  answers the prayers of children. In Japan, celebrated teacher Kukai claimed 
  he was Maitreya when he founded the Shingon (Pure Word) sect of Buddhism in 
  the early 9th century. Maitreya remains one of the few bodhisattvas revered 
  in both Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism. </p>
<p>At the moment of Maitreya's birth, Buddhist law is said to have completely 
  degenerated, requiring a new revelation. The Islamic perspective is that Gautama 
  Siddharttha, the Qur'anic &quot;Dhu'l-Kifl&quot; did not teach any &quot;ism&quot; 
  or schism. He did not teach &quot;Buddhism&quot; but rather taught us the Natural 
  Religion, <b>the Religion of Nature, the &quot;Din al-Fitrah&quot; as Muhammad 
  called Islam</b>. In Truth he taught that there is No god only Allah, and that 
  Nirvana, or &quot;Fana&quot; in `Arabic, is attained through Submission, literally 
  &quot;Islam&quot; to Allah. </p>
<p><b>By some accounts, Maitreya will lead all beings still trapped in the cycle 
  of rebirths to nirvana</b>. Others maintain that he will preach for 60,000 years, 
  after which he will enter nirvana and his doctrine will endure for another 10,000 
  years. This is remarkably similar to the 50,000 year Zaman al-Masih or Era of 
  the Messiah in Islam. It is mentioned in the Qur'an as the day whose measure 
  is 50,000 years. This is clarified by the great `Arif Mulla Sadra who accurately 
  interpreted that this 50,000 year <b>&quot;Yawm&quot; is the Day of Resurrection, 
  or &quot;Yawm Al-Qiyyamah.&quot;</b></p>
<p align="center"><a href="../../UsedImages/pg06.gif"><img src="../../UsedImages/pg152.gif" width="480" height="169" border="0"></a></p>
<p>&quot;Al-Mala'ikah (The Angels) and Ar-Ruh (the Spirit/Primordial Messiah) 
  Ascend unto Hu (Allah) in a Day the measure whereof is 50,000 years.&quot; Al-Qur'an, 
  Sura 70:4 </p>
<p>In Sura 70:4 we are told that the Malaikah and the Ruh will Ascend to Hu over 
  the course of 50,000 Dunya years. This refers to the 50,000 year Zaman Al-Masih 
  that will transpire after the Rise of Al-Qa'im and the 309 Reign of Mahdi Al-Hussayn, 
  the successor to Imam Al-Mahdi. Mulla Sadra commented on these Quranic words 
  by explaining that &quot;those of old (al-awwalin)&quot; means &quot;your fathers 
  and those who came before you.&quot; &quot;Those of later time (al-akhirin)&quot; 
  stands for &quot;those who will come after your time.&quot; He interprets the 
  words &quot;an appointed day (miqat yawm ma'lum)&quot; as &quot;the time of 
  promise (ajal) that Allah appointed to his servants, and the Day of Resurrection 
  (yawm al-qiyamah).&quot; After a brief quotation from al-Zamakhshari's Qur'anic 
  commentary on a grammatical point, he interprets the Day as follows: </p>
<p><b>&quot;It is a day which encompasses all the created, for it includes all 
  days on account of its extent being fifty thousand years</b>. In a similar way, 
  the Earth of the place of resurrection (mahshar) has the capacity to receive 
  all of them, for it contains all the earth. This is confirmed by `Urafa (Mystics). 
  The ma'iyah (togetherness) with, and the jam'iyah (comprehensiveness) of the 
  created are of a kind different from that of temporal or spatial togetherness. 
  In what mode is it? The totality of separate times does not constitute another 
  time and the totality of separate spaces does not constitute another space. 
  The totality of al-dar (this world) has no world except in the sense that it 
  has another mode of being.&quot; </p>
<p><b>1999-2003: TRANSITION FROM THE KALI YUGA TO THE SAYA YUGA</b></p>
<p>The most startling correlation between these traditions however, is the dating. 
  While Shi'a Islam teaches that no one knows the exact date of the Imam's Rise 
  to political and military power, we DO believe that he has been with us for 
  some time. We believe that the Earth is in fact NEVER devoid of the Hujjat'ullah. 
  <b>Nonetheless, we are given the sign of the double eclipse of the Holy Month 
  of Ramadan as indication of the imminence of the Rise. That double eclipse occurred 
  both when the Imam was 28 years old, and it is also occurring for the last time 
  in hundreds and hundreds of years this very year of 2003</b>. More significantly, 
  it is occurring this last time in the exact same way that Imam al-Baqir foretold 
  that it would.</p>
<p align="center"><b>1975 - 2003 (28 YEARS)</b></p>
<p>Not coincidentally, the Kali Yuga officially ends transition into the Saya 
  Yuga -<b> thus closing the possible time frame for the Kalki Avatar to emerge 
  - in the summer of 2003</b>. These are signs for those who reflect. </p>
<p>There should be no doubt for the true Mu'min that the Maitreya, the Kalki Avatar 
  and the Imam al-Mahdi are ALL the exact same anticipated figure. The question 
  that you now face is what does this mean to you. Can these worldwide correlations 
  be mere coincidence? Can this be all just superstition and legends of the ancients? 
</p>
<p>&quot;And of them there are some who hearken to you, and We have laid veils 
  upon their hearts lest they understand it, and in their ears a heaviness; and 
  (even) if they see every sign they will not believe in it, so that when they 
  come to you they dispute with you, those who disbelieve say : ' This is nothing 
  but the legends of the ancients'.&quot; Al-Qur'an, Sura 6:25</p>
<p>While those who chose not to see what is laid plainly before them will scoff 
  and doubt, these correlations just further reaffirm the resolve of the true 
  partisans of the Imam al-Mahdi, those who await, educate and train themselves 
  and others in the unwavering FAITH that his Rise is IMMINENT. </p>
<p>Has Such a Sign Ever Happened Before?</p>
<p>Lunar and solar eclipses occur often during the same month. However, they do 
  NOT occur often during the month of Ramadan. Of those that do occur every couple 
  of hundred years or so, almost all are in fact &quot;partial&quot; eclipses 
  which are not considered &quot;true eclipses&quot; nor can such partial eclipses 
  be seen without telescopic enhancement. There is no question as to whether these 
  were considered eclipses in the past, since these were completely unobservable. 
  We know that the Shi'a Hadith on this matter clarifies that &quot;...in a certain 
  month of Ramadan there will be an eclipse of the moon on the first of the three 
  nights usual for such eclipses and in the same month in the second of three 
  days assigned for the solar eclipse there will occur an eclipse of the sun.&quot;</p>
<p>Accordingly we know that, while it is significant that the first of such signs 
  in the month of Ramadan since it's implementation as the month of the Islamic 
  fast occurred when the Imam was 28, the REAL significance is in the fact that 
  it is THIS Shahar Ramadan in which the alignment that Imam Al-Baqir foretold 
  will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>So our beloved Imam was ALREADY with us for 28 years when this double eclipse 
  happened. We also know that the one of 2003 will be the last FULL Double Eclipse 
  in the Month of Ramadan for many hundreds of years. Taken in conjunction with 
  all of the other signs of the times, and with the Eastern traditions that relay 
  the Kalki Avatar will emerge in the year 2003, there can be little doubt as 
  to the significance of this pair of Eclipses in 2003.</p>
<p>So we are not told that the Ramadan eclipse at the advent of his return has 
  NEVER happened - in fact we KNOW it happened for the first recorded time when 
  our Imam was 28 years old. We are told only that this will be the sign of his 
  return. It will not signify that his return is &quot;close&quot; but it will 
  signify that the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; of the Dajjal is close as Sura 
  al-Qiyamah alludes to. We know that this reference in Al-Qur'an cannot be the 
  double eclipse of the Imam's 28th year in 283 AH/896 CE, <b>because we are told 
  that in the &quot;Day of That&quot; people will ask &quot;where is the refuge,&#148; 
  or &quot;where can we fly to.&quot;</b> Accordingly, these Ayaat specify, &#147;In 
  the Day of That&#148; - not in a day hundreds of years later.</p>
<p>Guru Granth Sahib says in the scripture sacred to the Sikhs: &quot;When the 
  Nishkalank Avtar will appear, his coming will be proclaimed unto the whole world; 
  <b>and the sun and the moon will give his evidence.&quot;</b></p>
<p>We also know that the double eclipse of the Imam's return is the one referenced 
  in the following earlier Kutub Al-Anbiya...</p>
<p><b>&quot;The stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give 
  their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall 
  not cause her light to shine&quot;</b> - Isaiah 13:10</p>
<p>Similarly we read: <b>&quot;Immediately after the tribulation of those days 
  shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars 
  shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; and then 
  shall appear the sign of the Son of Adam in heaven.&quot;</b> - Matthew 24:29</p>
<p>Here it is confirmed that &quot;then shall appear the sign of the Son of Adam 
  in Heaven.&quot; This is a different sign than the aforementioned double Ramadan 
  eclipse that is noted earlier in that same verse. The final &quot;sign of the 
  Son of Adam in Heaven&quot; is a sign of the return of `Isa Al-Masih, as he 
  was referred to by himself and by other as the Son of Adam, including in the 
  book of Matthew which that prophecy was reported. </p>
<p>So we know that the double eclipse of the most significance was not the one 
  of 283 AH/896 CE, as that one was not also corresponding with the return of 
  `Isa Al-Masih, as the one in Az-Zaman Ad-Dajjal will be.</p>
<p>What Did the A&#146;immah Say About the Timing of the Eclipses In the Month, 
  As Opposed to Non-Shi'a Ahadith?</p>
<p>Dar&#146;ul-Qutni reports to have heard from Imam Muhammad Baqir the following 
  statement: <b>&#147;Our Mahdi shall be accompanied by two signs the like of 
  which have not happened since the creation of the heaven and the earth, namely, 
  that in a certain month of Ramadan there will be an eclipse of the moon on the 
  first of the three nights usual for such eclipses and in the same month in the 
  second of three days assigned for the solar eclipse there will occur an eclipse 
  of the sun.&#148;</b></p>
<p>This version clarifies &#147;the first of three nights usual for such eclipses.&#148; 
  This is a very big difference than the Sunni misinterpretation that says &#147;the 
  first of three nights&#148; - which implies that the eclipse would be during 
  the beginning of the month and thus invisible. Al-hamdulillah, the majority 
  of narrations on this matter are scientifically sound. The A&#146;immah told 
  us that we should use Reason above miracles. Muhammad also told us to seek out 
  `Ilm (science) even if we must go to China. We must never trade Reason and Science 
  for fantasy and myth....</p>
<p>The Lunar Eclipse has occurred on the 13th of Shahar Ramadan, &quot;the first 
  of the days usual for such eclipses&quot; as was said by Imam Al-Baqir. And 
  the Solar Eclipse is on the 23rd of November. <b>This is the 28th day of Shahar 
  Ramadan</b>, &quot;the second of three days assigned for the solar eclipse.&quot; 
  There can be no denying the matter. We are given the specific days of the eclipse 
  in the range of days in which they can feasibly occur. The Double Eclipse of 
  Shahar Ramdan 2003 has come to pass on the EXACT dates that Imam al-Baqir foretold. 
</p>
<p>Lisan al-Arabi is another famous Arabic lexicon. Under the term &#147;qamar&#148; 
  it says that is, the term &#147;qamar&#148; is used after the third night up 
  to the end of the month. Muhammad used the term &#147;qamar&#148; and not &#147;hilal.&#148; 
  Thus, it could not be the moon of the first night, as wrongly interpreted. To 
  believe that the solar system will somehow change is scientifically ridiculous. 
  If such a thing were to happen then this would throw the tides into disarray 
  as well as cause other acts contrary to nature. Also there is the question of 
  what would make the Earth and Moon change their course to accomplish such an 
  eclipse at the times contrary to nature? Certainly the Anbiya observed signs 
  of natural occurrences, they did not foretell of signs where Allah alters nature 
  just to make a point. <b>Rather it is the other way around, in the occurrences 
  of nature, and the movements of heavenly bodies are signs for those who reflect</b>. 
  <b>When the Anbiya observed these they realized the meanings of the signs. This 
  does not mean that said signs are a result of Divine alteration to the natural 
  order of the Universe, but rather that the Divine illuminated those with eyes 
  to see to have a glimpse of what these astrological signs mean</b>.</p>
<p><b>BUT AREN'T WE TOLD THAT NO ONE KNOW THE TIME?</b></p>
<p>Muhammad ibn Yahya has narrated from Salma ibn al-Khattab from Ali ibn Hassa&#146;n 
  from &#145;Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Kathir who has said the following:</p>
<p>&quot;Once I was in the presence of Abu &#145;Abd'ullah that Mihzam came in 
  and said to the Imam, &#145;May Allah take my soul in service for your cause, 
  enlighten me about this matter that we wait for. When it will take place?&quot; 
  The Imam said, &quot;O Mihzam, those who give it definite time have lied, the 
  expediting ones perish and salvation is for those who are submissive.&quot;</p>
<p>Notes: H 917, Ch. 82, h 2</p>
<p>&#147;I asked Abu &#145;Abd'ullah, about al-Qa&#146;im. He said, &#145;Those 
  who give it a definite time have spoken lies. We, Ahl al-Bayt, do not set a 
  definite time.&#146;&#148;</p>
<p>Notes: Al-Kafi, H 918, Ch. 82, h 3</p>
<p>Al-Husayn ibn Muhammad has narrated from Ja'far ibn Muhammad from al-Qasim 
  ibn &#146;Isma&#145;il al-Anbari from al-Hassan ibn Ali from Ibrahim ibn Mihzam 
  from his father who has said the following.</p>
<p>&#147;We mention before Abu &#145;Abd'ullah the kings from the descendants 
  of so and so. The Imam said, &quot;People have perished due to their haste for 
  this matter. Allah does not expedite it because of the haste of people. For 
  this matter, there is a goal towards which it proceeds. <b>Once they will reach 
  that goal they then will not be able to move it forwards or backwards, even 
  by one hour.&#148;</b></p>
<p>Notes: Al-Kafi, H 922, Ch. 82, h 7 </p>
<p>Certainly only Allah knows the specific date and time of Mahdi&#146;s Rise 
  but we do know that as the signs are revealed his return will be confirmed, 
  exponentially increasing confirmation will be given as to the immanence of his 
  return from occultation. For instance, once he is actually here - whether he 
  says &quot;i am the Mahdi and i am here&quot; or not - then certainly only Allah 
  KNEW the time of his return, but OBVIOUSLY at some point that knowledge will 
  be revealed, not only to the Ummah at large, but first to his Inner Circle of 
  12 (11 and his Wazir), and then to the 313 Taliyah Al-Mahdi.</p>
<p>There is no Hadith that says we will NEVER know when he will return. For the 
  sign could be a sign that his return IS ALREADY HAPPENING. He might already 
  be among us, just as the first double eclipse happened when the Imam was already 
  alive for a number of years. Significantly all astrological reports confirm 
  that this is the last double eclipse during the month of Ramadan to occur in 
  the foreseeable future. In 2,155 one will come close but it will not actually 
  be a full eclipse and will not be visible to the naked eye - and thus is not 
  a true eclipse, nor was it considered one at all in the time of Muhammad and 
  the A'immah.</p>
<p>Would it not reason that if this is the sign of the Rise of the Imam then the 
  last one for at least many hundreds of years - when all of the other signs have 
  been revealed - will be of a great significance? Essentially it comes down to 
  accepting that this will be the double eclipse in the month of Ramadan that 
  signifies his return from occultation, or not accepting such a sign at all. 
  Since all of the other signs have been fulfilled that are required before his 
  Rise, then there no reason but lack of Iman to doubt this clear proof of his 
  presence among us.</p>

  <p><i>The wise shall understand...</i><b>(Daniel 12:10)</b>.</p>
  <p><i>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him, He will shew them His

  <p><i>When the spirit of Truth shall come...</i><b>(John 16:1-21)</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly one can be skeptical and doubt the matter just as the majority of 
  the Ummah doubted the matter in 283 AH/896 CE. Allah has already told us in 
  advance that most will not accept this sign and both Sunni and Shi'a masses 
  will at first reject the Imam when he returns.</p>
<p>The sign of the double Ramadan eclipse does not mean our Imam will Rise on 
  that specific date. In fact there are two dates in that month, so it would be 
  impossible for it to be a calculation of THE date of his return. Rather it is 
  a sign that his return is upon us, meaning that he may by that time already 
  be returned but just not Risen to power.</p>
<p>We should not necessarily expect our Imam to Rise to power by that time, but 
  it would be nothing short of lack of Iman to doubt that he will have returned 
  in the context of planning his Rise with his 313 Mujahidin by that time. When 
  Allah and the Anbiya and the A'immah tell us that this is what that sign means 
  then who are we to second-guess them? Certainly <b>his military Rise</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(not 
  in the literal, or carnal sense)</font> will take some time and coordination 
  after that. But the Shi'a should know that his presence among us in a direct 
  leadership capacity is assured by this sign, to all who recognize him at his 
  appearance.</p>
<p>We cannot foresee the day Imam Mahdi will rise, but if Allah gives us a sign 
  as monumental as this one, we can be sure that it is meant for us, not for people 
  many years later. <b>When a sign that we are told holds the weight of 10 Signs 
  occurs, we would be foolish to imagine that this is a sign for any generation 
  but this one.</b> This does NOT mean that we know the time of his Rise, but 
  it does mean we know that this is the Age of his Rise. However, a person should 
  not say that this sign does not mean much in and of itself since <b>we are told 
  in fact that it means as much as 10 signs.</b> So even if one is of the presumption 
  that there are 10 more signs to be fulfilled then we are told that this sign 
  alone is worth as much as them all put together. These are signs for those of 
  Iman.</p>

<p><b>WHAT SHOULD WE DO?</b></p>
<p>Sahl ibn al-Hasan al-Khurasani who was one of the followers of ahlul-bayt in 
  khurasan (a province in Iran) came to Medina to meet imam Ja'far As-Sadiq. Sahl 
  al-Hhurasani said: &#147;O son of the Rasul Allah! You are of the A&#146;immah 
  of Ahl&#146;ul-Bayt. What prevents you from getting your right (i.e. the rule) 
  while you find more than one hundred thousand Shi'a who are ready to fight for 
  you?&#148; The Imam asked him to sit down, and then ordered to turn on the oven 
  that was in the house. after the oven became very hot and turned red, the Imam 
  said: &#147;O Khurasani step into the oven and sit in it.&#148; The Khurasani 
  said: &#147;My master, o son of the Rasul Allah! Do not punish me by fire and 
  make it easy for me.&#148; At this time, Harun al-Makki entered the room, and 
  after the greetings exchanged, the Imam told him to put down his shoes and to 
  sit down inside the oven. He did so and the Imam started talking to Sahl about 
  Khurasan as if nothing has happened. After some time, the Imam said: &#147;O 
  Khurasani stand up and look inside the oven.&#148; Sahl looked into the oven 
  and saw Harun sitting cross-legged inside the fire. Then Imam As-Sadiq asked 
  Harun to come out of oven and he came out healthy with no burn or injury. At 
  this time, the Imam asked Sahl: &#147;How many individuals do you know in Khurasan 
  like this man?&#148; Sahl replied: &#147;By Allah, not even one.&#148; The Imam 
  confirmed his saying and said, &#147;We do not rise at this time when we do 
  not even have five helpers (like him). <b>We know better about the proper time.&#148;</b></p>
<p>Notes: al-bihar, v47, p123, hadith #172; also in manaqib by ibn shahr ashub 
</p>
<p>In preparation for the advent of the return of Al-Qaim we should ask ourselves 
  some very serious questions. Firstly, are we personally ready for his return, 
  or are we secretly longing for his return at sometime in the hypothetical future, 
  so the burden of being among his Taliyah is not set upon us? Are we ready for 
  the hard life that he will call us to?...</p>

  sit back and passively accept oppression and tyranny as &#147;the way things 
  are.&#148; For the true Muslim, complicity is no longer an option.</p>
<p>We must look at our diets and strive to eat healthy and eliminate the poison 
  food and cigarettes that the system of Dajjal has force fed the world. We must 
  take exercise very seriously and if we are not already, begin a serious strength 
  and endurance enhancement program. We should all be training in Martial Arts. 
  We all should familiarize ourselves with modern weapons and weapon-craft, as 
  well as combat tactics on par with or superior to those of our enemies. Every
