  SPIRITS IN MAN</font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">All that ever was and 
      is comes from God. Before things came into existence He determined the plan 
      of them; and they fill their appointed roles. It is in accordance with His 
      glorious design that they discharge their functions. Nothing can be changed. 
      In His hands lies the government of all things. God is that which sustains 
      them in their needs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> Now this God created 
      man to rule the world, and appointed for him Two spirits after whose direction 
      he was to walk until the final inquisition. They are the spirits of Truth 
      and Perversity. The origin of Truth lies in the Fountain of Light </font><font size="+1">(the 
      Spiritual state of mind)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">, 
      and that of Perversity in the Wellspring of Darkness </font><font size="+1">(the 
      Natural impulse)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">. 
      All who practise righteousness are under the dominion of the Prince of Lights, 
      and walk in the ways of Light; whereas all who practice perversity are under 
      the dominion of the Prince of Darkness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Through the angel of 
      Darkness, however, even those who practice righteousness are made liable 
      to error. All their sins and their iniquities, all their guilt and their 
      deeds of transgression are the result of his dominion; And this, by God's 
      inscrutable design, will continue until the time appointed by Him. Moreover, 
      all of men's affliction and their moments of tribulation are due to this 
      being's malevolent sway. All the spirits that attend upon him are bent on 
      causing the children of Light to stumble. Howbeit, the God of Israel and 
      the Angel of His Truth are always there to help them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">It is God who created 
      these spirits of Light and Darkness, </font><font size="+1">(see Genesis 
      1:16)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">, and made 
      them the basis of every act, the instigators of every deed, and the directors 
      of every thought… This is why these spirits operate in the world. The enlightenment 
      of man's heart, the making straight before him all the ways of righteousness 
      and truth, the implanting in his heart of fear for the judgment of God, 
      of a spirit of humility, of patience, of abundant compassion, of perpetual 
      goodness, of insight, of perception, of that sense of the Divine Power that 
      is based at once on an apprehension of God's works, and a reliance on His 
      plenteous mercy, of a spirit of knowledge informing every plan of action, 
      of a zeal for righteous government, of a hallowed mind in a controlled nature, 
      of an abounding love for all who follow the truth, of a self-respecting 
      purity which abhors the taint of filth </font><font size="+1">(in one's 
      self)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">, these 
      are the things in the world that come to those in the world who walk in 
      communion with the spirit of Truth. And the guerdon of all who walk in its 
      ways is health and abundant well-being, </font><font size="+1">(abundant 
      life, not abundant wealth)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">, 
      with long-life and fruition of seed along with eternal blessings and everlasting 
      joy in the life everlasting, and a Crown of Glory and a Robe of Honour, 
      amid Light perpetual. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
      Manual of Discipline, The Dead Sea Scriptures.</font></p>
