  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be a mistake to suppose 
    that he writers of the Scrolls and the men of Qumran were inspired only by 
    recollections of things past or that they chose their way of life simply because 
    they were unsettled by political turbulence or disgusted by the venality of 
    the Jerusalemitan priests. They were swept by other winds. One of these was 
    a widespread and well-attested contemporary belief that the GREAT CYCLE OF 
    THE AGES WAS ABOUT TO COMPLETE ITS REVOLUTION. This belief was based on a 
    conception which can in fact be traced to remote Indian antiquity, that existence 
    consists not in linear progressive development--that is, in 'history'--but 
    in constant cyclic repetition of primordial and archetypal events. When major 
    upheavals occurred, it was promptly supposed that the cycle was nearing its 
    end, THAT THE GREAT YEAR WAS AT HAND, and that cosmos was about to revert 
    to chaos. The primordial elements, restrained and regulated at the beginning 
    of the world, would again be unleashed; all things would dissolve in an overwhelming 
    deluge or be burned in that everlasting fire </font>(of warfare) <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">which

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mention of the Essenes hopes of 
    a New Age of glory leads us naturally to some comments on the special theological 
    views of the Essenes that informed their understanding of history and gave 
    to their community its peculiar institutions. The Essenes belong in the center 
    of that movement (known as) apocalypticism. The late visionaries of the Old 
    Testament, notably the author of Daniel, as well as later Baptist and Christian 
    communities, discovered themselves to be living in the last days of the old 
    age, or rather in the days when the old age was passing away and the Kingdom 
    of God was dawning. According to apocalypticism the upsurge of evil powers 
    in the world reflected the last defiant outbreak of cosmic Satanic powers. 
    The gifts of the Holy Spirit manifest in the community of the faithful, adumbrated 
    the age of the Spirit to follow the final war in which the Spirit of Truth 
    and his heavenly armies would put an end to the rule of the powers of Darkness. 
    The constitution of the Essene community was a crystallized apocalyptic vision. 
    Each institution and practice of the community was a Preparation for or, by 
    anticipation, a realization of, life in the New Age of God's rule. On the 
    one hand, their communal life WAS A REENACTMENT OF THE EVENTS OF THE LAST 
    TIMES, both the final days of the Old Age AND THE ERA OF ARMAGEDDON.</font>(An 
    understanding that is reflected everywhere in the Gospel narratives)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand , their community, 
    being heirs of the kingdom, participated already in the gifts and glories 
    that were the firstfruits of the Age to come. For the apocalypticists of Qumran 
    the key to these future mysteries was AT HAND..</font></p>

  <p align="center"> SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS FEATURES FAMOUS TEACHER, HUGE CROWDS</p>
  <p align="center">By Shalynn Ford Harvey<br>
    Religion News Service </p>
  <p>PLAINS, Ga. &#151; A little more than 100 miles &#151; and several light-years 
    &#151; southwest of Atlanta lies a hamlet surrounded by pine trees, pecan 
    groves and peanut farms. A short row of turn-of-the-century buildings, including 
    an antiques store, trading post and modern post office, form the downtown. 
    Across the silent railroad tracks and a little ways down the road, at the 
    other end of town, is a small Baptist church where a faith-driven man is about 
    to begin teaching his weekly Sunday school lesson. </p>
  <p>As soon as a battery of somber but stylishly dressed Secret Service agents 
    signal the room is secure, the class commences. Welcome to Plains, Ga., idyllic 
    home of THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER&#151; FORMER PRESIDENT 
    JIMMY CARTER. </p>
  <p>&quot;We had 12,739 visitors last year,&quot; says the Rev. Daniel Ariail, 
    pastor of the 131-member Maranatha Baptist Church. The volume of visitors 
    could be daunting for some, but not to Ariail, who simply says of the crowds, 
    &quot;Blessed are the flexible, for they never get bent out of shape.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>He should know. He literally wrote the book &#151; a 197-page doctoral dissertation 
    &#151; on how to maintain hospitality and normality under arguably bizarre 
    circumstances, including armed guards and huge crowds regularly attending 
    Sunday worship service. &quot;We're a small church with a worldwide outreach,&quot; 
    Ariail said. He is, of course, referring to the global draw of his most famous 
    yet eminently accessible congregant, 79-year-old Jimmy Carter. Despite a grueling 
    travel and work schedule, he somehow manages to teach Sundays at the tiny 
    country church 35 to 40 weeks out of the year. </p>
  <p>A few minutes before 10 a.m., Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, arrive without 
    fanfare and enter the packed sanctuary via a noisy and frigid waiting room 
    jammed with an overflow of guests seated on metal folding chairs. They will 
    have to settle for hearing the former president deliver his lesson via closed-circuit 
    television. Only those who arrive at daybreak have a prayer of being seated 
    in the sanctuary. Aware of this inconvenience, Carter lingers behind in the 
    waiting room for almost 10 minutes, chatting with the audience and answering 
    a few questions. </p>
  <p>On this day, Carter sports a bolo tie with turquoise accents, dark-blue wool 
    jacket and slacks, and burgundy loafers. Although the air conditioner has 
    been cranked to Siberian summer so no one nods off during the videotaped service, 
    the aura of the room grows noticeably warmer with the presence of Carter &#151; 
    a peanut-farmer-turned-president-turned-peacemaker. </p>
  <p>Perhaps it is his altruism-in-action for the poor and disenfranchised. Or 
    his revered elder statesman title. But whatever &quot;it&quot; is, it keeps 
    people from California to Calcutta and places in between coming in droves 
    to see how a man who once led the free world now leads a small Sunday school 
    class at Maranatha Baptist Church. The church's name means &quot;Come, Lord.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>Carter begins this Sunday's lesson, titled &quot;The Lord's Supper,&quot; 
    with a humorous anecdote about viewing Mel Gibson's movie &quot;The Passion 
    of the Christ&quot; at a local theater. &quot;Rosalynn and I went (on a) Tuesday, 
    thinking there wouldn't be a big crowd since it was a weekday ... but the 
    Secret Service had to use their influence just to get us two seats together,&quot; 
    he said. The crowd laughs at the hominess of it all. Then Carter gets serious, 
    and the lesson officially begins. </p>
  <p>Gibson did an outstanding job, in Carter's opinion, of accurately depicting 
    Scripture. But, he adds, &quot;the violence was excessive&quot; and he was 
    &quot;disappointed with the last scene&quot; because he thought the Resurrection 
    was not given its full due, nor was it explained sufficiently enough for non-Christians 
    to understand. </p>
  <p>The lesson continues with a mix of Scripture, an interpretive narrative about 
    the symbolism and significance of the Lord's Supper, and personal anecdotes. 
    One included Carter's confession that, although a born-and-bred Baptist, he 
    routinely attended early morning Catholic services during his Navy days. He 
    said it freed up the rest of the day to spend with his family. </p>
  <p>All too soon, the lesson concludes and the teacher quietly departs the podium 
    to take his place next to his wife, and along with the rest of the congregation, 
    prepares to worship. Later, offertory plates &#151; handcrafted from Philippine 
    mahogany by Carter, who is also an accomplished carpenter, and hand-lined 
    with green felt by Rosalynn &#151; are passed around the room. </p>
  <p>A little more than an hour later, the service concludes with the choir singing 
    &quot;Christ Receiveth Sinful Men&quot; while the Carters quietly exit the 
    sanctuary. Once outside, they begin the tedious process of becoming photo 
    opportunities for the nearly 500 people who have trekked to Plains and endured 
    security checks to have their 15 seconds with a most extraordinary &quot;ordinary&quot; 
    man. </p>

  OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Ben Zion Wacholder</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Dead Sea Scrolls frequently 
    refer to a mysterious figure called the Teacher of Righteousness... According 
    to the most widely held view, the Teacher of Righteousness founded the Dead 
    Sea sect (the sect is usually identified with the Essenes). In this common 
    view, The Teacher of Righteousness organized the Community and composed many 
    of its important works.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nemesis of the Teacher of Righteousness 
    is another shadowy figure called the Wicked Priest. He is also known by a 
    number of other epithets, includung the Lion of Wrath </font>(see 1 Peter 
    5:8)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, the Liar, the Spreader of 
    Lies and the Man of Scoffing. Still following the standard interpretation, 
    the Wicked Priest and the Teacher of Righteousness are thought to be historical 
    figures. But that is where the consensus ends. There is no agreement over 
    who they were...</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>God raised for them a Teacher of Righteousness to guide them in the way 
      of his heart...This is the time concerning which it has been written: &quot;As 
      a backsliding heifer so did Israel slide back&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Hosea 
      4:16...Please see Chapter 10)</font>, when there arose the Man of Scoffing 
      who dropped on Israel waters of deceitfulness and caused them to wander 
      in the wilderness WHERE THERE IS NO PATH, to bring down the everlasting 
      heights, to turn away from the ways of righteousness and to remove the boundary 
      that the forefathers <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the early 
      Church)</font> have set for their inheritance. Damascus Document 1:10-17.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The various views come from what 
    might be called the (Dead Sea) Scroll establishment. More radical ideas are 
    espoused by Robert Eisenman and Barbara Thiering, each of whom, in different 
    ways, connects these figures with the founders of nascent Christianity. Eisenman 
    believes the Teacher of Righteousness was James, the brother of Jesus </font>(not 
    completely correct, but without doubt a teacher of righteousness in his own 
    right)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, and Paul was the liar </font>(an 
    extremely unlearned opinion...2 Peter 3:10-16 KJV)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    (a figure that Eisenman distinguishes from the Wicked Priest); Thiering puts 
    forth John the Baptist as the Teacher </font>(Open up the pages of the Revelation 
    of John--the Baptist)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> and Jesus 
    as the Wicked Priest </font>(imaginitive but absurd)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...I believe they are wrong. I

      deliver it up to be destroyed. And in the age of wrath He had given them 
      into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He visited them, and he 
      caused a plant root to spring from Israel and Aaron to inherit His land 
      and to prosper on the good things of His earth. And they perceived their 
      iniquity and recognized that they were guilty men, yet for 20 years they 
      were like blind men groping for the way.</p>

      of His heart.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Damascus Document</font>. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The Damascus Document is clearly 
    a messianic document. No one doubts that. Yet if the verbs in the above passage 
    are understood to be in the past tense, the passage would have had no relevance 
    to the author's purpose. It would have been merely a lesson in history, not 
    part of a messianic document.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In my view, when the Damascus Document 
    states that &quot;remembering the Covenant&quot; God &quot;visited them,&quot; 
    it echoes the passage in Genesis that announces the previously barren Sarah 
    had conceived: &quot;And the Lord visited Sarah&quot; (Genesis 21:1). </font>(Please 
    see the chapter on The Holy Child)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The Damascus Document is telling us that just as the biblical passage announced 
    a new beginning in the history of Israel, so too will there be a new beginning 
    to Israel's destiny in the author's own time. The messianic age was expected 
    momentarily.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is well known that the Dead 
    Sea Scroll sectarians </font>(the early Christians)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    interpreted Scripture as applying to their own time. That is how the </font>(390-years 
    after Nebuchadnezzar, plus 20 more)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    passage in the Damascus Document should be interpreted. </font>(Our author 
    now is also caught between two ends of the same story--Then and NOW--but he 
    is on the right track)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. This is 
    consistent with the interpretations in the so-called <i>pesharim </i>(pesher-singular), 
    or biblical commentaries on the books of the prophets and the psalms found 
    at Qumran. The <i>pesharim </i>quote a passage from Scripture and then give 
    an interpretation. The Qumran <i>pesharim</i> frequently refer to the Teacher 
    of Righteousness and the Wicked Priest in a messianic context,. For example, 
    Habakkuk 2:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Then God told Habakkuk to write down what is going to happen to the generation 
      to come; but when that period would be complete He did not make known to 
      him. When it says, &quot;so that with ease someone can read it,&quot; this 
      refers to the Teacher of Righteousness to whom God made known all the mysterious 
      revelations of his servants the prophets. Pesher Habakkuk. </p>
    <p><font size="+1">(Thus Paul, realizing what was written is what shall shall 
      come to pass in the last days, says):</font><i><font size="+1"> Beware therefore, 
      lest that come upon you (us), which is spoken in the prophets;</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="+1">Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish: for I work 
      a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a 
      man declare it unto thee...</font></i><font size="+1">(Acts 13:40,41; Habakkuk, 
      chapter 1).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...Here again we feel the futuristic 
    context. In several passages in the Damascus Document, the Teacher of Righteousness 
    is called not </font><i>Moreh ha-zedek</i> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">but 
    </font><i>Yorah ha-Zedek</i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, the 
    future form, which might be translated as &quot;he who will teach righteousness.&quot; 
    In one instance the text speaks of &quot;one who will teach righteousness 
    at the end of days, as if to emphasize the eschatological, futuristic context. 
    The modern-day editors of this text account for their use of the future form 
    by positing the expected return of the teacher of Righteousness. In fact, 
    all references to the Teacher of Righteousness point to the End of Days.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The question): Are they historical 
    or eschatological? The arguments get complicated and technical, as well as 
    philosophical. In each instance, however, I believe a strong case can be made 
    that the context is eschatological and futuristic. The authors of these works 
    understood them as pre-saging what they believed to be imminent--the coming 
    struggle between the Teacher of Righteousness and his nemesis, the Wicked 
    Priest, a struggle that would initiate the messianic age. </font>Bible Review, 
    April 1999<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Our view is that the <i>Teacher of Righteousness</i> exists 
  in all generations, and that the Scrolls have more than one eschatological figure 
  in mind. Such a teacher appeared among the emerging (and various) Essene communities 
  390 years after the Scythian conquests (the captivity in Babylon), and can almost 
  assuredly be identified with the author(s) of the Books of Daniel and Malachi, 
  and such other intertestamental books as The Book of Jubilees and the Books 
  of Enoch. And then, as the messianic age was about to dawn upon the earth, the 
  Druid priest John the Baptist (the original Yohanan ben Zakkai) appeared among 
  the Essenes, and pointed those who surrounded him back up into the center of 
  Israel's own mysteries. John acquired the title of the Teacher of Righteousness, 
  fulfilling all the prophecies that pointed to his coming, and is responsible 
  for the original teachings--the visions--that have been attributed almost singularly 
  to John the Apostle in the Book of Revelations. (The latter John simply adapted 
  John's revelations to those that came more clearly into view after the Apostle 
  Paul entered into the story. The final version of the Book of Revelations reflects 
  the reconciliation between John's baptism and Paul's [Acts 18:23-28; 19:1-7], 
  between John's visions of the Angel of Presence [Exodus 23:20-23; 24:9,10] and 
  Paul's visions of the Metatron Crucified [1 Corinthians 2:1-8]). After the followers 
  of John the Baptist returned to the Upper Jerusalem, </font><font size="+1">and 
  while Paul was still spreading his Doctrine of Christ across the known world, 
  it was James, the leader of the Essene community (at Vindebona), who received 
  the mantle of the Teacher of Righteousness. And now, having come to the Western 
  ends of the earth, and to the fulness of these times, the entire theological 
  and eschatological puzzle unfolds. Everyone is here and the stage is set:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bearing in mind the 
    difficulties faced in interpreting the material, we can make some suggestions 
    about the role of the Teacher of Righteousness as a mediator figure. </font></p>
</div>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Damascus Document:<br>
  The title appears at 1:11 &amp; 20:32 and in a slightly different form at 6:11. 
  The title &quot;Unique Teacher&quot;/&quot;Teacher of the Community&quot; is 
  also understood to refer to the Teacher of Righteousness. From 1:11 &amp; Col.20 
  the Teacher is seen possibly as the founder of the community. The laws and covenant 
  he established are the community's means of vindication and remain effective 
  after the Teacher's death. Col.6 anticipates a figure &quot;who will teach righteousness&quot; 
  in the end time. Is this figure in some way the re-appearance of the historical 
  Teacher? Or is he an ideal or messianic figure, perhaps modelled on historical 
  remembrances? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pesharim:<br>
  From the Pesharim a picture of the Teacher of Righteousness emerges: He is a 
  priestly leader of a community; in this role he is seen to suffer, perhaps to 
  face death. His interpretation of scripture is definitive for his community 
  and may perhaps be understood as his legacy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Written Legacy?<br>
  Various texts have been attributed to the hand of the Teacher - the Temple Scroll, 
  4QMMT, and various passages in the Hodayoth. None of these mention the Teacher 
  by name but texts such as 1QH 10 (=2):13 &amp; 32 seem to reflect incidents 
  recorded in the commentary on Habakkuk (1QHab5:8-11 or 11:1-8). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Identifying the Teacher of Righteousness?<br>
  The Teacher is generally identified as what his community considers to be the 
  legitimate high priest. As a priestly figure the Teacher's role as a mediator 
  would be the maintenance of the comunity's relationship with God, as his chosen 
  people. It is possible that the title 'Teacher of Righteousness' refers not 
  to one historical individual but to an office that is to be filled in the historical 
  realm. Possibly the office itself is an expected ideal. Alternatively in CD 
  6 it is the historical Teacher who is awaited-in the consummation pattern, although 
  whether the material allows for such an understanding is questionable. Possible 
  background for this view may have been suggested by Abegg's equation of the 
  author of 4Q427 with the Teacher: &quot;...as for me [my] office is among the 
  gods...&quot; If the Teacher is so exalted it might be reasonable to view his 
  activity as extending beyond his earthly existance, and incorporating his return 
  to the historical realm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus and the Teacher of Righteousness:<br>
  There are a number of similarities between the earthly roles of Jesus and the 
  Teacher, interpretation of scripture, the establishment of a law which is the 
  means of salvation; both suffer. After death the followers of both require further 
  guidence. There are also differences, the Teacher does not appear to be worshipped, 
  his community does not continue and expand after his death. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is possible that the Teacher of 
  Righteousness could be understood as a stage in the development of thought that 
  led to the worship of an individual. The Teacher reveals the prophetic mysteries 
  - of which Jesus is seen to be the fulfilment. Moreover in 1QHab8:1-3 faith 
  in the Teacher himself, along with obedience, is a necessary means of salvation. 
  In the NT Jesus is that means of Salvation. </font></p>

  The Damascus Covenant was found near the turn of the century in the Cairo Genizah 
  collection at Cambridge University. Scroll fragments, discovered in Qumran Cave 
  4 in the early 1950's by Solomon Schechter and called by him Fragments of a 
  Zadokite Work, had a number of affinities with the Damascus Covenant. &quot;Within 
  a hierarchical framework of priests, judges, and communal officers, the Damascene 
  Covenanters gave special prominence to the descendants of the high priest Zadok 
  (tenth [?] century B.C.). Because medieval writers had described an ancient 
  sect of 'Zadokites' whose beliefs were in a few instances identical with those 
  of the Covenanters, Schechter inferred that the Genizah text was a last surviving 
  remnant of the writings of this sect.&quot;<br>

  text indicate there was additional material at the beginning of the Zadokite 
  Fragments [Damascus Document], they preserve very little significant material 
  from that section, which must at one time have been part of a much longer passage. 
  The text of the Zadokite Fragments as preserved in medieval manuscripts begins 
  by declaring that in ancient times, Israel went astray. As a result, God 'hid 
  His face' and allowed the destruction of the First Temple (dated in modern scholarly 
  chronology to 586 B.C.E.). Yet a remnant of the defeated people remained, and

  &quot;The Damascus Document speaks firstly of a remnant of Jews who, unlike 
  their co-religionists, remained true to the Law. A 'Teacher of Righteousness' 
  appeared among them. Like Moses, he took them into the wilderness, to a place 
  called 'Damascus' </font>(The higher Syria, after whom the lower Syria and the 
  lower Damascus is named...Genesis 15:1,2)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And in the period of wrath, 
  three hundred ninety years after He had handed it (the Temple) over to Nebuchadnezzar 
  king of Babylonia, He remembered them (Israel) and caused to grow from Israel 
  and Aaron the root of a plant (i.e., the sect). Then they understood their transgression 
  and knew that they were guilty. They were like blind (men) groping on the road 
  for twenty years. Then God paid attention to their deeds for they sought Him 
  whole-heartedly, and He set up for them a Teacher of Righteousness to direct 
  them in the way of his (the teacher's) heart.&quot; - Zadokite Fragments 1:5-11

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scholars date the beginnings of the

  Righteousness. There were no significant historical events in Palestine during 
  this time, although twenty years later the Jews revolted against their despotic 
  Seleucid Greek ruler. Historians usually date the Teacher of Righteousness to 
  around the beginning of the first century B.C.E., after the Maccabean victory 
  against the Seuclid Greeks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;According to the Damascus Document, 
  God raised up the Righteous Teacher 390 years after the exile in order to restore 
  Israel from its period of disobedience. This would be achieved through a faithful 
  remnant to whom God had revealed his purposes. The majority of Israel will continue 
  to disobey the law, but the Teacher will - through the priests and Levites who 
  left their roles in the Jerusalem Temple and its establishment - restore the 
  true sons of Zadok, the elect of Israel. The Damascus Document builds on the 
  imagery of Yahweh's instruction to Moses at Beer (Num 21:18): the well from 
  which they are to draw is the law; the stave is the interpreter of the law,

  literally? Rather it is more likely that 'Damascus' is a code word for Qumran....The 
  New Testament pictures Paul receiving a vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus 
  (Acts 9:3-6). It is likely that the symbolic meaning of Damascus as an eschatological 
  stopover would have led to its use here. Indeed, even in Amos 5:27 it is connected

  &quot;refers to various groups or chapters scattered throughout Palestine. Therefore 
  it did not attach itself specifically to the site of Qumran...This text does 
  not merely reflect a small community living there.&quot; &quot;The present text

  becomes clear by comparison with charters from elsewhere in the contemporary

  Manual of Discipline reflects one distinct radicalizing trend within this group

  and overriding purity-discipline...Some other scrolls, such as the Rules of

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 'standing of Israel' in 
  Exodus 19 served as a kind of model for the life of the Qumran community and 
  'justified their attempt to apply the rules of priestly purity to the lay members 
  as well. Everyone had to be as holy as the priests serving before God. The organization 
  of Israel at Mount Sinai -the division of elders (Ex 19:7; cf. 1QS 6.8), priests, 
  and laymen (Ex 19:21-22) in groups of ten, fifty, and one hundred (Ex 18:21); 
  living in camps (Ex 19:2); and the necessary ritual purity and abstinence from 
  sexual intercourse (Ex 19:14-15) - was followed at Qumran and instituted as 
  a permanent order of the life of the community in expectation of the second 
  coming of God. Hence, the ideal of becoming a kingdom of priests and a holy 
  people (Ex 19:6) was pursued at Qumran. <br>
  &quot;The well-known words in Exodus 19:8 should be considered the origin of 
  the self-designation yahad (togetherness, union). In this passage Israel 'together' 
  (yahdaw) made the following promise: 'Everything that the Lord says we will 
  do!' Everyone who joined the Qumran yahad and entered the covenant had to confirm 
  by an oath the obligation 'to return to the law according to everything that 
  is commanded with his whole heart and soul' (lQS 5.8-9); one had to live and 
  to pray 'together' (yahad; 1QS 6.2-3).&quot; </font>- Otto Betz, &quot;Jesus

  nation in its thousands would participate, with the priests and Levites - newly

  leading roles in ceremonies meant in effect to inaugurate a new covenant, based

  Covenant, and the Covenant of Justice. Believers are presently living in an 
  era when Satan (here called Belial) rules the world. The New Testament terms 
  Satan 'the Prince of this world.' Ultimately, that fact explains why believers,

  the destinies of all living creatures, and their ultimate actions and fate cannot 
  be changed. But in creating mankind, he put two spirits - one of truth and the 
  other of perversion - in its charge: Truth has its source in a 'dwelling place 
  of light', while wickedness derives from a 'source of darkness'; the 'chieftain 
  of lights' has dominion over all the sons of righteousness, while the 'angel

  it is due to this same influence of the angel of darkness. Nonetheless, although 
  having Himself created these two opposing angelic spirits, 'the Lord of Israel 
  and the angel of His truth aid all sons of light' - the Lord loving the one 
  spirit and hating the other. Those of humble mien, we are told, thereby possess 
  all desirable moral and spiritual virtues - slowness to anger, mercifulness,

  &quot;From pertinent hints and suggestions in both the Pesher and the Covenant, 
  it appears that the Teacher began his oppositional career by preaching against 
  the Jerusalem establishment, whom he accused of deceit, graft, exploitation 
  of the poor, and failure to understand the true meaning of the prophetic writings. 
  As the Pesher indicates, he was eventually banished from the capital; in the 
  end, as we learn from the Covenant, he made his way to the Damascus region in 
  the company of some or all of his followers, who - either there or upon returning 
  to Judea - gathered the Teacher's literary remains and enlarged exegetically 
  upon them. These followers, along with others, would carry on the salient features 
  of his teachings - abhorrence of priestly corruption, protection of the poor, 
  AND EMPHASIS ON THE SEARCH FOR THE TRUE MEANING OF THE TORAH AND PROPHETS. These 
  ideas were transformed into spiritual ideals within the framework of the concept 
  of purity-holiness. The new conceptual structure was then developed and given 
  literary life by a group of relatively sophisticated religious thinkers who 
  eventually recorded their doctrines and practices in works such as the Manual 
  of Discipline.&quot; </font>- Norman Golb, Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls?,

  the word 'Nozrim', one of the earliest Hebrew designations for the sect subsequently 
  known as 'Christians'. The modern Arabic word for Christians, 'Nasrani', derives 
  from the same source. So, too, does the word 'Narorean', or 'Nazarene', which,

  OF HOLIES FOR AARON (lQS 8.5-6). This holy house and living sanctuary was eschatologically 
  significant. It could neither be destroyed nor shaken in the coming catastrophe 
  of judgment; its walls and foundations will not move from their place (lQS 8.7-8). 
  And God was being praised as the builder of a city on the rock that cannot be 
  swallowed by the gates of hell ([Thanksgiving Psalm] lQH 6.24-29).</font></p>

  is quoted, combined with other biblical passages, and related to the end of 
  days. God will establish a sanctuary (cf. Ex 15:17-18 in line 3) which no strangers, 
  such as Moabites or Ammonites will enter (see Deut 23:3 in line 4); only holy 
  ones are there. This sanctuary will never be destroyed, unlike the first Temple, 
  which fell because of the sins of Israel (line 5). God had commanded 'to build 
  for him a sanctuary of men (miqdas 'adam) so that they will offer him words 
  of the law as incense before him' (line 6).....This promise is preceded by an 
  exegesis of 2 Samuel 7:10 ('I will appoint a place for my people Israel... and

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Copper Scroll was discovered 
  in Cave 3 in March 1955 and was a genuine autograph text rather than a copy 
  of an original. &quot;The 'Copper Scroll' lists huge amounts of gold, silver 
  precious objects and at least twenty-four scrolls within the Temple. Directions 
  are given to sixty-one different caches; the following are typical of listings:&quot; 
  </font> - Christopher Knight &amp; Robert Lomas, The Hiram Key: Pharaohs, Freemasons 
  and the Discovery of the Secret Scrolls of Jesus </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Examples of the caches include: &quot;In 
  the cistern which is nineteen cubits in front of the eastern gateway, in it 
  are vessels, and in the hollow that is in it: ten talents. &quot;In the Court 
  of [?]..., nine cubits under the southern corner: god and silver vessels for 
  tithe, sprinkling basins, cups, sacrificial bowls, libation vessels, in all 
  six hundred and nine.&quot;<br>
  &quot;In the inner chamber of the twin pillars supporting the arch of the double 
  gate, facing east, in the entrance, buried at three cubits, hidden there is 
  a pitcher, in it, one scroll, under it forty-two talents. - Copper Scroll 3Q15

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Remarkably, the pattern of 
  clauses in the Copper Scroll formulary finds precise parallels in Greek temple 
  inventories from the Isle of Delos. These texts, most of which date between 
  180 and 90 B.C.E., were records kept by the priests of the island's temple of 
  Apollo. They detail large numbers of votive objects brought to the temple, including 
  crowns, jugs, earrings, and coins....Copper was used for the safekeeping of 
  nonliterary records, Roman public laws, and even the private discharge papers 
  of Roman military veterans. More to the point, copper and bronze were common 
  media of choice for the archival records of temples in the Roman period.&quot;

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus the Copper Scroll appears to 
  be an official Temple document and gives 64 different locations for treasures 
  from the Temple in Jerusalem. If the Copper Scroll with its Greek loan words, 
  is of 1st century origin, it may be the actual inventory of treasures which 
  were hidden before the destruction of of the Temple in 70 C.E. and lost ever 
  since. &quot;John Allegro's interpretation of the 'Copper Scroll' indicated 
  that there was at least one other copy, deposited in the Temple itself:&quot;

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;...In at least eight passages, 
  writings are mentioned as being buried adjacent to the treasures. &quot;One 
  of the most notable such passages is the statement (first seven lines in column 
  7) that one is to dig at the northern opening of the 'Cave of the Pillar', three 
  cubits downward, where an amphora containing a scroll (Hebrew, sefer) is to 
  be found, and, underneath it, forty-two silver talents. Strikingly, this passage 
  follows another to the effect that thirty-two talents have been hidden in a 
  tomb located at the 'Brook of the Dome...as (one) comes from Jericho [seven 
  miles from Qumran] to Sekhakha'.&quot;<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yet more notable is the statement 
  at the beginning of column 8 that scrolls (sefarin,, plural), have been hidden 
  along with ritual vessels at an aqueduct, also apparently located near Jericho. 
  Other 'writings' (Hebrew, ketab; plural, ketabin) are mentioned as being placed 
  near hidden treasures in at least five other passages of the scroll. These may 
  have been documentary records specifying the various treasures placed near them, 
  just as the Copper Scroll itself is designated as a ketab - not a sefer - at 
  the end of the final column...These facts are...readily explainable on the basis 
  of movements of the hides from the capital eastward to several areas of the 
  Judean Wilderness: first, to locations near Jericho; then, as the Roman buildup 
  there proceeded in the months prior to the onset of the siege on the capital, 
  to caves south of the Wadi Mukallik (Caves 3, 11, 1, and 2); and eventually,

  historian [Josephus] tells us that this man delivered up to the Romans 'the 
  tunics and girdles worn by the priests...along with a mass of cinnamon and cassia 
  and a multitude of other spices...many other treasures also were delivered up 
  by him, with numerous sacred ornaments' (War 6.390-91). Phineas led the Romans 
  to hidden treasures from the Temple-perhaps including some that were listed 
  in the Copper Scroll. A second passage of Josephus's War notes that as a result 
  of the recovery and subsequent release of loot by the Romans, the standard of 
  gold throughout Syria fell to half its previous value. The spoils of war were

  and the 'domicile of the queen' (probably the palace of Queen Salome in the 
  vicinity of Jericho). Significantly, all the locations mentioned in the Copper 
  Scroll fall neatly within the boundaries of Judea during the time of Alexander 
  Jannaeus and shortly thereafter. To my mind this suggests a hiding of treasures 
  in the wake of the exile from Jerusalem of the (arguably Sadducean) allies of 
  Jannaeus during the time of Salome and Hyrkanus. We also have reference to a 
  'garden of Zadok' near Jerusalem, suggesting a special reverence of Zadok by

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Exhortation that begins the Damascus 
  Document of the Dead Sea Scrolls prefaces the theology of the Qumran community. 
  Namely, it explains how God leaves the Temple and sends the Babylonians to punish 
  those who have polluted the Sanctuary and abandoned the Temple. However, God 
  leaves a remnant who will one day return to the land of Israel once the people 
  learn to correctly follow Mosaic Law. But the true mark of God&#146;s benevolence 
  is in the guide he sends: &quot;And God observed their deeds, that they sought 
  Him with a whole heart, and He raised for them a Teacher of Righteousness to 
  guide them in the way of his heart.&quot;1 Here, God raises this Teacher from 
  the remnant of Israel and makes him a guide for the people. For the Teacher 
  must not only guide the remnant through the desert, but he must show it the 
  path of Righteousness to bring about the end of days: the end of days comes 
  with proper ordering of society and return of Israel to her rightful descendants. 
  But who is this Teacher of Righteousness? He is a prophet with God-given ability 
  to interpret the Law. In this paper, I will try to provide a basic description 
  of the Teacher by looking at references to him in the Scrolls and by paying 
  close attention to the Pesherim and Hodayot. I will then explore the nature 
  of his apocalypticism. I hope that by progressing in this manner I will shed 
  light on the nature of this elusive character, the Teacher of Righteousness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">References to the Teacher in the 
  Dead Sea Scrolls</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As E.P. Sanders begins his quest 
  for the historical Jesus,2 he explains that the best place to begin is with 
  the facts. Likewise, as we try to understand the Teacher of Righteousness (T 
  of R), it is preferable to begin with what we know about the Teacher from the 
  Dead Sea Scrolls themselves. Authors of the scrolls know the Teacher as Teacher, 
  Teacher of the Community, Teacher of Righteousness,3 Interpreter, Interpreter 
  of the Law,4 Priest,5 The Priest.6 He is never explicitly referred to as prophet, 
  but descriptions, context, and tradition lead one to believe that the Teacher 
  is in fact a prophet. The Damascus Document (CD), the Commentary on Micah, the 
  Commentary on Habakkuk, and the Commentary on Psalms use the titles Teacher, 
  Teacher of the Community, and Teacher of Righteousness. From such passages, 
  we learn that the Teacher is the founder of the community7 and that the present 
  generation of the community looks to him as an historical authority. In all 
  of these references, the Teacher, Teacher of the Community, and Teacher of Righteousness 
  is a figure divinely chosen to expound the Law and set Community members on 
  the righteous path for the end of days.8 His words help prepare for the end:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who have listened to the voice of 
  the Teacher of Righteousness and have not despised the precepts of righteousness 
  when they heard them; they shall rejoice and their hearts shall be strong, and 
  they shall prevail over all the sons of the earth. God will forgive them and 
  they shall see His salvation because they took refuge in His holy name. (CD 
  XIII, 30-5)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, the Teacher of Righteousness 
  is one who dispels the &#145;precepts of righteousness&#146; which one must 
  follow in order to reach salvation. God speaks through the Teacher so that those 
  listening to the Teacher follow God&#146;s words and receive His salvation. 
  Moreover, the Teacher speaks God&#146;s words when he interprets divine scripture; 
  the DSS knows the Teacher as &#145;Interpreter of the Law&#146; in documents 
  such as The Community Rule, the Damascus Document, the Commentary on Habakkuk, 
  and Midrash on the Last Days. The fact that the Teacher is the authority on 
  the Law reflects his role in the community because the Law is pivotal to the 
  Community. In the Thanksgiving Hymns, for instance, the Teacher refers to himself 
  as having the waters of the Covenant confirmed in his heart for those who seek 
  it, for God has &#145;hidden Thy Law [within (him)].&#146;9 In this passage, 
  the Teacher of Righteousness not only knows the Law, but his knowledge of the 
  Law is given to him by God. As in Numbers 12:6-8 when Moses receives the Law 
  mouth to mouth from God, the Teacher also receives the law from the mouth of 
  God in 1 Qp Hab II 2-3. The community respects the T of R&#146;s legal understanding 
  and uses his interpretations for redemption: </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But all those who hold fast to these 
  precepts and coming in accordance with the Law, who heed the voice of the Teacher 
  and confess before God, saying, &#145;Truly we have sinned... by walking counter 
  to the precepts of the covenant&#146;...; they shall rejoice and their hearts 
  shall be strong. (CD 28-30)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, members of the CD Community 
  that listen to the T of R and follow his teachings will rejoice in the eschaton. 
  Lastly, the teacher is referred to explicitly as a priest in the pesher on Ps 
  37:23-24. These references to the Teacher in the DSS as a Teacher of Righteousness, 
  an Interpreter of the Law, and a Priest paint the most general, most undeniable 
  portrait of the Teacher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pesherim: Interpretations of the 
  Law</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pesherim10 are interpretations 
  of written prophetic texts that can be understood as &#145;unraveling of mysteries.&#146;11 
  J. Carmignac broke the pesherim into two categories: continuous, which interpret 
  a single book section by section, and thematic, which consist of certain citations 
  grouped around a thematic idea.12 Both of these forms of pesherim are characterized 
  by raz, a term taken from the notion of the ancient prophets being introduced 
  in their visions into the heavenly assembly of special knowledge.13 However, 
  the pesherim take the idea of divine prophetic revelation a step further, because 
  they claim to contain the mystery of things hidden even to the prophets themselves 
  who wrote the words now interpreted. Horgan points to 1 QpHab 7:4-5 as an example 
  of this: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and God told Habakkuk 
  to write down that which would happen to the final generation, but He did not 
  make known to him when time would come to an end. And as for that which He said, 
  That he who reads may read it speedily: interpreted this concerns the Teacher 
  of Righteousness, to whom God made known all the mysteries of the words of His 
  servants the Prophets. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this pesher, the Teacher understands 
  what is to come because God allows him to unravel the mystery of Habakkuk&#146;s 
  prophecy; namely that within the words, God buries his plans for the founding 
  of the community, the rise of the Teacher, and the end of days. Once God gives 
  the Teacher prophetic understanding, the Teacher unravels the mystery in scripture 
  and he uses that new knowledge to create rules which will regulate the Community. 
  In this manner, the entire Community order, every rule, every hierarchical position, 
  is governed by the Teacher&#146;s interpretation of scripture in anticipation 
  for the end of days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, because the Teacher is 
  the Interpreter of the Law, the pesherim provide additional insight into the 
  Teacher. That is, these pesherim are the Teacher&#146;s mode of divine revelation 
  via interpretation of scripture. By carefully examining how the Teacher interprets 
  scripture, one can learn even more about the figure. For instance, in the Commentary 
  on Habakkuk: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Behold the nations 
  and see, marvel and be astonished; for I accomplish a deed in your days, but 
  you will not believe it when] told. They, the men of violence and the breakers 
  of the Covenant, will not believe when they hear all that [is to happen to] 
  the final generation from the Priest [in whose heart] God set [understanding] 
  that he might interpret all the words of His servants the Prophets, through 
  whom He foretold all that would happen to his people and [His land]. (1QpHab 
  II, 5-10)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the passage, the Teacher is a 
  priest who has the divine power to interpret Scripture, namely the Prophetic 
  Books. Moreover, the Teacher prefers the Prophets because God imparted them 
  with the knowledge of what is to come in the generation of the Teacher. The 
  Teacher is given knowledge by God to understand these prophets so he can likewise 
  teach the people righteousness and prevent their destruction at the end of days. 
  This passage reveals much about the Community&#146;s theology of prophecy. The 
  Teacher was chosen long ago by God to prepare the remnant for the end of days; 
  the prophets were likewise sent generations ago to prepare for this event.14 
  When the Teacher interprets the Law, he is more similar to the biblical Prophets 
  in his mode of revelation than a scribe or a midrashic rabbi. Unlike the rabbis, 
  the Teacher does not rely on the peshat or derash. His interpretations are more 
  than mere allegories of text, but at the same time, they are not visions as 
  the ancient prophets experienced them. Additionally, the Teacher is different 
  from other exegetes because he does not merely apply scripture to his situation, 
  but rather claims that scripture is written with him in mind. Based on the manner 
  in which he interprets scripture, we can generalize that the Teacher is similar 
  to the prophets, but also unique in his own right. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By examining stylistic features 
  such as use of the first person pronoun, content, and linguistic uniformity, 
  three German scholars derived a criteria that distinguishes hymns written by 
  the Teacher from those written by the community at a later date. Gert Jeremias, 
  Jurgen Becker, and Heinz-Wolfgang Kuhn18 individually note the following: that 
  in many of the hymns, the use of &#145;I&#146; speaks passionately about personal 
  experiences; that these hymns often deal with individual accounts of dire need 
  or use the motif of the mediator of revelation;19 and that these hymns are historical 
  and specific, rather than theological and general, with regard to language. 
  These scholars then designated such hymns as written by the Teacher of Righteousness 
  himself; they are &#145;Teacher hymns&#146; as opposed to Community hymns or 
  didactic hymns. But such an explanation cries out for an example. Take the following 
  passage:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They have banished me from my land 
    <br>
    like a bird from its nest;<br>
    all my friends and brethren are driven far from me<br>
    and hold me for a broken vessel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they, teachers of lies and 
    seers of falsehood,<br>
    have schemed against me a devilish scheme,<br>
    to exchange the Law engraved on my heart by Thee<br>
    for the smooth things (which they speak) to Thy people.<br>
    And they withhold from the thirsty the drink of Knowledge, and assuage their 
    thirst with vinegar,<br>
    that they may gaze on their straying,<br>
    on their folly concerning feast-days,<br>
    on their fall into their snares.<br>
    (1 QH IV, 7-12)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In contrast to &#145;teachers of 
  lies and seers of falsehood&#146;, the Teacher is a teacher of truth and a seer 
  of righteousness. The Teacher&#146;s truth, which is &#145;engraved on his heart&#146; 
  by God, is emphasized by the fact that those who are able to receive knowledge 
  do so by drinking it. The reader also learns about the concerns of the Teacher 
  from his final charge against the teachers of lies: the author of the hymn worries 
  about the timing of the feasts.20 For the following reasons, this passage fulfills 
  the description of the typical Teacher hymn as set out by Jeremias, Becker, 
  and Kuhn: 1. the Teacher uses the first person to relay his personal situation; 
  2. the Teacher, who is set apart because God engraved truth in his heart, is 
  full of woe; 3. the Teacher uses specifics, such as his calendar concerns, that 
  do not speak to the general problems of mankind. Because this hymn is so personal, 
  so moving, and so specific, it does not seem likely that it could have been 
  written by anyone other than the Teacher.21 Moreover, once we recognize the 
  components of this hymn as characteristic of the Teacher, we get a better sense 
  of his agenda and how he views himself. Based on the facts of the hymn, God 
  grants the Teacher divine understanding of the Law for the imparting of this 
  Law to those &#145;thirsty&#146; for righteousness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Teacher is not the Lawgiver, 
  but rather the Interpreter of the Law. Instead of creating his own law, the 
  Teacher uses his divine power to understand biblical scripture...The fact that 
  the Teacher is not the author of the Temple Scroll makes it easier to understand 
  how the Teacher does not write the Law for the end of days, but that another 
  figure is to come.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who is the Teacher of Righteousness? 
  <i>Who is this son of man?</i> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Difficulties arise when one tries 
  to describe the Teacher of Righteousness; however, the complexity that most 
  affects the description deals with whether to place the figure in the past or 
  in the future. Many point to this ambiguity in a midrash of Num 21:18 that is 
  in the Damascus Document.26 Unlike other passages in the same document, the 
  figure mentioned here is in the future. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The well is the Law, and those who 
  dug it were the converts of Israel who went out of the land of Judah to sojourn 
  in the land of Damascus....The Staff is the Interpreter of the Law of whom Isaiah 
  said, He makes a tool for His work; and the nobles of the peoples are those 
  who come to dig the well with the staffs with which the staff ordained that 
  they should walk in all age of wickedness- and without them they shall find 
  nothing- until he comes who shall teach righteousness at the end of days. (CD, 
  VI)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, confusion arises because the 
  titles &#145;Interpreter of the Law&#146; and &#145;Teacher of Righteousness&#146; 
  are interchangeable.27 The Teacher must have a role in both the past and the 
  future: he is a figure of the community&#146;s past as its founder and writer 
  of its law. But, the law he writes is pertinent to the eschaton, for by following 
  this law as divinely interpreted by the Teacher, community members can bring 
  about the endtime. This &#145;dual&#146; nature of the Teacher, however, should 
  not be overexaggerated. The Teacher himself is in no way a messianic figure. 
  He will not return at the endtime, but he does anticipate the arrival of his 
  eschatological counterpart.28 It should also be made clear in the initial stages 
  of this inquiry what the Teacher of Righteousness is not: he is not John the 
  Baptist, he is not Jesus Christ </font>(think of Paul..Galatians 1:15,16...See 
  the chapter entitled Elisha ben Abuyah)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
  and we cannot attribute a specific, personal name to him.29 But, the reader 
  can paint a general portrait of the Teacher. Based on the way the Teacher interprets 
  the Law in the Pesherim and the way he describes his experiences in the Hodayot, 
  it seems that he is priest who writes divinely inspired interpretations of the 
  Law. He is a figure in the past who prepares his community for the imminent 
  end.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Teacher as the Community&#146;s 
  Founder</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The passage mentioned earlier offers 
  several assumptions about the historical Teacher: The well is the Law, and those 
  who dug it were converts of Israel who went out of the land of Judah to sojourn 
  in the land of Damascus...The Staff is the Interpreter of the Law of whom Isaiah 
  said, He makes a tool for His work.... (CD, VI) </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
  offers possibilities for the identity of the Teacher by putting the Teacher 
  in the context of his own Community. Here, it can be assumed that the founding 
  of the Community has a great deal to do with the Law itself; the founders left 
  Judah and went into Damascus for this &quot;well,&quot; the Law. The metaphor 
  of the well as the Law is powerful: the well offers essential water that cannot 
  be found in Judah. Ironically, the water is found in the desert. Of further 
  irony is that even though the converts themselves dig this well in Damascus, 
  they are still not able to find the well, the Law. Only the Staff, the Interpreter 
  of the Law, finds the water. We now have a full picture of the Teacher: the 
  Teacher helps found a community that left Judah because the Law is not able 
  to &#145;exist&#146; there. The Teacher interprets the Law for the community, 
  thus making it &#145;drinkable.&#146; Here, the reader is offered a number of 
  roles for the Teacher. In this section, I will build on this portrait. I will 
  explain how the Teacher and the community see the Teacher as a priest and a 
  prophet who experiences revelation in the mode of divine interpretation of Law.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Teacher as Priest</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The evidence clearly shows that the 
  T of R is a priest: this is explicit in textual evidence and suggested contextually 
  based on the T of R&#146;s concerns. For instance, in the pesher on Ps 37:23-24 
  (4QpPs 1-10 iii 15): The steps of the man are confirmed by the Lord and He delights 
  in all his ways; though [he stumbles, he shall not fall, for the Lord shall 
  support his hand] (23-4). Interpreted, this concerns the Priest, the Teacher 
  [of Righteousness] whom God chose to stand before Him, for He established him 
  to build for Himself the congregation of (Israel) </font>(Understand Zechariah, 
  chapter 3...KJV)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">... </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, the Teacher is a priest who 
  establishes the Community based on the will of God: the priest is chosen by 
  God. As a priest, the Teacher is concerned with purity and the proper ordering 
  of the Temple. Moreover, he behaves as a priest when the reader sees him on 
  a more personal level. This is evident throughout the Thanksgiving Hymns, many 
  of which can be typed as introspective confessions in the style of the priest-prophet 
  Jeremiah. It is also clear that the Teacher is a priest based on the way priests 
  are regarded throughout the Dead Sea Scrolls. Members of the Council of the 
  Community (the elect of Israel) are known as sons of Zadok, the Priests; the 
  Law of Moses has been revealed to these men.30 God raises these priests and 
  they will be called by name at the end of days.31 The priests act as God&#146;s 
  counsel, so that &#145;the man who does not listen but acts arrogantly without 
  obeying the priest who is posted there to minister before [God]...that man shall 
  die.&#146;32 Clearly, the priests are the authority in the community. It is 
  then logical to assume that the Teacher, as the eminent authority figure who 
  most probably wrote this passage, would also be a priest. Although this piece 
  of information helps the reader better understand the Teacher, it begs the question: 
  how is the Teacher different from the other priests in the community? The next 
  section addresses just that point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">High Priest?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The question has also been raised 
  as to whether the Teacher was the High Priest of the Temple before escaping 
  into the desert. On this question, scholars point to historical reconstruction 
  and passages discussing the Teacher&#146;s struggle with the Wicked Priest . 
  Indirect evidence here leads many to conclude that the Teacher is a High Priest 
  and that the Scrolls are primarily concerned with restoring a legitimate priest. 
  However, this evidence is not conclusive. Based on the text, it is more reasonable 
  to say that the Teacher struggles with the High Priest over purity rules, rather 
  than for a power position or restoration of a &#145;legitimate&#146; High Priest. 
  More likely, the T of R was at one time a prophet in the Temple who was not 
  popular with Temple authority because of his views on contentious issues of 
  the day; this authority most likely drove him into exile. The Teacher thus laments 
  over the Temple because Temple authorities do not follow the purity laws as 
  dictated by God through Moses...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The argument explaining why the Teacher 
  was at one point High Priest of the Temple is based on speculation after speculation; 
  it is historically implausible and it misunderstands the Teacher&#146;s message. 
  A better understanding of the Teacher can be achieved through the Scrolls. For 
  instance, 1 QpHab 11:4-8 describes how the Wicked Priest pursues the Teacher 
  to his place of exile and then attempts to disrupt his Day of Atonement. Of 
  note, this passage shows that the Wicked Priest and the Teacher observe different 
  calendars. It is unlikely that the Teacher was the High Priest if he was observing 
  his own cultic calendar, because he would not have switched calendars in Qumran 
  and Jonathan would not have introduced a new calendar in 152 BC.37 Moreover, 
  there is no evidence in the text even to support that the Wicked Priest is not 
  legitimate. The Teacher, however, repeatedly shows concerns over other issues 
  of impurity. Notably, the Teacher names three types of impurity that profane 
  the land: fornication, riches, and profanation of the Temple. Included among 
  those things that profane the Temple are menstrual blood, incestuous relationships, 
  and a breach of the Mosaic Covenant....This charismatic figure blames the Wicked 
  Priest for polluting the Temple through the priest&#146;s inappropriate behavior. 
  In 1 QpHab 12:1-10, the Wicked Priest plots the destruction of the poor, commits 
  abominable deeds, and defiles the Temple. Rather than planning an insurrection 
  or attempt to overthrow the High Priest, the T of R condemns the Wicked Priest 
  to an eschatological punishment. In this manner, the T of R fits the model of 
  a prophet acting outside of the court.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Teacher as Prophet</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the Teacher does not share 
  many of the traits that the ancient prophets hold in common, he is clearly a 
  prophet; his visions can be understood as a correct understanding or ordering 
  of words through divine revelation of scripture. In this sense, the Teacher 
  sees more. On the most basic level, the Teacher is unlike the other prophets 
  because he does not have visions that come in the form of dream-like scenes&#151;However, 
  a deeper understanding of the meaning of prophecy shows that the Teacher is 
  similar to the biblical prophets. Otto Betz compares the Teacher&#146;s divine 
  revelation of scripture to Daniel&#146;s interpretation of dreams and concludes 
  that pesher and apocalypse are quite similar.39 Moreover, Betz notes that both 
  the Teacher and Daniel use the term raz to help describe the mystery of their 
  interpretations. A clear parallel can be seen when Daniel interprets the writings 
  on the wall at Belshazzar&#146;s feast.40 Here, only Daniel is able to interpret 
  the writings of a supernatural author. Moreover, he dissects the inscription 
  so as to give an interpretation based on each word, similar to the Teacher&#146;s 
  manner of interpreting the prophets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Teacher is similar to the other 
  prophets both in his manner of interpretation and the reasons behind his revelation. 
  In the following passage, the Teacher is similar to the prophets in a number 
  of ways:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And they, teachers of lies and 
    seers of falsehood, <br>
    have schemed against me a devilish scheme,<br>
    to exchange the Law engraved on my heart...<br>
    for the smooth things (which they speak) to Thy people.<br>
    And they withhold from the thirsty the drink of Knowledge, and assuage their 
    thirst with vinegar... <br>
    (1 QH IV, 8-10)</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But there were false prophets also among the people, even 
    as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable 
    heresies, even denying the Lord that brought them, and bring upon themselves 
    swift destruction.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And many shall follow their pernicious ways: by reason 
    of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And through covetousness shall they with feigned words 
    make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, 
    and their damnation slumbereth not...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 Peter, 
    chapter 2; The Book of Jude; Ezekiel 13).</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For the time will come when they will not endure sound 
    doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap unto themselves teachers, 
    having itching ears...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 Timothy 4:3; 1 Samuel 
    2:35; 3:11-14). </font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, 
    that they shall believe a lie...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 Thessalonians 
    2:11,12). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like the Staff, the Teacher is needed 
  by those thirsty for knowledge. In this passage, we also see that the Teacher&#146;s 
  righteousness is not fully human; because the Law is engraved on his heart by 
  God, his interpretation of the Law is a divine interpretation.41 God has given 
  the Teacher the power to &#145;interpret all the words of his servants the prophets&#146;42 
  and then God feeds the Teacher His words by which to prophesy.43 Here, the relationship 
  between God and the Teacher is inextricably close; like the prophets Jeremiah 
  and Ezekiel, the Teacher cannot escape his righteousness, despite the distress 
  it causes him.44 Moreover, the Teacher is similar to the other prophets in his 
  impetus for making the interpretations. Like Amos, Ezekiel, and Daniel, the 
  Teacher writes at a time of serious social turmoil. He attempts to solve this 
  turmoil by urging a new world order.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Teacher&#146;s Role in the End 
  of Days</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the question concerning the 
  identity of the Teacher of Righteousness was initially asked, the following 
  passage was used as an example: The nobles of the peoples are those who come 
  to dig the well with staffs with which the staff ordained that they should walk 
  in all age of wickedness- and without them they shall find nothing- until he 
  comes who shall teach righteousness at the end of days. (CD, VI)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The eschaton cannot take place until 
  there is a proper ordering of Society in the World:45 namely, Jerusalem must 
  be the religious capital of the world (Isaiah 7, 9, 11); Temple Worship must 
  be correct; Israel must not be dominated by foreign oppressors; and society 
  must have just ownership of land.46 Evidence throughout this paper seems to 
  show that the Teacher of Righteousness extracts principles to regulate the Community 
  as God aids him in interpreting scripture. Through these regulations, a proper 
  order is established and the eschaton is realized.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, the Teacher of Righteousness 
  does not take part in the end of days himself. Instead, he prepares the way 
  for the eschatological messiahs. He sets the standard for interpretation of 
  scripture which the Priestly Messiah, who takes the Teacher&#146;s place in 
  interpretation of the Law, relies on at the end of days. </font>(Our author 
  seems to be a little mixed up here, and does not see the whole picture yet)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
  The following passage will first help the reader understand the messianic expectation 
  of the community:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The king is the congregation; and 
  the bases of the statutes are the Books of the Prophets whose saying Israel 
  despised. The star is the Interpreter of the Law who shall come to Damascus; 
  as it is written, A star shall come forth out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise 
  out of Israel (Num xxiv, 17). The scepter is the Prince of the whole congregation 
  and when he comes he shall smite all the children of Seth (Num. xxiv, 17). [CD 
  VII, 15-20]</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, two messiahs emerge at the 
  end of days: the Interpreter of the law, or Priest-Messiah, and the Prince of 
  the whole congregation, the Davidic Messiah.47 These figures are also referred 
  to throughout the DSS as the messiahs of Aaron and Israel. They are not equal 
  counter-parts: the Priest-Messiah has precedence over the Davidic Messiah in 
  all legal matters: &#145;As they teach him so shall he judge&#146;.48 This precedence 
  can be seen in passages from the community rule; &#145;When the table has been 
  prepared for eating, and the new wine for drinking, the Priest shall be the 
  first to stretch out his hand to bless the first-fruits of the bread and new 
  wine.&#146;49 </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here, the Messiah of Aaron takes 
  precedence because he is the eschatological high priest who teaches righteousness 
  at the end of days.50 Although the Prince of the Congregation presides over 
  the battle liturgy (1 QM XV, 4; XVI, 13; XVIII) and the eschatological banquet 
  (1 QSa II, 12-21),51 the Messiah of Aaron is more important for understanding 
  the Teacher of Righteousness because he is the one who continues the Teacher&#146;s 
  message. The arrival of the Messiahs of Aaron and Israel marks the eschatological 
  turning point; once they arrive, the Messiah of Aaron interprets the Law.52 
  His legacy in the community is the basic interpretation of the Law that functions 
  at the end of days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is the Teacher an Apocalyptic Figure?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An analysis of all the literature 
  that has ever been regarded as &#145;apocalyptic&#146; was printed in Semeia 
  14 to show the extent and limits of the category &#145;apocalyptic literature.&#146; 
  The following features were identified as common to apocalypses: a narrative 
  framework that describes the revelation; the main means of revelation as visions 
  and otherworldly visions; presence of an angel who interprets the vision; disclosure 
  of a transcendent reality which is temporal (eschatological salvation); transcendent 
  reality which is spatial (involves another, supernatural world).54 Based on 
  these criteria, it would appear that the Teacher does not write apocalypses. 
  That is, the T of R is not a visionary.55 Unlike many figures in apocalypses, 
  he does not resort to using a pseudonym. Such a phenomenon can be explained 
  based on the charismatic nature of the Teacher: the Teacher is able to rest 
  on his own authority. Also, the Teacher bases his interpretations on older scripture 
  which gives him greater authority. Rather than an apocalypse, it may be more 
  accurate to say that the Qumran community is apocalyptic. According to John 
  Collins in &#145;The Apocalyptic Genre,&#146; Qumran fits the criteria for apocalypticism 
  as the ideology of a movement: it shares the conceptual framework of the genre 
  and endorses a world view in which supernatural revelation, the heavenly world, 
  and eschatological judgement play essential parts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Summary and Conclusion</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although we cannot say a great deal 
  concerning the Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls, we are able 
  to paint a general portrait of this Teacher. Based on references to the Teacher 
  throughout the Scrolls, we learn that he is a priest and the interpreter of 
  the Law. Moreover, by reading the pesherim, or interpretations of the Law, and 
  the Hodayot actually written by the Teacher, it becomes clear that the Teacher 
  is a prophet whose mode of revelation is divine interpretation of scripture. 
  Within this mold, the Teacher has a role in both the Community&#146;s past and 
  future: he is a figure of the Community&#146;s past as its founder, but his 
  interpretation of the Law helps order society in anticipation for the two Messiahs 
  and the eschaton. </font></p>
<p>Notes </p>
<p>6 The Teacher is also referred to as &#145;the shepherd&#146; (1 Q11 VII, 20), 
  &#145;anointed one&#146; (1 Q11 II, 12), and possibly as &#145;judge&#146; (1QpHab 
  XIII, 2-3). But these references are not nearly as common as &#145;Teacher of 
  Righteousness&#146;, &#145;Interpreter of the Law&#146;, or &#145;Priest&#146;.</p>
<p>7 CD VIII, 22 and 15 seem to regard the Teacher as the founder of the Community.</p>
<p>8 The Teacher of Righteousness is one &#145;to whom God made known all the 
  mysteries of the words of His servants the Prophets&#146; (1QpHab VII, 16).</p>
<p>20 Unlike non-sectarian Judaism, the Qumran community used a calendar that 
  was based on the sun. The calendar issue was a great point of dissension. Geza 
  Vermes. The Dead Sea Scrolls in English. 43 I will expand on the issue when 
  I discuss hypotheses on the identity of the TR.</p>
<p>21 Such criteria, although helpful, is not a recipe for deciding the authorship 
  of hymns. For instance, Jeremias, Becker, and Kuhn do not indicate that this 
  passage was written by the TR, although the author uses the first person pronoun, 
  speaks of his woe, and seems to be a mediator of revelation:</p>
<p>For as a light from out of the darkness,<br>
  so wilt Thou enlighten me.<br>
  [Thou wilt bring healing to] my wound,<br>
  and marvelous might in place of my stumbling,<br>
  and everlasting space to my straitened soul. (1QH IX 25-30)</p>
<p>22 Michael Wise explains in &#145;The Temple Scroll and the Teacher of Righteousness&#146; 
  that the Temple Scroll has similar eschatological expectations as those held 
  by the CD community. He explains that &#145;the redactor of the TS was the T 
  of R whom the community had been awaiting.&#146; Thus, two major theories concerning 
  the authorship of the Temple Scroll seem to be these: first, the author can 
  be identified as the T of R by examining how he uses &#145;I/Thou&#146; terminology 
  and passages that are not based on scripture. Because this &#145;I-thou-they&#146; 
  formulation comes from Exodus, the author of 11 Q Torah must consider his work 
  to be similar to that of Exodus and he must consider himself to be a new Moses. 
  Second, the author can be identified by using redaction criticism of the TS 
  with regard to purity laws (cols. 45-50) and the Damascus Document. </p>
<p>&#145;The Temple Scroll and the Teacher of Righteousness&#146;, Mogliany 1989: 
  Papers on the Dead Sea Scrolls Offered in Memory of Jean Carmignac. (Krakow, 
  Enigma. 1991) 137</p>
<p>Wacholder claims that the same evidence that proves the T of R is the author 
  of the TS also explains the author&#146;s purpose; namely, to &#145;elevate 
  Moses from a mere legislator of the past to an anointed lawyer of the future&#146; 
  (p 29). He explains that this agenda is most evident when one examines use of 
  pronouns such as &#145;I&#146;, &#145;Thou&#146;, and &#145;They.&#146; For 
  instance:</p>
<p>They shall cry out but I will not listen; they shall scream but I will not 
  answer them because of their evil doings. I will hide my face from them and 
  they shall become food, plunder, and prey. None shall save them because of their 
  wickedness, because they have broken my covenant and their soul has loathed 
  my law until they have incurred every guilt. (1 QT LIX: 7-10)</p>
<p>Here, &#145;I&#146; refers to God and &#145;they&#146; refers to the remnant 
  of Israel. Although &#145;you&#146; is not used here, &#145;you&#146; in the 
  passages preceding and following this one refer to collective Israel. In passages 
  such as 1QT xII, &#145;you&#146; refers to Moses. It is not clear, however, 
  how this &#145;I-thou-you&#146; terminology helps prove that the T of R is the 
  author of the TS. It rather nicely shows the purpose of the scroll, though.</p>
<p>Ben Zion Wacholder. The Dawn of Qumran: The Sectarian Torah and the Teacher 
  of Righteousness. (NY, Hebrew Union College Press, 1989) 29<br>
  41 Dupont-Sommer noted a series of hymns in which the Teacher is was God&#146;s 
  servant: (XX III 18-19) (XIV, 25) (VII, 6-7) (XVII, 26). In these passages, 
  God&#146;s spirit is in the Teacher. Compare with Songs of the Servant Lord 
  in Isaiah. ibid., 365</p>
<p>44 The Teacher of Righteousness is in great despair. See 1QH V, 35-40: [Groaning] 
  and sorrow encompass me and ignominy covers my face. My bread is turned into 
  an adversary and my drink into an accuser; it has entered into my bones causing 
  my spirit to stagger and my strength to fail. Jeremiah also feels the pain of 
  his plight in his bones (Jer 23:9 &#145;My heart is broken, my bones all tremble&#146;). 
  Like Jeremiah, the T of R is a prophet in pain when the people do not heed his 
  [God&#146;s] words. 45 After the world is properly ordered, the eschaton is 
  still delayed until the War between the Children of Light and Children of Darkness. 
  However, this War against the Kittim as told in the War Scroll is beyond the 
  scope of this paper. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(See the chapter

  these texts [veiled references in the Dead Sea Scrolls to earlier history] describe 
  the times when Jewish patriots like the Maccabees fought the Hellenized High 
  Priests of the Temple and the vicious kings of Syria. One of these texts, known 
  as the War Scroll, tells of the battle that will take place at the end of time. 
  It describes precisely the ritual battle order, drawn up strictly in accordance 
  with the ancient Law, by which the Sons of Light will triumph over the Sons 
  of Darkness. The battle order lists everything from the specifications the field 
  latrines to the ages of baggage porters and the ritual order of advance that 
  will secure the final victory.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The War Scroll, like the Manual, 
  is not consistent in perspective: It appears to be made up of two or three sections

  It is suggested in the main section of the text that warfare will take place 
  over forty years, and encompass battles with most of the countries of the known

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;...What one seems to have reflected 
  in this Qumran literature is a Messianic elite retreating or 'separating' into 
  the wilderness as in Isaiah 40:3's 'make a straight Way in the Wilderness for 
  our God'. The &eacute;lite seems to have inhabited 'desert camps', where they 
  were actually 'preparing' to be joined by the Angels, referred to by them as 
  'the Heavenly Host', and for what appears to be a final apocalyptic Holy War 
  against all evil on this earth. </font>(See Revelation 12:7-11)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
  This would appear to be the reason they are practicing the regimen of extreme 
  purity in the wilderness in these texts - not the somewhat more retrospective 
  presentation in the New Testament as it has come down to us. This movement consists 
  of a small care of committed 'volunteers' or 'Joiners for war', or 'Holy Ones' 
  or 'Saints' - Messianic 'shock troops' if one prefers - preparing in the wilderness 
  through 'Perfection of the Way' and 'zeal for the Law for the time of the Day

  Uncovered </p>
<p>Christianity - a religion of duality </p>
<p>The idea of a cosmic war between good and evil is mirrored in all religions. 
  It is the battleground of the spirit as it loosens the shackles of materiality 
  - Armageddon and the Kurukshetra of the Bhagavad Gita. It operates at levels 
  far beyond our present comprehension. The Master DK says that: &quot;Just as 
  the planet called earth is regarded as the turning point or the battle-ground 
  between Spirit and matter, ...so our solar system holds an analogous place in 
  the cosmic scheme. The cosmic man, the solar Arjuna, is wrestling for His individualized 
  perfected self-consciousness, and for freedom and liberation from the form.... 
  So man on this planet battles for similar ideals on his tiny scale&quot;, so 
  battle in heaven Michael and His Angels ... Whose problem is the same on the 
  higher scale.&quot; (TCF, p.242) </p>
<p>Alice Bailey applies the concept to Christianity. &quot;Modern thinkers would 
  do well to remember that Christianity is a bridging religion. Herein lies its 
  great importance. Christianity is the religion of that transitional period which 
  links the era of self-conscious individualistic existence to a future group-conscious 
  unified world. It is outstandingly a religion of cleavage, demonstrating to 
  man his duality, and thus laying the foundation for his effort to achieve unity 
  or at-one-ment. </p>
<p>The realization of this duality is a most needed stage in man's unfoldment, 
  and the purpose of Christianity has been to reveal this; also to point out the 
  warfare between the lower and the higher man, between carnal man and spiritual 
  man, united in one person, and to emphasize the necessity for that lower man 
  to be saved by the higher.&quot; (FBC, pp.17-18)</p>
<p>The Temple Scroll </p>
<p>&quot;When Moses was close to death, he called to his side Joshua, the Son 
  of Nun, to bestow on him the succession of leadership and the care of his most 
  precious trust - the Books of Law, given by God to His people in the wilderness. 
</p>
<p>This He told Joshua: 'And receive thou this writing that thou mayest know how 
  to preserve the books which I shall deliver unto thee: and thou shalt set these 
  in order and anoint them with oil of cedar, and put them away in earthen vessels 
  ...until...the Lord will visit them in the consummation of the End of Days.'&quot; 
  - Assumption of Moses, an Apocryphal work. </p>
<p>When the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in the Judaean wilderness, carefully wrapped 
  in linen and preserved in earthenware jars, these words of Moses took on a brilliant 
  new meaning. Among the Jewish people there had always been the legend of a hidden 
  law, too stringent for most, but preserved in a secret tradition. In 2 Kings 
  22 we read of King Josiah who ordered repairs to the Temple of Yahweh. When 
  the carpenters found a book of Law and it was read in the King's presence, he 
  &quot;tore his garments&quot;, and said: &quot;Great indeed must be the anger 
  of Yahweh blazing out against us because our ancestors did not obey what this 
  book says by practising everything written in it&quot;. Josiah went on to lead 
  a great reform of the religion. </p>
<p>There was, as well, the legend of a lost Temple plan, given by God to Moses 
  and handed down through the rulers. So when the Temple Scroll was found, with 
  its plans for a temple in minute detail and elaborate design, and with its laws 
  and festivals covered nowhere else in the Old Testament, it was of profound 
  interest. The first Temple of Jerusalem was built by Solomon in the 9th century 
  BC, and at that time temple worship centered in Jerusalem became the dominant 
  factor of Jewish spiritual ritual. Solomon's temple was destroyed during the 
  Babylonian captivity in 586 BC but rebuilt by the high priest Zerubbabel in 
  516 BC after the Jews were liberated and returned to Jerusalem. Herod rebuilt 
  this temple in Jesus' day <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(wrong temple, 
  wrong place)</font>, but only a few years after its completion, in 70 AD, it 
  was destroyed by the Romans. At this point temple worship ceased and Judaism 
  found other outlets for spiritual expression. </p>
<p>Measuring 30 feet, the Temple Scroll is the longest scroll of all, and is also 
  called &quot;The Hidden Torah&quot;. The text is of particular interest; it 
  is written in the first person, as though it were the hand of God Himself, giving 
  His law to humanity. Yigael Yadin, Israeli scholar, wrote an insightful and 
  beautifully illustrated book, the Temple Scroll, which visually depicts the 
  layout and construction of the building. In the Temple plan there is a central 
  courtyard housing a temple and various buildings dedicated to the performance 
  of ritual sacrifice. Enclosing these central structures is a square wall, 280 
  cubits to a side. (A cubit is about one-and-a-half feet.) Each side contains 
  a gate opening onto a middle courtyard which is again surrounded by a square 
  wall, 480 cubits to a side. This middle wall has 12 gates, three on each side. 
  The gates represent the 12 tribes of Israel; each is named for a son of Jacob. 
  The middle courtyard gates open onto an outer court that is also surrounded 
  by a wall, 1,600 cubits to a side. It too contains 12 gates. Each gate of the 
  outer court is 70 cubits high and 50 deep. Built into the walls are hundreds 
  of enclosures to house the worshippers who come. The outer wall is three stories 
  high and contains over 800 rooms. The complex is completely surrounded by a 
  moat. </p>
<p>The Temple of Solomon </p>
<p>In esoteric terms, as referenced in the work of Alice Bailey and Helena Blavatsky, 
  the Temple of Solomon symbolizes the causal body or soul. It is built by knowledge 
  and links the physical-plane vehicle with the Monad (the spark of inspiration 
  from the spiritual kingdom.)</p>
<p>The causal body was created in our race at the moment of individualization, 
  when animal man became thinking man. The temple of the causal body, called the 
  &quot;city foursquare&quot;, is built on the Lower Quaternary or four aspects 
  of the personality. These are the physical, astral, mental, and etheric bodies. 
  Here is expressed the &quot;Son&quot; aspect of the Trinity - the &quot;consciousness&quot; 
  that is produced when spirit and matter unite. The temple plan represents the 
  first four initiations.</p>
<p>The outer court is furthest from the temple and therefore the least pure. It 
  represents the first initiation, taken when the disciple transcends the limitations 
  of the physical vehicle. The middle court is the second initiation, taken when 
  the pull of the astral vehicle is overcome. The inner court is the third initiation, 
  taken when the mental vehicle is controlled. </p>
<p>The walls of these courts contain gates named for the sons of Jacob. Each &quot;son&quot; 
  has its correspondence on an astrological sign. The enclosing wall with its 
  12 gates represents a person's progression through the zodiacal signs over the 
  course of many incarnations. The inner court with its four gates may be symbolic 
  of the sacrifice on the &quot;cross of matter.&quot; The central court houses 
  the temple, with its Holy of Holies, the innermost shrine of the Jewish temple, 
  and sacrificial altar. This depicts the 4th initiation, when the causal body 
  or soul, having transcended all experience in the physical world, offers itself 
  for consummation. On the altar of sacrifice, the blood stands for life because 
  it distributes the energy of the soul throughout the physical body. When the 
  blood is spilled the thread of life is severed -- the physical vehicle dies. 
  The Lower Quaternary of the personality -- the temple building -- is then consumed 
  by fire. It becomes the &quot;burnt offering&quot;. This is the unification 
  of the fire of the higher Self with that of the lower, &quot;... the two fires 
  meet, and eventually the egoic body disappears; the fire burns up entirely the 
  Temple of Solomon; the permanent atoms are destroyed, and all is reabsorbed 
  into the Triad. </p>
<p>The essence of the Personality, the faculties developed, the knowledge gained, 
  and the remembrance of all that has transpired becomes part of the equipment 
  of the Spirit and eventually finds its way to the Spirit or Monad on its own 
  plane.&quot; (LOM, p.79) </p>
<p>At this point the initiate can truly echo the words of the Christ: &quot;I, 
  if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto Me.&quot; (Jn.12:32) To the side of 
  the central building the scroll prescribes an edifice called the &quot;House 
  of the Winding Stair&quot;. It contains a spiral staircase opening onto the 
  temple roof and completely overlain with gold. The disciple literally mounts 
  the staircase into the spiritual kingdom, his lower elements transmuted into 
  pure Gold. In just this way does evolution proceed - from creation to destruction 
  to creation again. Each edifice erected serves a purpose for the extent of its 
  life span. Eventually the physical form crumbles and disappears, but its essence 
  is gathered into the Universal Consciousness. All of this is but the beginning 
  groundwork for &quot;... the foundation of the future Temple of Truth where 
  the light of the Lord will be seen and which will prove adequate as an expression 
  of Reality&quot;. (TWM, p.326) </p>
<p>The Eternity of Truth </p>
<p>Throughout the eons of history, truth has followed a wayward path. From unknown 
  depths it surfaces to find an abode in our most brilliant minds. From these 
  few it spreads its embrace for a time, then inevitably finds the resistance 
  that begs its departure. The seers of the ages have long understood this flow. 
  Thus they watch and know when to act, to remove their thoughts and words to 
  silence. Buried and quiescent they stay, a dormant witness, until opportunity 
  opens, another era is born, and humanity awakens - eager once more for the counsels 
  of the spirit.</p>
