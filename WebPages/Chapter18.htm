  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The great Andalusian Sufi, 
    Muhyi 'd-Din Ibn Arabi, used to pray a prayer which begins: 'Enter me, O Lord, 
    into the Deep of the Ocean of Thine Infinite Oneness,' and in the treatises 
    of the Sufis this Ocean is mentioned again and again, likewise by way of symbolic 
    reference to the END towards which their path is directed. Let us therefore 
    begin by saying, on the basis of this symbol, in answer to 'What is Sufism?' 
    From time to time a Revelation 'flows' like a great tidal wave from the Ocean 
    of Infinitude to the shores of our finite world; and Sufism is the vocation 
    and the discipline and the science of plunging into the ebb of one of these 
    waves and being drawn with it to its Eternal and Infinite source.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sufism is a way and a means of 
    striking a root through the Narrow Gate in the depths of the Soul out into 
    the domain of the pure and unimprisonable Spirit which itself opens out on 
    to the Divinity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To follow the Path of the Mystics 
    is to acquire as it were an extra dimension, for this path is nothing other 
    than the dimension of Depth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same compatibility is shown 
    by the symbolism of the Circle with its Centre, its Radii, and its Circumference...If 
    the truth were not Radiant there could be no such thing as a radius, not even 
    a geometric one, let alone a spiritual path which is the highest example...It 
    then proceeds to what might be described as an exploitation of this fact, 
    the Radius being a Ray of Divine Mercy which emanates from the Supreme Center 
    and leads back to it.&quot;</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Conversation With 
    Seyyed Hossein Nasr</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hugh Hewitt: You've written that 
    Sufism as understood in the United States, is sometimes not the traditional 
    understanding of Sufism in the Islamic world. Can you explain that?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seyyed Hossein Nasr: Yes. It's 
    really very unfortunate, because Sufism is the inner dimension of the Islamic 
    revelation. It is not something that is extra, or that is out side of Islam, 
    or which could be practiced seriously without paying attention to, or without 
    practicing the Islam religion itself. But there are many people here in this 
    country who are looking for a rapid way of realizing spiritual truths, or 
    having a spiritual life, and who want to circumvent the usual disciplines 
    that have been connected with a spiritual path. And therefore they try to 
    approach Sufism without any interest in Islam.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hewitt: Are there no shortcuts, 
    then?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nasr: No. There are no shortcuts 
    UNLESS GOD WILLS IT...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In the ongoing conversation Hugh Hewitt asked: &quot;So, different 
  souls have different growth cycles </font>(in other words, different rates of 
  intellectual and emotional maturity)<font size="+1">?&quot; And Nasr replied: 
  &quot;That's right.&quot; &quot;And they have to be respected?&quot; &quot;Oh 
  yes. Definitely. Definetly.&quot;</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hewitt: Let us return to Islam 
    before we get back to Sufism. In the West, and particularly in the United 
    States, the understanding of Islam is often thimble-sized. What are the biggest 
    misunderstandings about Islam that you run into in the United States?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nasr: There are several which, 
    unfortunately, are accentuated--not by accident, but by ill will, which is 
    very, very sad. The first is that Islam is a religion that is spread by the 
    sword, AND THEREFORE THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION OF ISLAM WITH WAR. Now this, 
    of course, is not true. BUT it has a certain element that has to be studied; 
    that is, THE FIRST SPREAD OF ISLAM OUTSIDE OF ARABIA <u>WAS</u> THROUGH THE 
    ARAB ARMIES. Christianity, on the other hand, spread within the Roman Empire 
    and caused a crumbling from within itself, you might say. But once Christianity 
    became the religion of the West, it certainly fought as many wars as Islam 
    or Hinduism or any other religion. And the Crusades were not begun by Muslims; 
    they were begun by the Cluny monks, in France. But nevertheless, the idea 
    that Christianity is the religion of peace and Islam is the religion of war 
    has remained in the minds of many Westerners. </font></p>
  <p>(The point to consider here, and it is essential to understanding the nature 
    of Islam and Christianity, is that the Christian revelation does indeed have 
    its roots in the doctrine of absolute pacifism, and only after apostasizing 
    did it become a religion of war; while Islam began as a religion of the Sword 
    and Muslims must search deep, and look beyond their own literal traditions, 
    to discover the doctrine of strict pacifism that is hidden in the Qur-an. 
    It is only there for those who search for it. So what, we may ask, was God's 
    purpose in all of this? Why was God saying one thing to the early Christians 
    and hiding the same from the early Muslims? What is the nature of the Islamic 
    religion? We only have to look into the world to see it. The Tree is known 
    by its own fruits. It is indeed a terrible thing that God has done with us. 
    When Nasr speaks of Christianity here, he is referring, not to what it was 
    at the beginning or to what it shall return to in the end, but to what the 
    religion became in the third century after it abandoned its own doctrines, 
    and after its unholy marriage to the emperors and kings of the Western world...Ezekiel 
    16; Revelation 17. KJV).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nasr: At one time in its history 
    the West did fear Islam because Islam had taken over the Mediterranean Sea...And 
    so Christianity felt physically threatened. The second time Christianity felt 
    threatened was after the seventeenth century, when the Ottomans took over 
    Eastern Europe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hewitt: Up to the gates of Vienna...</font>(It 
    was here that Like repelled Like)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nasr: Nevertheless, you point out 
    something very important, (when you state that military power is not always 
    the key to expansion). A threat comes not only from military or economic power, 
    but also from spiritual power. Now, the West is innately afraid of the Islamic 
    world--not because, let's say, it feels Egypt is going to send an army to 
    capture Italy. </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(The question 
    of the Middle East notwithstanding)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The West is afraid of something very profound. I don't mean everybody in the 
    West is afraid, because Christianity is still a living element in the West. 
    But secular Western society, which has come to the fore, wants to live in 
    secularism and not be challenged by any power. Separation of church and state 
    in America is only a very minor aspect of this secularism. The fact is that 
    religion has been marginalized in human society; it's for Sunday morning, 
    but the laws on Wall Street have nothing to do with Christ. The few moral 
    laws that remain from the founders of the American Revolution have been challenged 
    during the last decade...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So in the West the sacred has been 
    evicted or destroyed. And into this vacuum might flow the spiritual values 
    of Islam, where the sacred has not been evicted and destroyed...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nasr: I think Islam's role in the 
    world is precisely to uphold the primacy of the sacred. And it will do so 
    until the end of history itself. Islam is not going to follow the same trajectory 
    of the West: from a Christian Middle Ages to a somewhat-less-Christian Renaissance 
    to the Age of Enlightenment to the rise of secularism and finally to evolutionism 
    and twentieth-century out-and-out secularism. This is not going to happen 
    in the Islamic world...What you are going to have in the future is not the 
    West versus the Islamic world, which everybody is talking about today. </font>(Yes, 
    the secularly religious West and the fundamentalists, or literalists of the 
    East will come against each other. One, in fact, is ordained against the other)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    It will really be the secularized West against its own Christian and Jewish 
    elements and the Islamic world. </font>(Yes also, but in such a way as Nasr 
    can not yet realize)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nasr: Islamic eschatology is very 
    similar to the Christian--not in details, but in the grand design As far as 
    micro-eschatology is concerned, Muslims like Christians believe that it's 
    Christ who comes back at the end of history, not the Prophet of Islam. We 
    believe in the same coming of Christ. Many Christians do not know that. In 
    fact, we believe that the descent of Christ upon the Mount of Olives (whose 
    Feet will descend at the place of True Peace) will mark the end of human history. 
    After that, terrestrial reality will be leveled, and everyone will be resurrected 
    and judged by the Supreme Judge...These macro-elements of Islamic eschatology 
    are very similar to the Christian...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hewitt: As we come to the conclusion, 
    I want to ask you about the essay that I found the most interesting for me. 
    It's on spiritual chivalry. What is that?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nasr: This is called 'fatuwa.' 
    It is very difficult to translate, really, but I've translated it as spiritual 
    chivalry. It is an attitude of the soul and character which is giving of itself, 
    is generous, is noble. A soul that is hard with itself, but generous with 
    others. That is willing to forego its own comforts for others. And which acts, 
    sort of, as God's K-n-i-g-h-t. I don't mean night, in that other sense. God's 
    'chevalier,' and therefore the word 'chivalry.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this chivalry is very important 
    to Sufism. It is also very important in Islamic spirituality in general. Ali 
    was the personification of it in Islamic tradition and is, to this day, for 
    both Sunnis and Shi'ites. And perhaps through contact with Islamic sources, 
    the Order of the Knights appeared in the Christian form in the Middle Ages, 
    but without any precedence. Spiritual chivalry has nothing whatsoever to do 
    with the Roman Empire. It is something which the modern world has lost.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;

<p><font size="+1">The Middle Ages have passed, and this age is coming swiftly

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ISMA'ILISM is an extreme branch 
    of the Shi'a. It split off from the main branch after the death of the sixth 
    Imam, Jafar al-Sadiq, over a DISPUTE about the succession </font>(This succession 
    proceeded from Muhammad to Ali, from Ali's sons to the Seventh in line from 
    Ali himself)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. The Isma'ilis are 
    called SEVENERS because they believe Isma'il, Jafar's eldest son, to be his 
    fathers true successor and THE SEVENTH AND LAST IMAM WHO IS NOW IN OCCULTATION 
    (IN HIDING, UNSEEN) BUT WHO WILL ONE DAY RETURN TO EARTH AS THE MADHI (MESSIAH) 
    TO USHER IN A GOLDEN AGE.</font></p>
  <p><i>But in the days of the voice of the Seventh angel, when he shall begin 
    to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as He hath declared to His 
    servants the prophets...</i>(Revelation 10:7).</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Shi'a majority, THE TWELVERS, 
    who are found mainly in Iran, Iraq and Lebanon, accepted Ja'far's second son 
    Musa as the next Imam. He was followed up by five Imams up to the Twelfth 
    who disappeared and who is expected to return as the Madhi on the last day. 
    Another Shi'a group, the Zaydis of northern Yemen, are called FIVERS because 
    they accept only the first four common Imams. Their fifth Imam is Zayd, considered 
    by them to be the Madhi.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isma'ilism was based on four key 
    elements: 1. A secret mystical (esoteric) teaching, which under the outward 
    form of Islam contained a syncretistic mix of metaphysical traditions from 
    many sources. 2. A compact organization as a secret society effectively ruled 
    by a hierarchy. 3. An effective propaganda (missionary) machine. 4. A ruthless 
    political programme. It greatly influenced other extreme Shi'a groups such 
    as the Druze, Alawis, Yezidis and Ali-Ilahis and had a great influence on 
    Sufism and on the Twelver Shi'a doctrine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Isma'ilis integrated into their 
    belief system ideas taken from Jewish and Christian mysticism, Gnosticism, 
    Manichaeism, Neo-Platonism, Hinduism and Buddhiism. They have survived centuries 
    of intensive persecution. They have always been highly organized and loyal 
    to their spiritual leaders and active in propagating their faith to others.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SECRET, ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE - GNOSIS, 
    MA'RIFAH, BATIN</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isma'ili doctrine is founded in 
    the distinction between the literal teaching of the Qur'an and the esoteric 
    (mystical, secret) truth hidden behind it. Every verse in the Qur'an has a 
    literal (Zahir) and a hidden (Batin) meaning. A SPIRITUAL WORLD IS CONCEALED 
    BEHIND EVERY WORD OF SCRIPTURE, WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED BY THOSE WHO ARE 
    TRAINED TO USE THE KEYS OF ALLEGORY, SYMBOLISM AND NUMERICAL COMBINATIONS...The 
    Isma'ili disciple thus gained the emotional satisfaction of discovering the 
    &quot;divine secrets&quot; of the universe. He was also bound by oath and 
    ceremony to the spiritual hierarchy of the sect, headed by the Imam. The secret 
    wisdom which had been transmitted over centuries, was accessible only through 
    the Isma'ili leaders and missionaries who spread the faith and initiated new 
    believers into the sect. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Muhammad was seen merely as the 
    revealer of the literal word and its outward, legalistic, meaning. The Isma'ili 
    Imams were the interpreters of the much more important hidden spiritual truths, 
    and were thus potentially greater than the Prophet himself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ISMA'ILI CONCEPT OF GOD - AIN 
    SOF AND THE TEN SEFIROT</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True worship means Tawhid--declaring 
    the Unity of God. The is includes the negation of all attributes which humans 
    would give to God, the Ultimate One, who is totally different and transcendent. 
    He is the unknowable mystery of mysteries, undefinable, unattainable and incomprehensible. 
    God as the &quot;supreme void&quot; is beyond concept, beyond existence and 
    beyond good and evil.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since God is beyond human comprehension, 
    there must be intermediaries between him and our material world. This was 
    solved by placing a whole hierarchy of emanations (lesser Gods who separated 
    from the same divine essence) between the One Ultimate One and our world. 
    The first emanation from the Divine Essence was the Divine Will, also called 
    the First Intellect or the Universal Mind (The Word). From the Universal Mind 
    emanated the Universal Soul which in turn created the next emanation AND SO 
    ON DOWN TO THE TENTH...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The process of creation was thus 
    accompanied by a cosmic struggle and fall in which fragments of divine light 
    were trapped in the matter of this world...Isma'ilism also accepts the existence 
    of a whole hierarchy of angels and other spiritual beings. An important teaching 
    is that all the emanations and some of the spiritual hierarchy are always 
    manifested in </font>(human form)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    throughout the ages </font>(Romans 8:38; Colossians 1:16)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SEVEN CYCLES</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isma'ilis viewed history as a succession 
    of Seven Cycles of Revelation...The sixth cycle is the age of Islam in which 
    the Speaker Prophet, Muhammad, appeared to begin the cycle...The Seven Speakers 
    were Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad...But when the Seventh appears, 
    he will abrogate organized religion all together. He will abrogate their laws 
    and will institute a new era with a universal religion. </font>www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/mgcismai.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> ...They may leap out of the past into the future. Muslims 
  must make that leap. It is obvious in the purely kabbalistic doctrines of the 
  Isma'ilis that Islam has already anticipated it. And in the process they must 
  also offer a true atonement for themselves (actually others will make it for 
  them). They must experience their own form of <i>Glasnost</i> (if we may use 
  the word), and awaken, first to the realization that despite what many Islamicists 
  believe and teach, there is much that God hid from the worldly eyes of Islam 
  itself, and then to those realities themselves. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">One young woman in a recent documentary on Islam, speaking 
  to her very loving and tolerant father, said to him in her own deeply respectful 
  way, that there were many aspects of Islam that <i>we Muslims</i> do not want 
  to come to grips with <i>realities</i> that we do not want to face about our 
  own religion. This reluctance, of course, results...from zeal to be sure, but 
  also from a lack of <i>real</i> substantive faith. A lack of submission? no, 
  but lack of faith? yes. It comes from an undeveloped and unperfected imagination. 
  It comes in the historical sense from a collective lack of personal experience--a 
  Western experience. (No Magdalines need apply). This happens when individuals--great 
  masses of them to be exact--are still unconsciously and immaturely unsure of 
  the meanings of their own religion (ignorant of its complexities and of the 
  <i>process </i>of human perfection itself), and when these try to expiate those 
  uncertainties by insisting that there are no shortcomings or discrepencies, 
  nor even anomalies in their own system of beliefs whatsoever--that there is 
  no <i>Mystery</i> of Islam. And then such ideas are institutionalized when certain 
  powerful individuals arise who not only attempt to enforce the dictates of such 
  beliefs upon themselves, but upon others as well (shades of old St. Augustine), 
  as if the truth itself had not the power to do so on its own. God has exploited 
  these aspects of the Islamic mind in a great historic way. In fact the exploitation 
  is built into the fabric the Holy Qur'an itself. It was all very intentional. 
  How else could God judge the world? How else could God have finally created 
  <i>Man</i> in Their own Universal image? possessing, as God does, a full understanding 
  of the nature of both Light and Darkness, of the only ways in which the world 
  could learn the difference, and the only ways in which Their own sons and daughters 
  could ultimately learn to see these things in themselves? After all, could not 
  God have the entire human race falling down on its knees five times a day in 
  absolute submission to Divine Will? </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Nasr says that Ali was the personification of the perfect spirit 
  of chivalry in Islam. This may have been so for the time, but the Darkness is 
  passing and I personally would not want to be subject to any of the present-day 
  followers of Ali, to the mullahs and the <i>scholars</i> of Iran or Iraq, nor 
  to the <i>Sunnah</i> of the other Middle Eastern nations. <i>For where the Spirit 
  of the Lord is, there is liberty</i>. The sainted Ali was an Islamic warrior, 
  a slayer of other men in the name of Allah, a contender for power and authority, 
  and Nasr sees no anomaly in this. Of course there is none (so long as our conversation 
  is confined to the past, and even to the present, for Islam is still performing 
  the perfect will of Allah). It is, indeed, a terrible thing that God has done 
  with men. And when we reason that Ali was motivated in all of these things by 
  the teachings of Islam, then we must reason that it is a terrible thing that 
  God has done with men throught the precepts of the Holy Qur'an.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a work entitled <i>The 
  Holy Grail</i>, Norma Lorre Goodrich explores this phenomenon--the knight's 
  quest for <i>purity of thought</i>,<i> excellence of spirit</i>, as well as 
  <i>mastery of the ways of sacred warfare</i>--among Christians in Europe. We 
  reason, however, that the impetus toward knighthood stirred the spiritual imagination 
  much earlier than Seyyed Hossein Nasr might allow, as the oral traditions concerning 
  <i>The Fellowship of the Mystery </i>(and its relationship to the hidden Feminine 
  principle) and the epic confrontation that would unfold at last between the 
  forces of Light and the forces of Darkness in the world, began to slowly filter 
  throughout that ancient world after the time of Christ. (Please consider Ephesians 
  3:9; Eph. 6:10-17 and 2 Corinthians 10:1-6 in this light, and begin to compare 
  these precepts with what we are learning of the oral traditions of the Torah 
  and the Book of Joshua, and then with the texts entitled <i>The Triumph Of God, 
  Descriptions of the Final Age; The War Of The Sons of Light And The Sons Of 
  Darkness; The Route of Belial</i> and <i>Weal And Woe: An Exhortation </i>in 
  Theodor Gaster's edition of <i>The Dead Sea Scriptures</i>, or in any comparable 
  edition of these texts)<i>. </i>The whole of it will provide our basis of understanding, 
  and our means of comparing as well as contrasting Christianity in the West and 
  Islam in the East, and for discovering the spirit of Light and the spirit of 
  Darkness that drives and energizes both. We will not, however, simply compare 
  and contrast them, but we will see how both Christianity and Islam--not in their 
  separate literal traditions which constantly divide them, or in the literal 
  tenor of the Qur'an which has been given not only to enflame the spirit of Darkness 
  in Islam but to ultimately facilitate the judgment of God upon Islam itself, 
  but in their common esoteric tradition--are one and the same. To be a true Christian 
  is to be a true Muslim, and to be either one is to be a true Jew.</font></p>

  and every subsequent communication between the prophet and the Higher World 
  will be colored, or marred, or even brought to perfection as it is, by the spiritual 
  perfections, but also by the spiritual imperfections of the prophet himself, 
  or rather of those who memorized and recorded the words). Many orthodox Muslims,

  interpretations of these things, will not entertain the criticisms that attend 
  this period of Islamic history (and many in the Muslim world have payed dearly, 
  even with their lives, for doing so). Many of these insist that Islam has no 
  imperfections and that Muhammad was fully cognizent of the meanings of the revelations 
  he was channeling from above (and also borrowing from the other religious traditions 
  as some say), and that Islam as a religion is set squarely on a foundation of 
  Spiritual Knowledge and a full Understanding of Things Divine. It is true: The

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seyyed Hossein Nasr: &quot;The 
    Koran is a central, sacred reality of Islam. It is for Muslims, the verbatim 
    word of God and it corresponds to Christ. It is sacred in the same way that 
    Christ in Christianity is sacred. Everything about Him is sacred--His body, 
    even His robe, His voice, His word, and His Spirit. In that way everything 
    about the Koran is sacred for Muslims. There is the physical Koran that they 
    carry. The calligraphy which writes the word. Of course the sonorous aspect 
    is significant--the chanting of the Koran--because the Koran was first revealed 
    through sound. The Prophet heard it. And then, of course, the content and 
    the ideas and the teachings...&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">...even if Islam does 
  not. Muhammad's, however, as the world can presently and clearly attest, was 
  a Night Vision. What he understood, he understood. What he did not understand, 
  he did not understand. And we must reason that he was chosen by the Spirit for 
  his role in history, and as a conveyer of the words of the Sacred Qur'an, precisely 
  for this reason: because of his extraordinary receptivity and obedience to the 
  word, but also because of his very earthly and human inclinations that caused 
  and allowed him to go back and forth across the line that separated the Higher 
  and Lower worlds. Muhammad was indeed a prophet, but of a very natural sort. 
  Like the whole of Judaiasm and Christianity before him, he was a perfect vessel, 
  a bearer in his own person of the sublime elements of Darkness and the unseen 
  elements of Pure Light. Remember: <i>Allah has a plan, </i>and Islam had a mission:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his 
    horns are like the Horns of Unicorns </font></i>(a symbol of Allah--One)<font size="+1"><i>:

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Among those things hidden 
  from the imperfect state of mind, in addition to the meaning of the Grail itself, 
  is the realization that the Grail has been in the custody of the Divine Mother 
  (Holy Wisdom Herself) all these centuries, and the Feminine Principle of Reality 
  that attends Her. Thus the Grail knight's particular idealization and service 
  to the divine, the magic, the beauty, and the power of womankind (Femalekind). 
  He seeks not to suppress her, however, or to rule over her, but to find Her 
  and to liberate her from her captors. (And in our times this means from the 
  fundamentalists and literalists who do not know the difference between the Female 
  gender and the term <i>Woman</i> as it is used by Wisdom Herself everywhere 
  throughout the sacred Scriptures.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Actually the Companions 
  fell directly into the little trap that Wisdom Herself had set. Having transcribed 
  the words of the Holy Qur'an as they were channeled from the mouth of the Prophet, 
  or as they later remembered them, they then enacted and followed these words 
  after the dictates of their own purely Bedouine-masculine hearts, without giving 
  a great deal of thought to the meaning of the words themselves, and all of this 
  to the ruin of many. Many true Muslims, along with many &quot;non-religious&quot; 
  over the centuries who have tried to transcend such literal meanings and to 
  release the Divine Feminine from her lower status, and from her house of prison, 
  have payed dearly for their attempts. (Please see chapter 5). Without Her, however, 
  the true knight is helpless, he has virtually no <i>raison d'etre. </i>Without 
  him, of course, she is helpless. There is no balance, and no final liberation. 
  The two are intricately and tantrically (and might we add, erotically) bound 
  to each other, and are much more than equal to each other in the mysteries of 
  the Tree of Life. She who guards and protects is priestess (or Queen). He who 
  gains entrance is priest (or King). Together they are Urim and Thummim--Lights 
  and Perfection.</font></p>

  A True Story of Life Behind the Veil in Saudi Arabia</i>, by Jean Sasson:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;So it was that in 1901, twenty-five year old Abdul Aziz returned 
    to out land...and soundly defeated his enemies, the Rasheeds. In the years 
    to follow, to ensure the loyalty of the desert tribes, Abdul Aziz married 
    more than three hundred women, who in time produced more than fifty sons and 
    eighty daughters. The sons of his favorite wives held the honour of favored 
    status. These sons, now grown, are at the very center of power in our land. 
    <font size="2">(p.18)</font>.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;My father (one of these sons) was a merciless man; as a predicted 
    result, my mother was a melancholy woman. Their tragic union eventually produced 
    eighteen children of whom eleven survived...Today, the ten females live their 
    lives controlled by the men to whom they are married. Their only surviving 
    son, a prominent Saudi prince and business man, with four wives and many mistresses, 
    leads a life of great promise and pleasure. <font size="2">(p.19)</font>.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The men of the country feel they are what they have had to become. 
    In Saudi Arabia, the pride of man's honour evolves from his women, so he must 
    enforce his authority and supervise over the sexuality of his women or face 
    public disgrace.</b></p>
  <p><b>Convinced that women have no control over their own sexual desires, it 
    then becomes essential that the dominant male carefully guard the sexuality 
    of his female. This absolute control over the female has nothing to do with 
    love, only with fear of the male's tarnished honour.</b></p>
  <p><b>The authority of the Saudi male is unlimited: his wife and children survive 
    only if he desires. In our homes he is the state. This complex situation begins 
    with the rearing of our young boys. From an early age, the male child is taught 
    that women are of little value. They exist only for his comfort and convenience. 
    The child witnesses the disdain shown his mother and sisters by his father; 
    this open contempt leads to his scorn of all females, and makes it impossible 
    for him to enjoy friendship with anyone of the opposite sex. Taught only the 
    role of master to slave, it is little wonder that by the time he is old enough 
    to take a mate, he considers her chattel, not his partner. <font size="2">(p.22)</font>.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The history of our women is buried beneath the black veil of secresy...We 
    yearn for our personal freedom. <font size="2">(p.23)</font>.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Sara (Sultana's sister, a young woman forced without her consent 
    to marry a sixty-two year old man), in Father's view, was doing what women 
    were born to do, serve and pleasure the male, and produce his children...</b></p>
  <p><b>I wept with the fury of one who questions the wisdom of a God who allows 
    evil to conquer the innocent...Sara's new husband was sadistic. He had subjected 
    my sister to sickening sexual brutality until she felt her only escape was 
    death.</b></p>
  <p><b>Father stood, unblinking. He probably realized that in all likelihood, 
    Sara would be forced by the men of religion to return to her husband <font size="2">(after 
    her suicide attempt)</font>. If the past were any precedent, they would advise 
    the husband to deal with his wife in the manner spelled out in the Koran. 
    And then they would turn their backs <font size="2">(on Sara's despicable 
    situation)</font>...Had Sara been forced to file for separation, many difficulties 
    would have arisen. For the religious authorities might have ruled: <i>You 
    might dislike a thing which Allah has meant for your own good</i>. <font size="2">(p.58)</font>.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;In Father's mind Sara had obviously provoked her husband into criminal 
    behavior. It is never the fault of the man in the Middle East. Even if he 
    murders his wife, the man will state &quot;valid&quot; reasons for his actions, 
    which will be accepted by other men without question. In my country I have 
    seen articles that honour a man for executing his wife or daughter for the 
    crime of &quot;indecent behavior.&quot; The mere suspicion of sexual misconduct, 
    such as kissing, can bring death to a young girl. In addition public congratulations 
    are given from the men of religion for the father's &quot;notable&quot; act 
    of upholding the commands of the Prophet. <font size="2">(pp.61,62)</font>. 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;To those who would listen, Hadi (the religious friend of Sultana's 
    brother, Ali), loudly exclaimed his viewpoint that all women should be confined 
    to the home; and that women were the cause of evil on earth...<font size="2">(On 
    a visit to Cairo, however):</font> He devoured the dancers with his eyes, 
    and made crude remarks about their body parts, yet he swore to Ali that they 
    were nothing but whores, and that if he had his way, they would be stoned...</b></p>
  <p><b><font size="2">(That night in the hotel):</font> The door was unlocked...and 
    we suddenly realized what was happening before our eyes. Hadi was raping a 
    young girl, no more than eight years old, and Ali was holding her. Blood was 
    everywhere. The two were laughing...</b></p>
  <p><b><font size="2">(In Rome):</font> Hadi and Ali spent their time buying 
    women...I saw Ali as I always had, a selfish young man, concerned only with 
    his own pleasure. But Hadi, I knew was far more evil, for he bought the women 
    yet condemned them for their role in the act. He desired them, yet hated them 
    and the system that left them free to do as they would. His hypocrisy was 
    to me the essence of the evil nature of men. <font size="2">(p.80)</font>...</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Within a month (of my Mother's death) we learned from Ali that Father 
    was preparing to wed again, for four wives were common among the Bedouin men...Father's 
    new bride was fifteen. <font size="2">(p.86)</font>...</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Father seemed pleased with his new possession...Ali cracked jokes 
    about Father's sexual prowess. I asked my brother what he thought about the 
    young girl's feelings in the matter--to be wed to one so much older, one she 
    did not know or love? Ali's vacant expression told me all too clearly not 
    only that the thought had never entered his head but that such a consideration 
    would not find fertile ground in his narrow realm of understanding. He well 
    reminded me that nothing would ever penetrate that dark sea of egotistical 
    matter that constitutes the mind of a Saudi man.&quot; <font size="2">(pp.89.90)</font>.</b></p>

  became their &quot;church,&quot; &quot;Eve.&quot; And as we know, this &quot;woman,&quot;

  men in particular, but that is not true; the West had its Chrysostoms, its Ambroses 
  and Augustines before Islam had its Companions), that caused and allowed them 
  to misinterpret the Scriptures and the spoken words of the Oracles that were 
  handed on to them, thus institutionalizing into the religious system itself 
  what everyone else outside that system clearly sees as massive injustices, oppressions 
  and crimes against womankind (that is, against Female-kind). But this has been 
  the work of Divine Wisdom Herself, so that the evil in men's hearts could be 
  manifest. And despite the very present fact that the oppressors themselves seem 
  to be in charge of the Qur'an, and of all the interpretations and enactments 
  that flow from it, <i>Fiqh </i>and <i>Sharia</i>, the Qur'an knows what they 
  do not. There is that part of Allah that does not act without the loving approval 
  of His own Beloved. (They are ONE). But She is appearing in the West now, just 
  as She appeared in the East two thousand years ago. She has the very idea of 
  the inferiority of the female firmly under Her feet. (Revelation 12:1...KJV).

  is of preserving the traditional and archaic dictates of the past, and the authority 
  of the male gender over the female, without any higher understanding of what 
  these things mean), is a judgment against those who make the enactments and 
  pass down the judgments. For they, proving they can not interpret Sacred Writ, 
  and unable to discern the difference between the Female gender and the term

  are referring to (the ones from which we are commanded to abstain...Revelation 
  14:4 for instance), and still deeply in need of coition themselves in every 
  matter of Things Divine. Of course the Prophet, it might be reasoned, is innocent

  the Book of Joshua, and therefore the Mystery of Christ, has been expressed 
  in military terms and metaphors it has (intentionally) given rise to two orders 
  of warriors in the world, those who take those words literally, and who fight 
  in the ways of the lower, fallen world (and quite religiously so), and those 
  who take those words metaphorically, and who fight in the ways of the Spirit. 
  Both are ordained by God, and therein lies the mystique of Islam. Like Judaism 
  and Christianity before it, there are two pathways running directly through 
  the mind of Islam, both of them originating in the Garden of Eden when the spirits 
  of both Cain and Abel appeared in the earth. Only one of them, however, can 
  inherit the age to come and the world to come, as it is also written: <i>Cast 
  out the bondwoman and her son...</i>(Galatians 4:21-31; Genesis 21:1-10). Both 
  Cain and Abel (Ishmael and Isaac, along with Esau and Jacob), were cut out of 
  the same piece of allegorical fabric. Each is a set in the same long sequence 
  of archetypes found in the Scriptures--brothers, one Dark, one Light--representing 
  not only the mixture of Darkness and Light that dwells in the heart and soul 
  of every single individual, but the actual division that finally exists everywhere 
  throughout the Adamic world between the children of Darkness and the children 
  of Light in our time. Each has followed the (pre-ordained) path that is strongest 
  in them:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons 
    of Adam. Behold, they each represented a sacrifice to God. It was accepted 
    from one but not the other. Said the latter: Be sure we will slay thee. Surely, 
    said the former, God doth accept the sacrifice of those who are righteous.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">If thou dost stretch forth thy hand against me, to slay 
    me, it is not for me to stretch forth my hand against thee: For I do fear 
    God, the Cherisher of the worlds.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well 
    as thine...</font></i><font size="+1">(Sura 5.30-31).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Of course this text literally 
  abrogates any other command, or direction the Muslim soul believes it has received 
  in matters of human warfare and self defense, and the taking of human life; 
  for the entire epic, the entire story of the struggle between the children of 
  Light and the children of Darkness in the world, begins in the story of Cain 
  and Abel. If the self-professing child of Adam--whether they be Hindu or Jew, 
  Christian or Muslim--behaves in the ways of Cain (a taker of human life--even 
  though there is permission in the sacred texts to do so), and not in the ways 
  of Abel, it is because God (having also given men commandments appropriate to 
  their own violent natures) for His own creative purposes has willed it:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised 
    my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths</font></i><font size="+1"> </font>(my 
    higher meanings)<font size="+1"><i>, and their eyes were after their father's 
    idols </i></font>(their father's ways)<font size="+1"><i>.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, 
    and judgments whereby they should not live;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused 
    to pass through the Fire </font></i>(of human warfare)<font size="+1"><i> 
    all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that 
    they might know that I am the Lord...</i>(Ezekiel 20:24-26).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Among the commandments 
  that God gave Islam which are not good (good for the world in the most paradoxical 
  and ironic ways, but not for the individuals who are so led), is permission 
  to wage human warfare, to fight in the Lesser Holy Wars against other nations 
  and other armies (as opposed to the Greater Holy Wars that are fought only, 
  and purely against the Self). But how else could God judge the world? And again, 
  the Prophet was only, and most &quot;obediently,&quot; channeling the words 
  of the angel of the East, Gabriel, as he was receiving them. How did he receive 
  them:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next question is about the 
    nature of the revelation itself. When Harith, the son of Hisham, once inquired 
    of the Prophet how revelation came to him, he replied: &quot;It comes to me 
    sometimes as the ringing of a bell and this is hardest on me, then he (the 
    angel) leaves me and I remember from him what he says; and sometimes the angel 
    comes in the shape of a man and he talks to me and I remember what he says.&quot; 
    (Bu.1.1). These are the only two forms in which the Quranic revelation came 
    to the Prophet. In both cases, the angel came to him and was seen by him; 
    in both cases a certain message was delivered in words which he at once committed 
    to memory...The only difference between the two cases was that in one case 
    the angel appeared in the shape of a human being and uttered the words in 
    a soft tone as a man talks to another; in the other case, it is not stated 
    in what form he came, but we are told that the words were uttered like the 
    ringing of a bell, that is to say, in a harsh, hard tone, which made it a 
    heavier task for the Prophet to receive them....In both cases the Prophet 
    was transported, as it were, to another world, and this transportation caused 
    him to go through a severe experience...which was harder still when the message 
    did not appear in human shape. </font>The Religion of Islam, by Maulana Muhammad 
    Ali, p.21<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the same time the Prophet 
  was yielding to the conditions that were unfolding around him. These included, 
  of course, the internal conditions of his own heart, but also the rising and 
  overwhelming clamor for divine vengeance that was ringing from the hearts of 
  those who followed him:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For individual Muslims, abandoning 
    Mecca and people, city and family, in the 'Hijrah'</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">meant 
    a crisis of personal independence. Those who threw in their lot with Muhammad 
    were crossing their own Rubicon as well as his. Emigration meant an end to 
    ambiguity of allegiance...In the definitive first year of the 'Hijrah', Muslim-Quraishi 
    tensions opened into military conflict...Medina was never merely a refuge, 
    but always in intention a base and a structure of power. Adherence, on either 
    side, sharpened, therefore into a political and military either/or. Muslims 
    graduated, so to speak, by the 'Hijrah,' from a group into an army, from a 
    community of faith to an order of authority. A long and patient endurance 
    of minority status was transformed into...political determination...Establishment 
    in the new city could only ensue on such a basis. The 'Hijrah' was thus, in 
    concept and by prelude, a decision for active military measures against Quraishi 
    recalcitrance and, in that form, a definitive conclusion to a long and strenuous 
    'open question' of prophetic vocation... The migration was an end of passive 
    suffering and enduring patience </font>(please compare Matthew 24:5-13):<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

    comes from God. Before things came into existence He determined the plan of 
    them; and they fill their appointed roles. It is in accordance with His glorious 
    design that they discharge their functions. Nothing can be changed. In His 
    hand lies the government of all things. God it is that sustains them in their 
    needs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, this God created man to rule 
    the world, and appointed for him Two Spirits after whose direction he was

    All who practice righteousness are under the dominion of the prince of Lights, 
    and walk in the ways of Light; whereas all who practice perversity are under 
    the dominion of the Angel of Darkness. Through the Angel of Darkness, however, 
    even those who practice righteousness are made liable to error. All their 
    sins and iniquities, all their guilt and their deeds of transgression are 
    the result of his dominion. And this, by God's inscrutible design, will continue 
    until the time appointed by Him. Moreover, all men's afflictions and all their 
    moments of tribulation are due to this being's malevolent sway. All the spirits 
    that attend upon him are bent on causing the children of Light to stumble. 
    Howbeit, the God of Israel and the Angel of His Truth are always there to 
    help them.</font></p>

    compassion, of perpetual goodness, of insight, of perception, of that sense 
    of the Divine Power that is based at once on an apprehension of God's works, 
    and a reliance on His plentious Mercy, of a spirit of knowledge informing

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Islam was God's means

  though God, in this sense, raised up Islam in the East as a mirror image of 
  Christianity in the West (which is why these two religions are presently at 
  war with each other), the religion of Islam was also God's means of securing 
  these blessing for all who walk in the pathways of Light, and in the statutes

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">All of these things have

  Revelation might be completed, that it might come to its conclusion and that 
  it might begin again on the next higher plane of human consciousness. All of 
  these things have been instituted in the interest of continuity, so that the 
  beginning of the creation process did not get disconnected from its effects, 
  so that the mind of Light (Life) might be manifest and at last delivered from 
  the mind of Darkness (Death) in the last day. (Genesis 1:14-18). But principally, 
  so that God (Him and Herself, in consort with Creation itself), might be revealed 
  in the Whole. (For that is the whole duty of each soul born into the Light, 
  to know God). They are not only ONE with each other (we cannot comprehend the 
  ONE without also comprehending TWO), but together They are both the Destroyers 
  of worlds and the Creator of worlds. AllaH destroys, in the very interest of 
  Creation Herself. The Lord brings to oblivion all that is unjust and grown out 
  of balance--thus everything that is not conformed to Their own Image in the 
  Universe. They had, of course, to let every thing come to fruition as it has, 
  the Darkness out of which Light emerges (the chaos out of which order emerges), 
  for very essential cosmic and psychological reasons, while, in Their Wisdom 
  and Mercy, providing every means of deliverance from the destructions themselves. 
  These means are awakening, repentance, and transformation. </font></p>

  man has made.&quot; &quot;As the person matures,&quot; he says, &quot;our sense 
  of the <i>wholly other</i> matures&quot;...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For Freud religion was an

    grasp reality ever more fully we regard as teleological. Religious experience 
    thus bears witness to a person's ability to see ever more fully reality as 
    it reveals itself.&quot; (pp.7, 8).</font> </p>

  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;My God, my God, Why hast 
    thou forsaken me.&quot; Here his human nature attains divinity: at that moment 
    God experiences what it is like to be a mortal man and drinks to the dregs 
    what he made his faithful servant Job to suffer. Here is given the answer 
    to Job, and clearly this sublime moment is as divine as it is human, as 'eschatological' 
    as it is 'psychological.' And at this moment too, where one can feel the human 
    being so absolutely, the divine myth is present in full force.&quot; (p.46).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We can take it for certain 
    that the author of the Epistles of John made every effort to practice what 
    he preached to his fellow Christians. For this purpose he had to shut out 
    all negative feelings, and, thanks to a helpful lack of self-reflection, he 
    was able to forget them. But though they disappeared from the conscious level 
    they continued to rankle beneath the surface, and in the course of time spun 
    an elaborate web of resentments and vengeful thoughts which then burst upon 
    consciousness in the form of a revelation. From this there grew up a terrifying 
    picture that blatantly contradicts all ideas of Christian humility, tolerance, 
    love of your neighbor and your enemies, and makes nonsense of a loving father 
    in heaven and rescuer of mankind. A veritable orgy of hatred, wrath, vindictiveness, 
    and blind destructive fury that revels in fantastic images of terror breaks 
    out, and with blood and fire overwhelms a world which Christ had just endeavored 
    to restore to the original state of innocence and loving communion with God.

  very depths and heights of Divine Consciousness but into the depths and heights 
  of our human minds. God could have left us in the natural state, as innocent 
  members of the animal kingdom, but then there would be no reason for Creation 
  in the first place. We must forgive God, just as we must forgive our own parents 
  for being who they were. We must see the Lotus of Human Creation unfolding.

  under foot</i> all these centuries. (Revelation 11:2). Thus as history would 
  have it, Christianity and Islam were eventually made to meet each other right 
  there at the center of the mystery, <a href="../UsedImages/pg357.gif">at the 
  Gates of Vienna.</a> Not only did they repel one another there but they layed 
  the structure between them, and the political framework for those conditions

  JULY 14 - SEPTEMBER 11, 1683</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ever since Constantinople fell 
    to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 they became the relentless terror of Christendom. 
    For centuries the nations of Europe fought the Turks on land and at sea. There 
    were great battles and victories and temporary peace treaties...The struggle 
    between Islam and Christendom continued and the initiative remained with the 
    Turks so that, by 1683, they controlled most of Hungary with only the upper 
    portion remaining part of the Holy Roman Empire, synonymous with the House 
    of Hapsburg and Austria...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sultan Mehmed (in an attempt to 
    secure his stronghold against the Hapsburg emperor, Leopold I), sent his Grand 
    Vizier, the swarthy Kara Mustafa, to aid his Hungarian subjects. Mustafa marched 
    straight for Vienna...From the towers of St. Stephens, the people beheld a 
    sea of thousands of multicolored Turkish tents drawn up in crescent moon formation 
    southwest of the city. They included Mustafa's opulent pavilion with his hundreds 
    of concubines and slaves and exotic animals...If Vienna's walls could not 
    hold till help arrived, its streets would run red with Christian blood...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reinforcements came...And the 
    attack opened with a terrific barrage of musketry, demoralizing and thinning 
    the Turkish defense...With the cry of &quot;Jezus Maria ratuj&quot; (Jesus 
    Maria help) the whole Polish line rode down upon the Turks. Encased in glittering 
    steel that covered head to thighs, with their tiger and leopard pelts fluttering 
    in the wind and eagles' wings affixed to their backs, the leading units of 
    hussars presented an almost unearthly spectacle...At around 10 PM, the battle 
    came to an end. In the Turkish camp, Christian infants and children cringed 
    among hundreds of butchered captives. Starhemberg's garrison took revenge 
    by burning 3,000 abandoned Ottoman sick and wounded alive...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the allied victory had strained, 
    rather than cemented, the ties between the Holy Roman Empire and Poland, the 
    rest of Christendom celebrated. In the streets of Vienna and in the cities 
    of Austria and all throughout Europe there was a feeling of euphoria...A Turkish 
    victory would not have meant the end of free Christendom, because France would 
    have presented a bulwark to further Ottoman expansion. However, Austria was 
    saved and, more importantly, the initiative passed to the Holy Roman Empire. 
    After hundreds of years of warfare the Christians had turned the tide against 
    the Sword of Islam. </font>Military Heritage, October, 2002<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Thus, we have already seen...that 
    Lancelot was not so much a military hero as he was a religious hero. For that

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus Lancelot and Perceval, who 
    thus far we assume are our premier Grail heroes and Grail Initiates, emerge 
    from their trappings only momentarily... White doves, chalices, white samite, 
    candles, and broken swords await their entrance into Grail Castles. These 
    Grail heroes have now led us inescapably to the Crusades, during which our 
    Grail texts were written, and in fear and trembling on our part, to the most 
    awful massacres of the Middle Ages. (The mass destruction of Muslims in the 
    East and of 'heritics' in Europe).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christianity, observed Sismondi, 
    suffered a severe loss. It became...a military religion....</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="+1">Every serious student 
  of history knows that the loss occurred when (the dark side of) Christianity 
  joined itself to the emperor and empire in the time of Constantine (during the 
  time when the legends of the Grail and the Round Table were still in their formative 
  stages). The gates (the lower limbs) of Christianity were thrown wide open to 
  the world, and every wordling, prince and prelate alike, came into her. (Please 
  read <i>How Christians Made Peace With War</i>, by John Driver). Those who would 
  not come into her were forced to. By now, however, the true mystics of the Church 
  had all gone underground, <i>Buried and hid with Christ</i> as it was. </font></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Christian virtues most sought 
    </font>(after that)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> were bravery, 
    constancy and prowess. Christian knights were encouraged to make larger and 
    larger blood sacrifices of Muslims called 'infidels' and 'unbelievers'....</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Please see now that Christianity 
  and Islam had each become a reflection of the other, and a judgment on the other 
  (as they still are today). What each saw in the other, the Mind of Light could 
  see in both.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">These descriptions should 
  be providing everyone with a window through which they may see into their own 
  souls. The powers of Darkness, church and state together (of which the powers 
  of Islam were a direct reflection), were abroad in the land, wreaking havoc 
  and vengeance, and counter-vengeance, in the Name of God--just as they are today. 
  Anyone who follows these institutions and their leaders (or even worse, their 
  very own heart) into battle, or consents to their excitations, and their executions, 
  or anyone who willingly gives their sons and daughters to them, be they Christian, 
  Jew or Muslim, is in the grip of Darkness. And it is this realm of Darkness 
  itself, this massive state of ignorance of things Divine, that The Lord of All 
  Things is preparing to rise up and destroy. God accomplishes it by bringing 
  the Darkness together against itself. (It has already begun in the Middle East). 
  In the midst of all this historic carnage, however, the blood of the Righteous 
  was being continuously spilled out upon the earth, fertilizing the soil (the 
  soul, that is, of humankind), bringing us to our present state of affairs in 
  the world, and to the meaning of the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i></i></font><i><font size="+1">And Moses took the blood, 
    and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant 
    which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words...</font></i><font size="+1">(Exodus 
    24:8).</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For the Life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have 
    given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it 
    is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul...</font></i><font size="+1">(Leviticus 
    17:8-14).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Though their own lives 
  may be required of them the children of Light are not permitted to shed the 
  blood of others in the earth, no, not for any single reason whatsoever. The 
  Holy Qur'an, like the Law and the Prophets, is very clear about it. (It is clear 
  to the mind of Light that is). There is, however, as we have already discovered 
  in the previous chapters, an order of spiritual warriors in the earth, an angelic 
  order, that IS called to execute the judgments of God in the earth. These powers 
  (the powers of the Supernal order...look into the East and understand Romans 
  13), fierce and terrible as they are, have a direct commandment from above to 
  assist the children of Light, and to liberate them in their darkest hour, as 
  it was written long ago: <i>And to divide the Light from the Darkness</i>. (Genesis 
  1:18). They are sent forth from <a href="../UsedImages/pg178print.gif">the Right 
  Hand</a> of the Lord, not only to <i> minister for them who shall be heirs of

    Two Horns in the Book of Daniel (8:3). But in the same book, the Ram with 
    Two Horns was smitten, cast to the ground, and stamped upon by the He-goat

  philosophy (one that transcends Democracy altogether). It is a violent and self-destructive 
  image at that, for it gives space to man's most craven instincts and aspirations 
  (modern economic theory), and allows the most violent of men to ascend among 
  the people, so long, of course, as they clothe themselves in the garments of 
  religious worship and proper civil discourse. True religion (and the economic 
  and political frame of mind that flows from it) transcends the modern notion 
  of democracy because its roots are nurtured in the emotional wellsprings of 
  love, cosmic love, and in such a sense of connectedness to all things that it 
  is by nature the direct antithesis of material self-interest and social competativeness. 
  It exists to reflect the magnitude of the Divine Presence to an evolving human

  oppressive exercise of self-will. (1 Corinthians 13:4-10). The Democracies, 
  on the other hand, must remain ever vigilant, and always on either the defense 
  or offense against God. And this because, using their &quot;liberty&quot; as

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">...And the tract between 
  the two is Europe. The Gog-Magog people are the ancient Scythian alliance who 
  attacked Europe in the 6th century B.C., and finally the Western alliance (with 
  America as their head) that attacked it again according to all the words of 
  the prophets in the 20th century... If one were to travel up the Danube, into 
  Central Europe, they would have to pass through a narrow gorge in the river 
  that separates Rumania from the former Yugoslavia called the Iron Gate--but 
  this passage only brings us closer to the meaning of the Iron Barrier. Where 
  the Book of Daniel mentions the Four empires that succeeded each other, starting 
  with the Babylonian, the Medio-Persian, the Grecian, and the Roman, it likens 
  them to the Four metals, gold, silver, brass, and iron. (Daniel 2:31-40). Thus 
  iron (which is the core element of the planet Earth itself, and therefore another 
  symbol of that place named Tifereth in the center of the Tree of Life) is associated 
  with the Roman empire, whose boundries extended to the Center of Europe in the 
  time of Christ, and to that obscure and forsaken city (the City of David) that 
  lay hidden at the center of the World Mystery, near the Gates of Vienna. It 
  is the land wherein Moses not only said that Israel may <i>dig iron</i> (Deut.8:9), 
  but against which the prophet was also directed: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thou also, son of man take thee a tile, and lay it before 
    thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And lay seige against it, and build a fort against it, 
    and cast a mount against it, and set battering rams against it round about.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Moreover take unto thee an Iron pan, and set it for a 
    wall of Iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it 
    shall be besieged, and thou shaly lay siege against it. This shall be a sign 
    unto the House of Israel...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ezekiel 4:1-3).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The seige against Central 
  Europe and the Holy City began in ancient times and has continued unabated into 
  our own time. The Iron Curtain descended in the 20th century across the breadth 
  of the entire continent. This barrier not only divided the East from the West, 
  but more importantly the mind of European civilization from spiritual reality 
  itself. (Isaiah 27 to 29). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Babylonian historian, 
  Berosus (cited by Josephus), has preseved an apocryphal account of one Oannes, 
  from whom the name John (or Jochannan, as well as Jonah) is derived. (Luke 1:59-63). 
  We relate it here from Zenaide A. Ragozin's <i>The Story of Chaldea, From the 
  Earliest Times to the Rise of Assyria</i>:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When the priestly historian 
    of Babylon, Berosus, calls the older population 'men of a foreign race,' it 
    is because he belonged himself to that second race...who introduced their 
    own superior culture, and asserted their supremacy to the end of Babylon. 
    The national legends have preserved the memory of this important event, which 
    they represent as a direct divine revelation. Ea, the all-wise himself, it 
    was believed, had appeared to men and taught them things human and divine. 
    Berosus faithfully reports the legend, but seems to have given God's name 
    'Ea-Han' (Ea the Fish) under the corrupt form of Oannes. This is the narrative:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was originally at Babylon 
    a multitude of men of foreign race who had colonized Chaldea, and they lived 
    without order, like animals. But in the first year (of the new order of things--the 
    new dispensation) there appeared, from out of the Erythrean Sea </font>(the 
    ancient Greek name for the Persian Gulf...a tale which takes us back up the 
    Euphrates River to its source in the Garden of Eden)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    where it borders upon Babylonia, an animal endowed with reason called Oannes. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The whole body of this animal was 
    that of a Fish, but under the Fish's head he had another (human) head, and 
    also feet below, growing out of his Fish's tail, similar to those of a man; 
    also human speech, and his image is preserved to this day. Being used to spending 
    the Whole Day amidst men, without taking any food, he gave them an insight 
    into letters, and sciences, and every kind of art: he taught them how to found 
    cities, to construct temples, to introduce laws and to measure land; he showed 
    them how to sow seeds and gather crops. In short he instructed them in everything 
    that softens manners and makes up civilization...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN, the 
    monstrous Oannes used to plunge back into the sea and spend the night in the 
    midst of the boundless waves, for he was amphibious.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The elements of this legend, 
  the symbol of the Fish, the Going Down of the Sun, pertinant to the connection 
  that exists between the world view of John the Baptist and the prophet Muhammad, 
  is also pertinant, as is plainly seen, to the story of Jonah. Oannes is clothed 
  in the body of a Fish because the legend, as does the story of Jonah, anticipates 
  the Mystery of Christ and the Sea-ward journey of the Nation-Church. But also 
  because the Fish is a creature who can see both above and below the water, thus 
  a symbol of the soul who is spiritually amphibious, who can comprehend things 
  both human and divine; and of those who descend into the darkness of their own 
  souls as well, to search out the depths of every matter. The Fish is also the 
  correlated symbol of the Hebrew letter 'Nun,' whose numerical value is 50, the 
  number of the Great Jubilee.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Basic Meanings of the Characters...Nun, 
    the Fish...Fins and scales (exterior forms of the fish) are expressions of 
    balance, thus making them edible flesh (Leviticus 11:9). The fins indicate 
    direction (justice) unto knowledge. The scales indicate a covering (mercy) 
    and sanctifying of the Spirit. Via these two principles in proper balance 
    we attain to our fullest potential.&quot; </font>Bet HaShem Midrash, Sh'muel

  Spiritual with Spiritual</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Norma Goodrich makes what 
  seems to be a good case for an historical Arthur, finding in this figure from 
  myth and legend shadows of some last great chieftan and defender of the Celtic 
  realm in Britain; and perhaps the last Roman emperor, seeing, as she says, that 
  this Arthur is actually descended from the Celtic Queen Helena and her son Constantine. 
  If this is so, if we can place the tales of Arthur in a literal, historical 
  context, then we must see in this historical Arthur another figure of the spirit 
  of Antichrist in the world, seeing how he surrounded himself in all the garments 
  of the Mystery of Light while he went forth majestically, as all the other Nimrods 
  in the earth, to perform the terrible works of Darkness. And as such we have 
  a story with no higher meaning, or spiritual conclusion. We have a land still 
  wasted with destruction and spoiled with blood, and an order of fighting men 
  (brave knights one and all), with no commandment from the higher worlds to <i>Put 
  up the Sword, for those who live by the Sword shall perish by the Sword. </i>(Matthew 
  26:52, 53). &quot;I am the land that is poisoned and broken. I am the Tree that 
  is pulped to provide trivia. I am the soul of man that is swamped with filth 
  and degradation...&quot; quote Caitlin and John Matthews in their article entitled 
  <i>The Grail-less Lands</i>:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Humankind may have the governing 
    and ordering of the created world </font>(or he may imagine that he does)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    but it is also subject to the promptings of the inner worlds and their inhabitants. 
    These worlds and beings vary according to traditional cosmologies, but they 
    include the discarnate, the superhuman, the higher octave of the created Four 
    levels, (P.R.D.S.). This interpenetration of the microcosm by the macrocosm 
    is clearly visible on the Grail Quest in the hermits, totemistic helping beasts, 
    semi-divine kings, and otherworldly maidens who assist in the Grail quest.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Until the Grail can be brought 
    to the forefront of esoteric consciousness and magical work, it will remain 
    a pretty, medieval story, its transformative and healing powers locked up. 
    Those who have taken up the task of finding the Grail in order to heal the 
    Wasteland find that this is harder to manifest than it first appears. To enter 
    the Grail mysteries is to recognize that we are wounded ourselves...It means 
    to recognize that we have become separated, out of alignment, barren in spirit. 
    This Grail quest is about our relationship with this 'therapeutic illness' 
    and the most skillful means of establishing our wholeness/holiness...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Examination of the earliest legends 
    reveals the cause of the Wasteland is almost entirely due to a disregard for 
    the sacred spirit of the land: in Celtic terms, a rupture of the mystical 
    marriage between the King and the Goddess of the Land, Sovereignty; in medieval 
    terms, the failure of the king to maintain a balanced kingdom.&quot; </font>Caitlin 
    and John Matthews, Gnosis Magazine<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Goodrich, nevertheless, 
  allows for another Arthur, one more connected to the higher spiritual realities, 
  and unconsciously supports it in the extent of her own research into the esoteric 
  elements of the Arthurian cycle of stories. Had she access to the full dimension 
  of the Christ Mystery, and how it fills the very heavens and earth with itself--Westward, 
  she would agree with those scholars who she says have stressed a <i>mythological</i> 
  rather than a historical and geographically located king Arthur. (I have stressed 
  the word &quot;mythological&quot; because in the heavenly scheme of things, 
  the so-called Myth is the Reality):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sir James Frazer laid down 
    a general law of mythology, that illustrious names are always tabood...The 
    injunction extended with especial severity to the names of royal dead, for 
    which reason the name Arthur lay dormant for so many centuries, known but 
    seldom used, and not pronounced...This explains perhaps the widespread appearance 
    of this king in the early twelfth century, until which time he (or rather 
    his name) had remained unutterably holy...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to avoid the taboo of 
    names, people called their kings by some tribal totem, such as 'bear,' 'lion,'...At 
    Delphi and Thebes, as in Britain, the king was called 'dragon,' hence Arthur's 
    father, <a href="../UsedImages/dragon.gif">Uther Pendragon</a>. We err probably 
    in presuming that great kings ever disappeared from memory or imagination. 
    The reason is that their rites were transmuted first into mythology, and then 
    stored as pageants, stories, and tales...The Arthurians also survived in the 
    form of planetary deities, as astral mythology.&quot; <font size="2">The Holy 
    Grail, p.317</font>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The British king Arthur stirs 
    the hearts in our century as he has done for fifteen centuries. To us he stands 
    symbolically for the Alpha, the beginning, the Great A that recurs in so many 
    other proper names associated with the Holy Grail. It stood not only for Avalon, 
    the (mystical) Isle where Arthur housed his Grail, but also for Albania, which 
    he ruled as Ri Alban.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">King Arthur's northern origin again 
    brings to mind the Grizzly Bear, which figures as his totem on earth as in 
    the heavens. There the Great Bear becomes our Great Dipper circling <a href="../UsedImages/pg232.gif">the 
    North Star</a>. Merlin </font>(a priestly figure that stands directly between 
    the ancient Judeao-Druid tradition and the Judeao-Christian tradition)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    would have known it as he climbed nightly into his observatory.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the Bear to personify King 
    Arthur and the dragon </font>(Leviathan)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    to grace Arthur's penant, which Merlin caused to streak down the sky over

    has his favorite places, at least a hundred such named for him inside Great 
    Britain alone.&quot; <font size="2">(p.310)</font>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The derivation of the name 
    Arthur may very well be the ancient word 'father,' for in the cases of Gothic 
    and Gaelic the initial consonant had already been dropped in those languages. 
    Thus the word 'father' in Gothic was 'atta,' and in Irish 'aithair' and 'athir.' 
    The lengthening of the initial vowel 'a' before the sound of 'th' causes a 
    lowering influence, which might easily insert the low dental 'r' into the 
    first syllable, thus 'Arthur.' Then the Gaelic compounds 'all' + 'athair'...Thus 
    Arthur may have been also called Teutates, Father of His People, a name that 
    has survived on altars and tombstones...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mourned over the centuries, revered 
    as the noblest of rulers, loved as the dearest of fathers, King Arthur still 
    wields a magic that will not be dimmed. How could he have been less than altogether 
    some king of heaven, some god of war, a ruler of the seas, a god of light, 
    a giver of vision, and a lord of the zodiac? <font size="2">(pp.319, 320)</font>.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The real Arthur is another 
  cosmic figure, as is the combined figures of Hesus and Krishna (Jesus Christ), 
  and as the Germanic Wodin and the northern Thor, one that touches both heaven 
  and earth, the light as well as the darkness; and one that sought to express 
  in the thought-forms of the ancient Gaelic language, the same unfolding elements 
  of the Divine Mystery that were otherwise being expressed in the Kabbalistic 
  and priestly language of the Hebrew scriptures (including, of course, the Gospels). 
  For such adepts in the mysteries there was easy commerce between the Gaelic 
  language and the Hebrew, seeing how they both derived from the same root, and 
  from the same world-view. Islam expressed the same, (according to God's master 
  plan), and according to its own cultural lights, but also in the uniquely stylized 
  and perhaps even more highly expressive and imaginative qualities of both the 
  Arabic script and tongue. This hardly suggested to Islam that it was once, or 
  perhaps even twice removed from the central Mystery, but rather that it was 
  the greater heir and the focus of it all. Thus:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;According to the Prophet, 
    God created man 'upon His own form' or 'upon the form of the All-Merciful.'...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Divine Names mentioned in the 
    Qur'an are the archetypes of all creatures: the heaven and the earth and all 
    they contain, often referred to in the Qur'an as the 'Signs of God.' In their 
    multiplicity the individual creatures of the cosmos reflect the multiple Names 
    of God, and the cosmos as a whole reflects the 'All-comprehensive' name ALLAH, 
    or its near synonym the 'All-Merciful' (Al-Rahman). 'Call upon Allah, or call 
    upon the All-Merciful, whichever you call upon, to Him belong belong the Names 
    Most Beautiful.' (Sura 17.110).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time each human being, 
    made upon God's form, also reflects the name ALLAH: microcosm and macrocosm 
    are mirror images, and each in turn reflects God. Man's uniqueness lies in 
    the fact that he brings together all the realities of the universe in a summerized 
    and all-comprehensive unity.&quot; <font size="2">Islamic Spirituality, p.384</font>.</font></p>

  To literally take it upon one'self to execute another human being, in any way, 
  or for any reason, or to literally cut off another's hand or foot, is to literally 
  cut one'self off from the highest, and innermost meanings of the Mystery of 
  God itself. And to literally wage war in the ways of men, without contemplating 
  the commandment or the meanings, and the implications of the act of warfare 
  itself, is not only to fail to perceive the Universal Presence of Allah in all

    a dichotomy between earthly and spiritual power, but Muhammad's kingdom was

    where he become a recognized community leader and defeats Roman legionary 
    detachments sent against him; then a return in triumph eight years later as 
    the head of an armed force, with which he expels the Romans from Jerusalem 
    and restores Judaism to an earlier purity, one predating the corrupting influence 
    of Hellenistic paganism. Simon Peter would have rejoiced to be allowed finally

    the business house, the world and every personal existence in it are meticulously 
    ledgered. Each soul has its tally. The days and the years, in the most literal 
    sense, have their toll. 'Verily with Us is the accounting of them,' says Sura

    the Lesser Holy War. Only the Sufi (mystic) can wage the greater. What is 
    the Greater Holy War? The war against the soul...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact the Prophet said that every 
    verse in the Qur'an has 'an outside and an inside.' As to the outside verses, 
    the exoteric 'straight path' is the path of not deviating from the law of 
    Islam, whereas the movement of 'return' in its outermost sense is the passage 
    throug a pious life toward death...But the majority, apart from the fact that 
    they are not in general mentally disposed to take in more than one meaning 
    for one set of words, would have difficulty in understanding what the Sufis 
    mean by ''travel,' that is, the inward deepening or ebbing of the finite self 
    in the direction of the Divine Principle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On one occasion when returning 
    from a battle against the infidels, the Prophet said, 'We have come back from 
    the Lesser Holy War to the Greater Holy War.' His Companions asked, 'What 
    is the Greater Holy War?' And he answered: 'The war against the soul.' Here 
    lies the key to the inner meaning of all those verses in the Qur'an which 
    refer to Holy War and to the infidels...Most Muslims would claim to have had 
    experience of fighting against the inward infidels, that is, against the rebellious 
    non-muslim elements of the soul. But to resist temptation from time to time 
    is one thing and to wage war is another...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Qur'an says: Wage war on the 
    idolaters totally, and elsewhere, Fight them until there is no longer any 
    sedition, and religion is only for God. Only the mystic is capable of realizing 
    this inwardly, and only he (and she) knows what it is to keep up a methodic 
    opposition to his own lower possibilities and to carry the war into the enemy's 
    territory so that the whole soul may be 'for God.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Qur'an itself is a crystallisation 
    of this choice, for it insists without respite on the immense disparity between 
    the lower world and the transcendent world of the Spirit, (implying that one 
    is one, and one is the other), while on the other hand it continually inveighs 
    against the folly of those who choose the lower in place of the higher, the 
    worse in place of the better.&quot; </font>What Is Sufism, by Martin Lings,

  the Evening Sacrifice, and will connect the words together which say: <i>No 
  greater love than this, that one lay down their lives for their friends </i> 
  (John 15:13), and then, <i>Herein is our love perfected, that we may have boldness 
  in the day of judgment.</i> (1 John 4:17). These sons and daughters of God, 
  true Muslims everyone, will sort through the spiritual complexities of these 
  times and engage the Darkness--just as they did in the first century--only now 
  they will engage the Darkness in its most powerful, and most subtle form: the 
  American (and therefore the mainline Christian, Jewish and Muslim) state of 
  mind itself. The Word of God, which was held captive for centuries by the churchmen 
  and monarchs of Europe is now being held captive in America, and is being made 
  to serve the lofty imaginations of the religious and political leaders of the 
  American empire. This Remnant will not participate in physical, mortal combat 
  because this sort of warfare--this <i>vengeance of God</i> to the actual death, 
  as opposed to the spiritual death--is the realm and the domain of God alone, 
  and of those forces that God has reserved for Himself against the day of battle 
  and war. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We in the 20th century 
  are living in the very midst of the Divine Theophany. The whole world is filled 
  with the Terrible Majesty and the Glory of God. Those engaged in the Higher 
  Holy War are able to lift up their eyes to this reality, and to the universal 
  meaning of the words: <i>There is </i><font size="3">(absolutely)</font><i> 
  no Power but of God, the Powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore 
  resisteth the Power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and those who resist </i><font size="3">(those 
  who make war in return, or support war in the physical sense against any of 
  the other powers of the earth)</font>, <i>shall receive to themselves damnation</i>. 
  (Romans 13:1-5). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">How else could God reveal 
  His and Her own Invisible Presence to the world? and the nature of man to man 
  himsef? or show us the difference between good from evil? except by revealing 
  it--not only to us, but in us? The whole creative process had to come to the 
  very conclusion that it has, before They (They are ONE) could release the human 
  spirit into the age-to-come and the world-to-come. This, so that we would not 
  carry all of our natural, fallen ways in there with us. From the blazing Light 
  of Creation, and in the corresponding descent of God into Nature, and over time 
  into Human form, there came forth a form of Darkness that shrouded man's natural 
  eyes (his three-dimensional eyes), disenabling him from beholding the Invisible 
  Face of God. (Man's own physical eyes were created one dimension short of the 
  Beatific Vision). Yet from this same state of Darkness came the words&quot; 
  <i>And let there be Light.</i> Thus those who are coming to spiritual perfection 
  in our time can see into this hidden dimension, and stand in awe of the Terrible 
  Majesty of God as it is making itself known in all of the events of the 20th 
  century. They are all those who have come, at last, to the <i>foot</i> of the 
  Mountain of Revelation here in the West, as it is written: <i>Be ready against 
  the Third Day</i>. (Exodus 19:3-25; Hebrews 12:13-29). The Prophet, a man of 
  his own times, and of his own place, not having arrived at it himself, nevertheless 
  directs our attention to it:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And remember We took your covenant,</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And we raised above you (the Towering Height) of Mount 
    Sinai.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">(Saying): Hold firmly to what We have given you.</font></i><font size="+1"> 
    </font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Perhaps ye may fear God...</font></i><font size="+1">(Sura2.63).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">That Mount Sinai over 
  there (wherever you might want to locate it there in the East, for there is 
  vast disagreement), which rises above the barren landscape between Egypt and 
  Palestine, (whose surroundings bear absolutely no trace of the wanderings of 
  the children of Israel), is but another geo-allegorical reflection of the Higher 
  Reality that towers over the consciousness of the 20th century, and which truly 
  separates the mind of Darkness (Egypt) from the mind of Light. The apostle Paul 
  called the place <i>Arabia</i> as a further reference to those things that are 
  being fulfilled above, and here in the West, (Galatians 4:21-28)...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The vision of the Mount itself (Exodus 19) was a vision of 
  the 20th century and the Great Wars of our time. It is plain to every discerning 
  eye that these wars are not completed yet. <i>With every temptation</i>, however,<i> 
  God has made a way of escape. </i>(1 Corinthians 10:13), as it is also written: 
  <i>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will also keep thee from 
  the hour of temptation, which shall come upon the whole world, to try them that 
  dwell upon the earth. </i>(Revelation 3:10). What temptations are the Scriptures 
  referring to? The temptation to lose one's soul in these age-ending affairs, 
  and to give ourselves as <i>willing</i> victims to the western powers as they 
  rise up to wage their final efforts against God--as God in turn rises up in 
  the sum of all these events to liberate the elect Nation from its own captivity 
  in the lower world.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The way of escape in Islam 
  lies in the esoteric tradition, which has its own roots in the time, and in 
  the activities, of the Prophet himself. Being among those who first hear the 
  words of the Qur'an falling off the tounge of the Companions of the Prophet, 
  it was the earliest of these mostly anonymous <i>Sufi </i>mystics who received 
  these words with the most insight. Studying the ways of this new faith--Read! 
  Study! Rehearse! was the first comandment--but from a certain spiritual distance 
  from the others, and surely with knowledge of the esoteric tradition that preceded 
  Islam (or at least, of the fact that such a tradition existed), they were prepared 
  to arrive at another, inner meaning, not only to the words of the Qur'an but 
  of the extra canonical sayings and activities of the Prophet as well. These 
  adepts arrived at such meanings, even where the Prophet and his Companions were 
  too occupied to arrive at them themselves: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Hitherto he had relied on 
    argument and pursuasion to make proselytes, enjoining the same on his disciples. 
    His exortations to them to bear with patience and long-suffering the violence 
    of their enemies...emulated the meek precept of the Saviour, 'If they smite 
    thee on one cheek, turn to them the other also,'...But then he arrived at 
    a point where he completely divirged from the celestial spirit of the Christian 
    doctrines, and stamped his religion with the alloy of fallible mortality...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirteen years of meek endurance 
    had been rewarded by nothing but insult and injury...All these he might have 
    continued to bear with involuntary meekness, had not the means of retaliation 
    unexpectedly sprung to his reach. He had come to Medina, a fugitive seeking 
    asylum and craving merely a quiet home. In a little while, and probably to 
    his own surprise, he found an army at his command: for among the many converts 
    daily made in Medina...were men of resolute spirit, skilled in the use of 
    arms, and fond of partisan warfare. </font>(Allah gives men the desires of 
    their hearts)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Human passions and 
    mortal resentments were awakened by this sudden accession to power. They mingled 
    with that zeal for religious reform which was still his predominant motive. 
    In the exaltations of his enthusiastic spirit he endeavored to pursuade himself...that 
    the power thus placed within his reach was intended as a means of effecting 
    his great purpose, and that he was called upon by divine command to use it, 
    </font>(which he was...Isaiah 51:5)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Different prophets,' said he, 
    'have been sent by God to illustrate his different attributes...None of these 
    attributes, however, have been sufficient to enforce conviction, and even

    the last of the prophets, am sent with the sword! Let those who promulgate 
    my faith enter into no argument or discussion, but slay all who refuse obedience 
    to the law. Whoever fights for the true faith, whether he fall or conquer, 
    will assuredly receive a glorious reward.'&quot; </font>The Life of Muhammad<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

    is much remembered; and surely Allah will help him who helps His cause, most 
    surely Allah is Strong, Mighty...</font></i><font size="+1">(Sura 22.39,40).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is now plain to see 
  that Allah purposefully directed the Prophet and the Companions, and therefore 
  the greater number of Muslims throughout the centuries, along the lesser Path 
  (and for reasons that we can now begin to understand--as a eventual judgment 
  against Islam itself, and in the meantime as a judgment against the rest of 
  the Adamic world). Seeing where the Double-Path in Islam has lead, the true 
  adepts in our time (and all others who have parted from the purely literal path), 
  can, fittingly, trace their origins to those words which say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Had We sent down this Quran on a Mountain, you would certainly 
    have seen it falling down, splitting asunder because of the fear of Allah, 
    and We set forth these parables to men that they may reflect </font></i>(Understand 
    Hebrews 12:18-29)<i><font size="+1">...</font></i><font size="+1">(Sura 59.1).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the light of this verse 
    it was indeed to be expected, with regard to the Revelation on which Islam 
    is based, that such an overwhelming approach from God to man should have awakened, 
    in the opposite direction, a response from man to God which infinitely transcended 
    the mediocrity of exoterism. 'Without doubt. But when?' is perhaps an obvious 
    comment. There is no reason to suppose that the revelation of the Torah was 
    any less overwhelming, and in that case the esoterism seems to have taken 
    some time to develop, though it would be difficult to be certain at this point. 
    However that may be, the Quran is the herald of 'the Hour,' and one of Islam's 
    most striking features is precipitance </font>(lack of deliberation, rashness)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    The answer to 'when' is likely to be 'now,' and this urgency is implicit in 
    the following verse, which occurs in two of the very early suras: 'Surely 
    this (the Revelation) is a Reminder; so let him who will, take unto his Lord 
    a way' (73.19; 76.29). Islam is spoken of in general throughout the Quran 
    as 'the Way to God,' that is, the path ordained by God, which may be said 
    to include both esoterism and exoterism. But 'the Way to God,' mentioned only 
    in these two suras, is clearly the esoteric path, and the causality here is 
    strengthened by the word 'Reminder'--that which produces remembrance (dhikr), 
    which is itself the essence of Sufism.&quot; </font>The Nature and Origin
