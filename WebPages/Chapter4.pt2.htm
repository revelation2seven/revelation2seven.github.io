<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>The word came expressly to Ezekiel the priest…in the land 
    of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar, and the Hand of the Lord was there 
    upon him. </i>(Ezekiel 1:3)<i>... </i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Celtic historian, Conor MacDari, informs us that the word 
  <i>Chaldea</i> stems from the same Indo-European root as the word "caul," or 
  "veil," behind which the entire mystery of God has been hidden. (see Habakkuk 
  1:5,6). The river <i>Chebar</i>, means a river of &quot;time&quot;, or "of some 
  great distance away." (see Ezekiel 12:27). </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Behold, a whirlwind came out of the North…</i>(v.4)...</font> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The prophet beholds with his mind's eye the whole history of 
  Western civilization, and especially as it culminates in the events of the 20th 
  century, as it is written: <i>For the Lord will come with Fire</i> (War),<i> 
  and his chariots like a Whirlwind.</i> (Isaiah 66:15). This is the same Whirlwind 
  into which the spirit of the prophet Elijah (the spirit of John the Baptist) 
  ascended (2 Kings 2:1). The author of the Book of Revelation, projecting his 
  thoughts toward the end of this vision, toward the West, says: <i>I was in the 
  Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me</i> (in the East) <i>a great voice, 
  as of a trumpet</i>. (Revelation 1:10).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>A GREAT CLOUD, and a Fire infolding itself…</i>(v.4)...</font> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">There is the disciplined and focused Fire of Divine Wisdom, 
  which burns day and night upon the Holy Candlestick in the Temple of God, which, 
  when ignited (when its Light is <i>infolded</i> in the hearts of men), can avert 
  the judgments that are preparing to fall upon the Earth. (see Luke 12:49,50). 
  It seems, however, that the Fire men prefer will prove to be the great cleansing 
  Fire of human warfare itself. It is this Fire (the Fire which went behind the 
  children of Israel to show them the way that they should go--away from it), 
  that the American people seemed determined to ignite, and bring down upon themselves 
  in the end...see Revelation 18:8. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And a Brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof 
    as the colour of Amber…</i>(v.4)…</font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Amber flows from the center, or interior of the Tree, and symbolizes 
  the mysteries that were hidden and ensouled in the dimensions of Tree of Life 
  itself. The Brightness is the brightness of Varuna, the Clear Bright Sky. (see 
  Exodus 24:10). </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of Four 
    living creatures, and this was their appearance, they had the likeness of 
    a Man...</i>(v.5)… </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This <i>Man</i> is the supernal, or heavenly macrocosm, the 
  Celestial Man of Light, the Androgynous Adam Kadmon, the Angel of the Lord, 
  in whose image every human being is created; and who in turn is the expressed 
  reflection of the Presence of God as it makes itself known in the oracles of 
  Nature. (see Acts 13:38-41). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Four living creatures are reflected in the Four cardinal 
  points of the Heavenly Circle, through which the Sun passes on its voyage from 
  East to West every Day, and through which it passes on its Yearly curcuit through 
  the Four seasons, from the West, through Winter, Spring, Summer, and back to 
  the Harvest season in the West again. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Four faces do not only represent the faces of the Four 
  living creatures, or the Four cardinal points of the Heavenly Circle (or the 
  middle of each of the Four seasons of the year, and in the classic Christological 
  sense of things the Four Evangelists), but four of the Seven Spirits that light 
  up the Menorah in the temple of God, which include those of the Two Anointed 
  ones who will apear in our time at the place named Majesty on the Oracle. (See 
  Zechariah 3:9 and Zechariah, chapter 4). As we can see now, the Gospel narratives--through 
  the hidden channels that exist between one Sefira and another--can be referring 
  at one time to one corner of the Oracle and at another time to another, and 
  sometimes to the collective Center. They are not always referring to the same 
  individual, or to the same time in history: </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such channels are paths of reciprocal

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Paul was an ecstatic visionary 
    who experienced…visions of a heavenly being he called 'Christ' and the 'Lord,' 
    and the fact is that neither Paul nor any other first-century Christian felt 
    a need to distinguish between the heavenly being and the 'historical Jesus.' 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Paul) reveals the words of Jesus 
    in one such vision: 'my grace is sufficient for thee.' (2 Corinthians 12:1-4, 
    9). This is 'eyewitness' testimony of a saying of Jesus, one obviously not 
    recorded in the Gospels… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can do no better than to bring 
    our literary judgment to bear on such accounts, using the concept of two different 
    kinds of figures--the historical Jesus and the visionary Christ--in a way 
    the first century did not. When we return to Luke's first chapter, we should 
    perhaps recognize anew that there are both the 'historical Jesus' and the 
    Jesus of Luke's tradition, who has the same status as the figure known to 
    Paul and John the apocalypt… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what was the source of the 
    facts imparted to Paul?…Earlier he had written that the tradition which he 
    had handed on came to him from the 'Lord himself.' (1 Corinthians 11:23). 
    So we must understand that what Luke means by 'eyewitnesses' and what he means 
    by doing historical research, comparing sources, and judging the accuracy 
    of those sources, is not the same as what a modern historian would mean by 
    the same terms. What one learns from the 'traditions handed down to us from 
    the original eyewitnesses' must be seen as having the same status, for a first-century 
    thinker like Luke or Paul, as information gained from visions and from reading 
    the scriptures for predictions of Jesus.<font size="+1"> </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Gospels are about the figure 
    composed from these….strands of information; they are not about the 'historical 
    Jesus.' And that figure is a complex series of fictional creations; in the 
    case of the canonical Gospels, THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR FIGURES CALLED 'JESUS.'

  what I have done to the Egyptians</i> (the inhabitants of the whole world), 
  <i>and how I bare you on Eagle's wings and brought you unto myself.</i> (Exodus 
  19:4; 1 Thessalonians 4:17). Isaiah makes use of six wings in his vision, and 
  this because he is describing the mystery of the Chariot as it revealed itself 
  from the time of Aaron and Moses to our own, and from the farthest East to the

<p><font size="+1">The mystery of Christ being just as much a child of the Vedas 
  as it is the Torah, and because the Divine Mother was symbolized in the East 
  (as well as in Egypt) in the form of a Cow, so Her offspring moving Westward 
  are symbolized in the form of a calf, as it is written: <i>And ye shall go forth 
  as calves in the stall.</i> (Malachi 4:2). The burnished brass (or bronze), 
  symbolizes the human alloy that is being forged together out of the various 
  families and religious traditions of the earth, in the great furnace of spiritual 
  affliction which is America in the twentieth century. (Daniel 3:10; 1 Peter 
  1:7). (Please make the requisite distinctions between the doctrines of the Mormon 
  Church--the American religion--and the universal truth of matters that is unfolding 
  in the world in our time. The Church of Latter Day Saints will have to give

  the Mystery of Christ has been on for the last two thousand years, rising as 
  it did in the East, to descend again at the end of the age here at the Western 
  ends of the earth. We might also see with our own child's eyes, how every playful

<p><font size="+1">The Man and the Lion are the constellations Aquarius and Leo, 
  which lay on a line directly opposite each other on the Celestial Circle. We 
  will take this line, according to the words in Ezekiel, and lay it down on the 
  Right hand side of the Oracle, on top of that line which leads from the person 
  of Paul to the Messiahs in our time. And we will see that just as we in our 
  time are moving from the age of Pisces (which is understood in the symbol of 
  the Two Fishes with which Jesus fed the multitude…Matthew 14:15-20, and which 
  is further symbolized in astrological circles by the Two Feet of the universal 
  Man), into the age of Aquarius, so the symbol of Aquarius is placed at the Eighth 
  sefira on the Oracle. All of which is understood in the words: <i>When ye are 
  entered into the city</i> (into the gates of the Higher Jerusalem) <i>there 
  shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house 
  where he entereth in</i>…(Luke 22:10-12). As we faithfully follow the spirit 
  of the unfolding aquarian age, not looking back, nor getting entangled in the 
  affairs of the age that is ending, we will be led by the Spirit to an upper 
  room--that is to say, into a higher state of consciousness, where the mysteries 
  of the coming age will be revealed and the waters of Life will be poured out 
  anew. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And then we place the constellation Leo, the Lion, at the Fifth 
  sefira on the Right side of the Tree of Life named Power. This place also corresponds 
  to the location on the Oracle of the Strong Right Hand, and Mighty Arm of the 
  Lord, as it is written, <i>Who shall rouse Him up?</i> (Genesis 49:9). When 
  we place the center of the Oracle, Tifereth, or Beauty, in the center of Europe, 
  we see how the length of the Strong Right Arm extends up into Eurasia, and into 
  the lands of the "former" <a href="../UsedImages/pg178print.gif">Soviet Union</a>. 
  (Please understand Isaiah 63). (The other Arm of the Lord extends into the regions 
  of Islam, as it is written: <i>And mine ARMS shall judge the people</i>...Isaiah 
  51:5. But this is another chapter)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We do not want to get too far ahead of ourselves, or confuse 
  ourselves with too much imagry, but seeing how we have found ourselves here 
  in this part of the world, up in Eurasia, let us study those words in the Revelation 
  which say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And he had in his Right Hand Seven Stars; and out of his 
    mouth went a sharp Two-edged Sword; and his countenance was as the Sun shineth 
    in his strength.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my 
    Right Hand, and the Seven Golden Candlesticks. The Seven Stars are the angels

    Seven Churches...</font></i><font size="+1">(Revelation 1:16, 20)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">If one of the symbols of the Lord's Great Power is a lion (which 
  the spirit of Antichrist here in America, in its own ferociousness, seeks to 
  emulate...1 Peter 5:8; Revelation 13:2), it is also discovered in the symbol 
  of the Bear. And it is this very symbol of the Seven Stars of the Great Bear 
  Constellation, Ursa Major, that the Lord is holding in his <a href="../UsedImages/pg547.gif">Powerful 
  Right Hand</a>, as it is also written: <i>Arise devour much flesh</i>. (Daniel

  the interpretation with purely Christian (or rather Catholic) imagry, when it 
  typically fails to account for the original seers, the original true shepherds 
  of the people, the Rishis of old--who still dwell among us. These are those 
  who (out of every religious tradition) are One with the mysteries of the higher

    universe...god-inhabited, paradisal. Around Meru (Zion) in one guise or another 
    the whole panoply of heaven and earth was built. Meru as a developed myth 
    is absent from the Rig Veda, which does not go beyond the ill-defined skambha, 
    or world axis. But it could have been known to the western Indo-Aryan branch.

  the East, and link the Seven Rishis to the cosmic center, and both to the Seven 
  stars of the Great Bear Constellation, Ursa Major (of which we will have more 
  to say in the chapter on Russia and the holy angels).</font></p>

  priesthood, <i>called of God and not of men</i> (1 Corinthians 9:8-12/Deut.25:4; 
  Hebrews 5:1-4), of which the ancient Levitical order was a type and image. This 
  spiritual order has been pulling the plow, turning up the soil of the human 
  heart, and sowing into it the seed of divine Thought all these centuries, as 
  it is written: <i>Now hear the parable of the sower...</i>(Matthew 13:12-18; 
  Amos 9:13-15). Place the sign of Taurus on the Left side of the Oracle, on the 
  Solar side, at the place where John the Baptist appeared in the time of Love. 
  See the Mystery of Christ sowing its way across the times, arriving at last 
  in the West at the sign of the constellation...Scorpio. Ezekiel places the sign 
  of the Eagle here. This Eagle is a symbol of the Higher mind, the Scorpion of 
  the lower. This Eagle, however, also has its own higher and lower aspects. It 
  symbolizes both the mind of Christ, and the mind of Antichrist which seeks to 
  be like Christ. (Habakkuk 1:5-9). Thus it is written: <i>Where the eagles are 
  gathered together there shall the Body be.</i> (Luke 17:30-37)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But we know that the prophet is also implying the constellation 
  Scorpio, because he says right afterwards--referring to the days wherein we 
  are called to <i>Stand upon our Feet</i> here in the West: <i>And thou son of 
  man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briars 
  and thorns</i> (the cares of the world) <i>be with thee, AND THOU DOST DWELL 
  AMONG SCORPIONS.</i> (Ezekiel 2:6). And Paul, also looking into these days, 
  says:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Ezekiel goes on in the first chapter to describe in epic, symbolic 
  terms the things that have come to pass over the course of the history of the 
  world. But notice again, he is only describing the Western half of the mystery, 
  from the time of Christ to our own. This is the realm of the Son--the Lamb. 
  (Exodus 4:22; Psalm 2; John 1:29). Why is he called a Lamb? Because in the West, 
  where the mind of Christ is being brought to perfection, those who are coming 
  to perfection are continually being called upon to offer the great Non-violent 
  Yajna, a Sacrifice of themselves. In so doing they are laying a righteous, as 
  well as a wholly spiritual foundation upon which to build the age to come. (Compare 
  Romans 11:15 and 1 Corinthians 15:12-30; and then learn how to connect these 
  things to the words in Ezekiel, chapter 37). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And then this aspect of the Mystery of Christ (the son) is 
  likened to a Lamb because the realm of the Father, whose sign is Aries, the 
  Ram, lying on the Eastern horizon, is the very same out of which the Divine 
  Father is now rising to deliver the Lamb. Look into Russia and China as it is 
  also written: <i>In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.</i> (Genesis 22:13,14). 
  This is also what Ezekiel is describing when he says <i>A wheel within, or in 
  the midst of a wheel</i>. (Ezekiel 1:25; 10:1-7). It is the history of the spiritual 
  race being brought to perfection in the midst of the greater circle of all the 
  other spiritual events surrounding it--one Holy Nation in the midst of all other 
  nations, as it is also written: <i>For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a 
  wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</i> (Zechariah 
  2:5). When the seraphims, which symbolize all the other principalities and powers

<p><font size="+1">Lloyd M. Graham, in a courageous attempt to overturn the notion 
  of the need for God in the universe--in his <i>Deception and Myths of the Bible</i>--nevertheless 
  challenges us in a very forthright way to arrive (or re-arrive) at some meaningful 
  conclusions concerning the Scriptures, which he says reflect not reality but 
  a perversion of it, one foisted upon us by a priestly caste hell-bent on maintaining 
  its power and privileges in the earth. We fall in line with his righteous indignation 
  concerning the worldly-religious institutions of this age, and the unholy arrangements 
  they have made between themselves and the political powers of the earth, but 
  we contend that the problem is not necessarily with the Scriptures but with 
  the way they have been translated and interpreted since the time of Christ. 
  The problem lies between those priests (male and female alike) who were (and 
  are) ordained by God (for whom the Scriptures are an oracle), and those who 
  are ordained by men. Those who are of the world cannot interpret the writings 
  of those who are, or were of the Spirit. It is part of the mystery of the Word 
  itself, as it is written: <i>There must be heresies among you, that they which 
  are approved might be manifest.</i> (1 Corinthians 11:19). While Graham himself 
  stumbles right over the root of the Tree of Life and the countenance of the 
  Great Dragon in his narratives, he comes closer than many "theologians" in describing 
  the real nature of what he says "we mistake for God," and what he says we mistake 
  for our "so-called" mystery of Christ--which he further says, and rightly so 
  (in many ways) is but a rearrangement of the pagan mysteries to suit the Christian 
  view of the world. We are unskilled in the Word of God if we cannot take him 
  seriously in these matters, answering him not with zealous and frenzied denial, 
  but with the simple realization that the pagan mysteries grew out of the Hebrew 
  state of mind to begin with, and that the Universal Mystery of Christ is the 
  fulfillment of them all. He says, however:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In spite of our so-called enlightenment 
    millions still believe that God controls the weather, when it is actually 
    the Sun." </font>(Well? That sounds right to me)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    "Where the Babylonian poet saw only the action of the deified forces of nature 
    the Hebrew writer saw the working of God." </font>(Exactly)!<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font><b> 
    </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...f</font><font size="+1">or this is exactly what separates 
  the <i>Hebrew</i> mind from all others. He goes on to say, expressing the sentiments 
  of every fervent Humanist: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There is no intelligent or moral 
    force in creation--save that which man is becoming--and no guiding principles 
    save those that exist in the depths of nature itself, violence and indifference…again, 
    save those that man attains and impresses upon himself:" </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 'original sin' was the sin 
    of creation--what could be more original? However the word is wrong; it should 
    be crime. But as sin is the biggest thing priests can think about, they called 
    it sin, and made it human to incriminate man and absolve the Creator. Yet 
    if this world, with all its pain and suffering, is the work of a self-conscious 
    Being, then creation is a crime and its Creator a criminal. From this there 
    is only one escape-unconscious Causation…&quot; (p.64).<font size="+1"></font></font><b><font size="+1"> 
    </font></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Graham catches every believer here and makes us give thought. 
  We feel the weight of his indictment, and have agonized with God over it ourselves. 
  In fact, years ago, when this work was just beginning, as I was reading the 
  sacred texts through for the first time, and encountering the reality of it 
  all in my own mind, also realizing that I was being asked to rationalize and 
  explain God's (Nature's) tremendously violent behavior, I went through fits 
  of refusal. (It was a stark realization. Either Graham was right or the God 
  I worshipped as a child--was indeed, responsible for it all). Slowly, however, 
  I came to understand it at another level, in terms of the illusion, or the transitory 
  state of our present reality itself (and yes, the tremendous pain and the suffering). 
  Nevertheless, we must understand something very profound about our present spiritual 
  reality, we are still in the process of being created. We are only now approaching 
  the full impact of the words: <i>Let us make man in our image.</i> God is transferring 
  the full content of Their thoughts and emotions into ours'--revealing every 
  aspect of Themselves so that there can be no doubts or serious spiritual or 
  mental conflicts afterwards, concerning who our Parents really are, what they 
  are like, and what we can talk to them about--everything. They understand everything. 
  It is <i>Glasnost</i> in its highest form, unfolding as it is on the world-wide 
  plain of human events. The violence of it all cannot be understood outside of 
  the realization of what it ultimately means to be created in God's image: for 
  one part of God is indeed fierce and terrible (which image we shall have learned 
  never to conjure up again in the future, through our own unrighteous deeds, 
  of which we also had to be made capable if we were to ultimately stand upon 
  our own feet as truly free Christlike beings). It is a Christ-conscious spirit 
  that God is creating in us. But in the whole economy of relationship between 
  God and the emerging Christ-spirit in the world, the latter could not have been 
  created in any other way outside of the manifestation of the first. If we had 
  been made to act just instinctively (thus with nothing in us but good), as opposed 
  to consciously (with the potential for evil always with us), we could become 
  neither "manlike" or divine. That is, we could never proceed from the natural 
  state of mind, and this natural existence--as true sons and daughters of God--to 
  the next. And besides, we would always have this lingering suspicion of God, 
  that They held something back from us--the dark side of Their own thoughts--and 
  we would remain in a constant pursuit of it. (Genesis 3:1-13). Being wise Parents, 
  the Creators have taken this time in history to reveal the Darkness in all of 
  its splendour--not only to us but in us...as well as in Themselves.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> In his <i>The Book of Job as a Greek Tragedy</i>, Horace M.

  in Hebrew form, with Hebrew archetypes rather than Greek, but nevertheless in 
  the Greek spirit of the theatre. He says,</font> <font size="+1">"It is now 
  more than half a century since I restored the Book of Job to what I believe

<blockquote>

    art and society: all that they did know seems to have derived from the Greeks…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr Moulten suggests that this is 
    due to the lack of theatre, and attributes to this lack, the spread of the 
    obvious dramatic impulse among the Jews through other literary forms, until 
    epic, lyric, discourse, are all drawn together…For him, hence, the Book of 
    Job, the bulk of which is in dialogue form, is a complete and integrated composition, 
    'a dramatic poem framed in an epic life,' but not a drama. For Ganung, Job 
    is an 'epic of the inner life,' but not a drama; for Nathaniel Schmidt it 
    is at most a dialogue after the fashion of Plato, or more generously, of 'Aeschylus 
    in Prometheus Bound,' but not a drama. Most writers, in fact, who assign Job 
    any dramatic character at all, attribute this character to Greek influence,

<p><font size="+1">Kallen's remedy comes in knowing which way to point in this 
  instance to "Jewish soil"--not southwards to Palestine, but Northwards toward 
  the center of Europe--and in knowing how the dramatic arts fell out of this 
  higher state of mind into the Greek way of life to begin with (as did the whole 
  oral tradition), all in humanity's attempt to emulate in their own natural lives 
  the meanings of the mysteries of life itself. Except that the <i>Greeks</i> 
  wound up, not with the reality but with images of it: with stage plays and stage 
  actors, and finally (with marvelous and important exceptions, of course), with 
  an industry full of movie and television <i>stars</i> who, in keeping with the 
  decadence of these times (2 Timothy 3:-5), and chasing the bright lights of 
  personal fame and fortune, have become blatantly shallow-minded, frivalous, 
  deceptive, cliched, dirty-mouthed, self-important, violent, unaware, insincere, 
  and for sale, whose chief occupation is more to tend their own sense of themselves 
  in the eyes of the public, than the higher minds of those who feed upon those

    Greeks. Their theatres were not much like ours. They were all outdoors. The 
    seats on a sloping hillside. The stage was a circle of grass. At first the 
    Greek theatres were not used for plays. They were used for songs and dances 
    in honour of the Greek gods.&quot; </font>From a Children's Encyclopedia.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The development of Greek

  "As the story stands Jesus partakes with his disciples of the Passover, an evening 
  meal. After a brief dialogue they sing a hymn and proceed in darkness (the long 
  night of the Mystery) to the Mount of Olives (to the Foot of the Mystery…see 
  Zecharaiah 14:4). Nothing is said of what happened or was spoken on the way."

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is not very likely that 
    anyone who went to the grave on the first Easter Sunday met an angel who announced 
    that Jesus had been raised from the dead. Modern exegetes are unanimous in 
    interpreting the angel as a legendary figure, drawn from apocalyptic literature 
    and used as a mouthpiece for the faith of the early church…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But mythical though he is, the 
    angel is the centerpiece of the story, and if we interpret his role properly 
    we will have answered many of the questions that cluster around Jesus' tomb. 
    In contrast to the stone at the tomb, which functions in the Easter drama 
    like a silent Greek choragus who warns us how not to interpret the scene, 
    the angel has a speaking part and he directs us positively to what the Jerusalem 
    church thought was the significance of Jesus' grave. The angel was invented 
    to act as a role model for the listener, and he speaks forth what the community 
    thought was the proper response to the empty tomb, namely the affirmation 
    'Jesus has been raised.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHO, THEN, IS THIS ANGEL? I PROPOSE 
    THAT WE TAKE HIM FOR WHAT HE REALLY IS: NOT A SUPERNATURAL BEING WHO ACTUALLY 
    APPEARED IN A TOMB ONE SUNDAY MORNING, BUT A DRAMATIC PERSONA WHO WAS INVENTED 
    TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE CHRISTIAN LEGEND. Later readers of the legend who mistake 
    him for a real angel…misunderstood the literary form, and therefore the point 
    of Mark's Gospel. The Easter narrative, both in its pre-Marcan oral form and 
    in the gospel version, is a legend, not a historical account. IT IS STRUCTURED 
    IN THE FORM OF A DRAMA, A RELIGIOUS PLAY, AND THEREFORE COULD BE MISTAKEN 
    FOR A PIECE OF HISTORY. However, in order to grasp the story according to 
    its proper literary form--and therefore the way in which it was originally 
    meant to be understood--I propose to treat the text at Mark 16:1-8 explicitly 
    as a drama, which I call Easter at the Tomb. If we look at the Easter legend 
    as a religious play, the 'angel' who appears at the tomb is, in fact, an actor 
    who recites dramatic lines that were created for him, first by the early Jerusalem 
    community…and then by the evangelist Mark.This approach may be strained at 
    points, but it does help clarify how the Easter legend developed from the 
    early oral version to Mark's written account and beyond.&quot; </font>The

    stay in Rome he wrote an account of the Lord's doings, not, however, declaring 
    all of them, nor yet hinting at the secret ones, but selecting what he thought 
    most useful for increasing the faith of those who were being instructed. But 
    when Peter died a martyr, Mark came over to Alexandria bringing both his own 
    notes and those of Peter, from which he transferred to his former book the 
    things suitable for whatever makes for progress toward knowledge. Thus he 
    composed a more spiritual Gospel for the use of those who were being perfected. 
    Nevertheless, he yet did not divulge the things not to be uttered (2 Corinthians 
    12:4), nor did he write down the hierophantic teaching of the Lord, but to 
    the stories already written he added yet others and, moreover, brought in 
    certain sayings of which he knew the interpretation would, as a mystagogue, 
    lead the hearers INTO THE INNERMOST SANCTUARYY OF THE TRUTH HIDDEN BY SEVEN 
    VAILS. Thus, in sum, he prepared matters, neither grudgingly nor incautiously,

    The feeding of the Five Thousand and the story of the 153 fishes clearly show 
    that certain New Testament stories were composed as initiatory spiritual allegories. 
    We may call them 'initiatory' for the simple reason that THEY PRESUPPOSE A 
    MOVEMENT FROM THE OUTER WORLD OF MANIFEST FORM TO THE INNER PERSPECTIVE OF 
    GENUINE INSIGHT. They were intended both to entertain and to edify at an outer 
    level, designed to bring enjoyment even to children, yet they were also designed 
    to possess within A DEEPER, HIDDEN DIMENSION, REFLECTING THE HARMONIC NATURE 
    OF THE COSMIC PATTERN. However, since the unknown scholars who composed these 
    tales, based upon the ancient models, were intentionally crafting vehicles 
    for the transmission of spiritual insight, it is unlikely that they desired 
    their teaching stories ultimately to be read in literal or historical terms.

<p><font size="+1">David E. Aune, in a work entitled <i>Prophecy in Early Christianity, 
  and the Ancient Mediterranean World,</i> explores the use of oracles, not only 
  in the maintenance of the religious life of the Greco-Roman world at that time 
  but in the very formation of Christianity itself. Of those "unknown authors" 
  of the Gospels he says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;One issue is the problem 
    of the relationship between the prophetic utterances of Christian prophets 
    and the transmission of the sayings of Jesus. Another is concerned with the 
    Christian prophet as a charismatic exegete of the OT scriptures. If it can 
    be demonstrated that Christian prophets, speaking in the name of the risen 
    Jesus, made substantial contributions to the collection of sayings of the 
    earthly Jesus, our knowledge of the transmission of gospel tradition will 
    be immensely enriched. (p.22)...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Divination may be defined as the 
    art or science of interpreting symbolic messages from the gods. Often these 
    symbols are unpredictable or even trivial. Oracles, on the other hand, are 
    messages from the gods in human language, received as statements from a god, 
    usually in response to inquiries. The term 'oracle' is also used for the place 
    where such messages are requested and received.(p.23)... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many modern NT scholars…theorized 
    that early Christian prophets played a major role in the transmission, formulation, 
    and even the creation of the sayings of Jesus. This process is thought to 
    have occurred primarily during the period (30-70 AD) when the gospel tradition 
    had not yet been written down in the form of the Gospels. According to this 
    view the oracles of Christian prophets, proclaimed in the first person as 
    utterances of the risen Lord, gradually became intermingled with sayings of 
    the historical Jesus… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the central assumptions 
    of advocates of the theory that many of the sayings of Jesus in the synoptic 
    gospels originated in early Christian prophetic activity is that Christians 
    made no essential or lasting distinction between sayings of the historical 
    Jesus and post-Easter oracles from the risen Lord. Consequently oracles in 
    the 'I' style, uttered by the risen Lord through prophetic spokesmen gradually 
    became assimilated to collections of sayings stemming from the historical 
    Jesus. Proponents of this view point to the oracles in the Apocalypse of John 
    that are in the form of sayings of the risen Jesus: (Revelation 1:17-20; esp. 
    3:20; 16:15; 22:12). Revelation 3:20 and 16:15 will serve as examples of these 
    oracles in the 'I' style: 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; If anyone 
    hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, 
    and he with me.' 'Lo, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who is awake, 
    keeping his garments That he may not go naked and be seen exposed.' A similar 
    oracle is found in the Odes of Solomon 42:6. 'And I have risen and am among 
    them, And I speak through their mouth.' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These oracle are cited for three 
    reasons: (1) they are clear indications that early Christian prophets did 
    in fact prophecy in the first person of the risen Lord. (2) the form of those 
    sayings is such that could possibly have entered the traditions of the sayings 
    of Jesus, and (3) the authority of such prophetic utterances would ensure 
    their acceptance by Christian communities as sayings of Jesus&quot;…</font>David

<p><b><font size="+1"></font></b><font size="+1">Every student of these affairs 
  will begin to see how Paul's gospel itself is a chief source of the later Gospel 
  narratives (Romans 2:16), thus how subtily those Gospel narratives are interwoven 
  with the doctrines and the affairs of the "historic" Paul, or rather this mysterious 
  Paul--whose real name was not Paul, or Saul, at all. (But this is the subject 
  of another chapter). The lesson is that the Jesus (or the Hesus) of the Gospels 
  is not an historical person, but is rather another of the many manifestations 
  of the Lord, but here in the personification of the Suffering Servant, the Sacrificial 
  Victim, the true Pacifist--which of necessity appears in conjunction with the 
  Hebrew warrior archetype, Jehoshua. Which is why it took the early church fifty 
  years or more to work out their spiritual frame of reference. The writers had 
  to bring together into one Corporate state of mind (according to the structure 
  and the dimensions of the Oracle) the truthes of all the other religious traditions 
  that surrounded them; merge them with fitting historical events, as well as 
  with events that they could see--by studying the oracles--would come to pass 
  at the end of the age. All of this had to be assimilated, not only to the revelations 
  of Paul but to the words of the Prophets, which the Gospels would accompany 
  to the end of the age. The Baptist was Jesus, even as he was initiating others 
  into the mystery of Jesus. Paul was Jesus in a most particular way, as we shall 
  see, as were all of the other followers of Christ at that time. When the Romans 
  put Jesus on the Cross it was thousands who were hung there, not just one. Jesus 
  (Hesus) is the central figure in the great cosmic drama of human transformation, 
  one that unites heaven and earth, and reconciles all things on earth to each 
  other; and especially those things that are said to have happened then with 
  the things that shall happen now. </font></p>

    obscure descriptions of the details of the Merkabah was subsequently taken 
    up by visionaries in the pre-Christian era, who sought to repeat the experience 
    of the vision of the Merkabah (the vision of the Chariot and the Throne), 
    and particularly in the first two centuries of the Christian era. Retaining 
    Ezekiels's terminology (like the term, the son of man), while reinterpreting 
    its meanings, his description was transformed by them into a depiction of 
    the royal court of the Divine Majesty. This vision was revealed to the visionary

    vision of the Shape of God on the throne…became an object of contemplation 
    and speculation. The ascent of the Merkabah mystics to heaven or, in a different 
    version, to the heavenly Paradise, was considered successful if it not only 
    led the mystic to the divine throne but also brought them a revelation of 
    the image of the Godhead, the 'Creator of the Universe' seated on the throne.…

    for the Jewish consciousness, the more problematical the meaning of this vision

    namely THE MANNER IN WHICH THE JEWISH GNOSTICS AND MERKABAH MYSTICS CONCEIVED 
    OF THE MYSTICAL FORM OF THE GODHEAD: THE 'SHI'UR KOMAH.' This Hebrew term 
    is often translated as 'MEASURE OF HEIGHT,' the noun komah being construed 
    in its biblical sense as 'height' or 'stature.' Such a rendering is valid, 
    particularly given the appearance of this word in the Song of Songs. Nevertheless, 
    'komah' most likely has the precise signification here that it has in Aramaic, 
    where it means quite simply 'body.' Indeed the body of the Creator or Demiurge 
    is also called THE 'BODY OF THE GODHEAD.'… Thus it is rhapsodically promised

    HAS IMPLANTED HIS STRENGTH...IS ALSO THE TREE OF THE WORLD. Its root is located 
    in the highest Sefiroth; its trunk embraces the central and thereby conciliating 
    forces; while its branches or limbs which grow out of it at various points 
    encompass the contradictory forces of divine activity… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sefiroth are thus not a series 
    of ten emanations of aeons emerging from one another; on the contrary they 
    constitute a well-structured form, in which every part or limb operates upon 
    every other, and not just the higher ones on the lower. The Sefiroth are connected 
    with one another by means of 'secret channels,' whereby each radiates into 
    the other and in which the other is in turn reflected. The specific nature 
    of each potency is deeply rooted in itself, but every potency likewise contains 
    some aspect of all the others…It is through this process of infinite reflection 
    that the whole is reflected in every member and thus…becomes a whole. </font>Scholem,

<p><font size="+1">We can see into the structure of this Mystery in the fact that 
  the Scriptures have the Christ-child being born <i>six months</i> after John 
  the Baptist. (Luke 1:26...See it in then oracles). This text carries the birth 
  story out of those times to our own, and to the words at Revelation 12:1,2. 
  It has everything to do with the realization that the Christ-child is not only 
  born in every generation but in every human birth. It tells us that what was 
  born in those days is being born again in our days. This Child of Revelation, 
  this emerging state of Higher Consciousness--Christ-Consciousness/ Buddha Consciousness--leads 
  all who are being born (again) with it into the Coming Age. (Please consider 
  the following chapter).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Some New Testament apocryphal books tell of the Christ child's 
  early years, of his mischieviousness, his magic stunts, and youthful power trips 
  over his playmates. Christianity, of course (or certain parts of it), was given 
  to literary flights of fancy in those times, but these particular stories seem 
  to be some author's insightful, and fittingly satirical account of the formative 
  years of this whole religious movement itself. But we have come to a full age. 
  We look around and see that it is not some one individual alone that is full 
  of magic, but the whole world, and the Universe itself, in which we live and 
  breath and have our being.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Nor must we fail to see the (apocryphal as well as historical) 
  connection that exists between the figure of John the Baptist, the "son of Zacharias" 
  (Luke 1:5), and the Book of Zechariah, whose pages are also opening up and having 
  their effect in our time. And what of Elizabeth, the mother of John? She appears 
  in the story, and then she is gone. Her name reveals exactly who She is. She 
  is another, literary manifestation of the Divine Mother. Her name derives from 
  a combination of the word El (one of God's many names), and the term "Sabet,"or 
  "Sebat." Thus &quot;El-Sabet.&quot; This name embodies the concept of the number 
  Seven. Elizabeth is literally, or rather an allegorical embodiment of those 
  mysteries that proceed from the Divine Mother, and which must also have their 
  fulfillment here at the Western ends of the earth, as it is written: <i>Behold, 
  I send you Elijah...</i>(Malachi, chapter 4).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Who then is Mary, whose name means "the Sea," or "the Waters 
  of Life?" Her namesake, Miriam, led the children of Israel in song at Exodus 
  15:20,21, one that presaged the song of Hannah at 1 Samuel 2:1-10, and Mary's 
  at Luke 1:46-55. One publication asked: &quot;But who was the Virgin Mary? Where 
  was she born? How did she live? Where did she come from? Where did she go? Why 
  was she a virgin? Why was this virgin espoused to a man named Joseph? Why was 
  he of the house of DVD? Why did she say that all generations shall call her 
  blessed? Why is it that no historical record whatever--in all the world--not 
  one recognizes the existence of this most wonderful personage which the world 
  ever had in it?&quot; </font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><i>They said: How should we speak to one who was a child

  <p><font size="+1"><i>He (the child in the cradle) said: Surely I am a servant

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The account in the Quran is, of course, purely apocryphal. 
  The Quran knows the mystery even if Islam (and even if Christianity) does not. 
  The virgin in this story has withdrawn herself to the Sacred Tree, and has safeguarded 
  the mystery within her until the appointed time. The last we hear of her in 
  the Gospels she is also beneath the Sacred Tree. She is one of Three Marys. 
  (Perceive how the mysteries are constructing themselves here). The Son looks 
  down upon her and the Apostle John, and he says to the Apostle: <i>Behold thy 
  Mother</i>. <i>And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.</i> (John 
  19:25-27). Mary is, of course, a Christian representation of the otherwise "pagan" 
  concept of the Heavenly Mother, the Goddess of Fertility, with corn or wheat 
  as a symbol of her fertility.</font><font size="+1"> Her name is the same as 
  Miriam, and none other than Myrrha, the mother of the beautiful Adonis in pagan 
  mythology, and Maia, the mother of Mercury (Acts 14:12) and Buddha. She is Isis, 
  wed to the mysteries of Egypt (Joseph-Osiris-the Word), whose child, Horus the 
  Hawkeyed, soared up into heaven to behold the entire kingdom of Egypt, from 
  its upper regions in the East to its lower regions in the West, and everything 
  in between. (See it in the oracles). Mary is the Divine Mother in another of 
  Her many literary manifestations. She is the Holy Shekinah of God who committed 
  Herself at that time, not only to the dimensions of the Solar Mystery of Christ, 
  but--as the fullest representation of the Divine Feminine Principle, the Moon--to 
  a state of complete occultation until the fulness of these times. She appears 
  again in the words: <i>And there appeared a Great Wonder in heaven, a Woman 
  Clothed With the Sun.</i> (Revelation 12:1,2).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> She was reported to be the daughter of Anna, a figure who 
  hearkens back not only to Hannah but to those ancient Druid beliefs that gave 
  rise to the myth of the virgin goddess Di-anna, the Moon, the balanced half 
  of Appolo, the Sun. (Isaiah 30:26). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Look further into the oracles and see how the constellation 
  Virgo is descending into the affairs of our times, not only to the words in 
  Revelation, chapter 12, but to the full meaning of those which say: <i>Behold, 
  a Virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a "son," and they Shall 
  call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is "God with us."</i> (Matthew 
  1:23)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Mary is the Sea (the embryonic fluids of the world), out of 
  which these mysteries are being born. She is the Waters that covered the Navel 
  Stone of the Mystery hidden within Her. She is the Three Marys, the Past, the 
  Present, and the Future: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>There were three who always walked with the Lord: `Mary 
    his mother and her Sister and Magdalene, the one who was called his companion. 
    His sister and his Mother and his companion were each a Mary...</i>(The Gospel 
    of Phillip)<i>. </i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">She is the Mother, Sister, and Lover. In her fallen state she 
  is Gwenifere of the Authurian cycles (a symbol of the modern Church). In her 
  perfected state She is the Magdalene, whose devils are all vanished. She is 
  also Brigid who became Mary. She is the Goddess Sophia, Divine Wisdom. She is 
  both Lillith and Eve, the mother of all human experience. She is the Three Jerusalems. 
  (Ezekiel 16:46)...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/ThreeCities.gif" width="700" height="512"></p>
<p><font size="+1">She is that city in the East named Samaria. She is that City 
  which is completing its pilgrimage here in the West. And She is that City Above 
  in the center, the Mother of Us All. (Galatians 4:26). She is the Lady of the 
  Lake; She is the Matronit; She is the Holy Spirit--She is ONE with God. She 
  is the Sabbath. She is every Mother. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As the Sun rises in the East every morning, and sets in the 
  West every evening, so this present age began with the rising of the Spiritual 
  Sun in the East almost two-thousand, or 40 Jubilees of years ago, and is coming 
  to its conclusion as the Sun sets here in the West in this fulness of time. 
  With this understanding, and with a growing ability to read the oracles, we 
  can fully understand the words which say: </font></p>
