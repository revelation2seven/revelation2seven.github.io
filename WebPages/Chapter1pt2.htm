<p align="center">THE TEN SEFIROT</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;(The study of the Tree of 
    Life) focuses ultimately on the Ten sefirot. By penetrating the literal surface 
    of the Torah, the mystical commentators transform the biblical narrative into 
    a biography of God. The entire Torah is read as a divine name </font>[The 
    Four letters of the Divine Name, YHVH, 10 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 26 in the Hebrew numerical 
    system, as do the Four Sefirot that appear along the Central Pillar of the 
    Tree, 1 + 6 + 9 + 10].<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Even a seemingly 
    insignificant verse can reveal the inner dynamics of the sefirot--how God 
    feels, responds, and acts, how She and He relate intimately with each other 
    and with the world. The opening chapter of Genesis appears to describe the 
    creation of the world, but it alludes to a more primal beginning--the emanation 
    of the sefirot, their emergence from the Infinite, or <i>Ein Sof </i>(literally 
    &quot;Endless&quot;). In contrast to the personal God of the sefirot, Ein 
    Sof represents the radical transcedence of God. Not much more than its Name 
    can be said...&quot; </font>The Essential Kabbalah, by Daniel C. Matt, p.7<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;From above to below, the 
    Sefirot depict the drama of emanation, the transition from Ein Sof </font>(that 
    unfathomable Nature of God--the Nothingness that resides at the Center of 
    all reality)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, to creation. In the 
    words of Azriel of Gerona, 'They constitute the process by which all things 
    come into being and pass away.' From below to above, the Sefirot constitute 
    a ladder of ascent back to the One. The union of Tipheret and Shekinah gives 
    birth to the human soul, and the mystical journey begins with the awareness 
    of this spiritual fact. Shekinah (A manifestation of The Divine Feminine Principle), 
    is the opening to this realization. One who enters must enter through this 
    gate. Once inside, the Sefirot are no longer an abstract theological system; 
    they become a map of consciousness. The mystic climbs and probes, discovering 
    dimensions of being. Spiritual and psychological wholeness is achieved by 
    meditating on the qualities of each sefirah, by imitating and integrating 
    the attributes of God. 'When you cleave to the Sefirot, the Divine Holy Spirit 
    enters into you, into every sensation, and every movement </font>(and, into 
    every insight to spiritual reality)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.'&quot;

<p align="center"><font size="+1">A review of <i>Perfect Symmetry, A Search For 
  the Beginning of Time</i>, by Heinz R. Pagels</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">By David M. Schramm</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;LESS THAN A DECADE AGO, QUESTIONS 
    ADDRESSED IN PHYSICS TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE REALM OF PHILOSOPHY OR THEOLOGY.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the Beginning was nothing, 
    and then there was symmetry. This led to inflation and broken symmetry, so 
    that the universe as we know it could begin to exist. Not quite Genesis, but 
    nevertheless a fine creation event. Our knowledge of the birth of the universe 
    has increased enormously in the past decade, ever since the Big Bang theory 
    became firmly established. We have observations of the background radiation 
    left over from the time when the universe was hot and dense. In addition it 
    has been shown that the nuclear reactions that occurred when the universe 
    was hot enough to be a giant thermonuclear reactor, produced helium, deuterium 
    and lithium in amounts that exactly agree with what extrapolations from astronomical 
    observations tell us they should be. Thus, the precise thermonuclear conditions 
    of the early universe--as early as one second after creation--are well established.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The description of the Big Bang, 
    from one second through three minutes (when the helium was formed), was popularly 
    described in 1977 in Steven Weinberg's well-known book, 'The First Three Minutes.' 
    Since 1977 the field has driven closer and closer to the creation event itself. 
    By current standards, three minutes is now relatively late in the history 
    of the universe. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ability to tackle questions 
    about the earliest times comes from the symbiosis between astrophysics, which 
    studies the very large, and elementary particle physics, which studies the 
    very small. The relationship between the two disciplines is often called the 
    inner-space and outer-space connection. (The earlier in the development of 
    the universe the higher the temperature of the environment and thus the higher 
    the energy of the physical processes that control the situation. High energy 
    physics involves the study of elementary particles at the world's largest 
    accelerators, like Fermilab in Illinois, CERN in Geneva, SLAC at Palo Alto, 
    Calif., and, it is hoped, at the proposed Superconducting Super Collider (S.S.C.) 
    in the United States.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In effect, these accelerators duplicate 
    the conditions of the very early universe. CERN is now reaching conditions 
    at 0.0000000001 seconds, and the S.S.C. should push this back by another factor 
    of 100.000. From the studies at CERN, it is known that forces such as gravity, 
    the nuclear strong interaction, the nuclear weak interaction, and the electromagnetic 
    interaction, seem to become united at higher energies. In other words, the 
    different forces we observe in our present low-energy world have their symmetry 
    restored at high energy, even though this symmetry is 'broken' in today's 
    world. The expected energy of the ultimate restoration of all symmetry is 
    well beyond the capabilities of even the S.S.C.. In fact, a true total unification 
    accelerator would stretch all the way to the center of our galaxy and is thus 
    a bit outside current funding limits. However, the early universe probably 
    went through just such energetic conditions as would be produced in such an 
    accelerator. It may have been that this moment of total unification and perfect 
    symmetry is what produced the cosmic inflation, the initial, very rapid expansion 
    of the universe, which set the initial conditions for the Big Bang.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To reconstruct what occurred during 
    the first moments takes both the ability to extrapolate particle accelerator 
    results to higher and higher energies and the ability to look at the debris 
    (galaxies, stars, people) left over from the Big Bang. New breakthroughs in 
    either discipline now stimulate the other. Cosmology now makes predictions 
    about what should be seen in accelerator experiments , and new accelerator 
    results help answer longstanding cosmological questions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Less than a decade ago, the kinds 
    of questions that are addressed in physics today would have been considered 
    in the realm of philosophy or theology. While we may not have the complete 
    answers, we can at least ask scientifically meaningful questions and perhaps 
    even expect answers within our lifetimes. Cosmology is no longer in the realm 
    of the mystical; it has become a science that is approachable, at least in 
    part, with the experimental method.&quot;</font></p>

  LEAP: QUANTUM PHYSICS TO THEOLOGY</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">STAR ISLAND, N.H.__Some 235 scientists, 
    engineers, philosophers, clergy, religious scholars and just plain folks spent 
    a week recently on this small island in the Atlantic Ocean 10 miles off the 
    coast of Portsmouth, N.H. They explored concepts of cosmology in physics and 
    Oriental religion, between which some people claim to see a relationship.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scientists have treaded more boldly 
    in the past decades beyond the physical to the metaphysical, as they push 
    to the edges of creation in an attempt to understand the universe. Some of 
    the questions they ask sound remarkably like those philosophers and theologians 
    have asked for millennia.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The question whether a commonality 
    actually exists between religious and physical concepts was guaranteed to 
    create a row--although one couched in the polite language of intellectual 
    disputation. The conference theme was the idea of nuclear physicist Lawrence 
    W. Fagg, a past vice-president of the sponsoring Institute of Religion in 
    an Age of Science. The 35-year old group wants to end the ideological war 
    between religion and science.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dramatic advances in quantum mechanics 
    have led to new concepts of how the universe began, said Fagg, research professor 
    of Nuclear Physics at Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said he is struck by parallels 
    between concepts physicists advance, often in poetical and metaphorical language, 
    and religious descriptions of time, space, the beginning of the cosmos, and 
    &quot;ultimate reality.&quot; Fagg said, &quot;Early religious mystics saw 
    there was a beginning, often involving light emission, thousands of years 
    before anyone heard of the big-bang theory.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scientists have drawn a picture 
    of the universe to within a trillionth of a second of the big-bang, the cosmic 
    explosion they say brought into existence all that is, including time and 
    space. But what was there before the big-bang? Some scientists say such a 
    question cannot be asked or answered. But some speculate a &quot;quantum foam&quot; 
    produced a bubble that expanded into a universe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fagg wonders whether the foam is 
    related to the Hindu's timeless Brahman, the Chinese Tao or to St. John's 
    Gospel: &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and 
    the Word was God.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are other possible connections: 
    What about the Buddhist idea that everything is in constant flux and part 
    of an interconnected but ineffable whole, a network of relations that extend 
    beyond space and time? And what about the Hindu notion of cyclical time--that 
    the universe dissolves and renews itself in another form? Can any insight 
    be applied from that to the scientific puzzle over whether the physical universe 
    is bound to collapse into itself--the big crunch--or expand to infinity and 
    die with a wimper?</font></p>

  ability to ultimately perceive God where the world only perceives nature. (And, 
  of course, the question will follow: Just who is a true Hebrew? And even a true 
  Jew? The answer is that the day shall declare it). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Despite its singular propensity for apostasy, and its attraction 
  to the Darkness (but only because it has been sent in this direction, and because 
  it has been set quite paradoxically free to commit such great transgressions), 
  the Hebrew soul is one who is also "passing over:" from its old nature to a 
  new; from Darwin's world to the realm of Love; from this age to the next; and 
  from the material realm to the spiritual. A Hebrew is one who, while considering 
  the nature of all things, makes the quantum leap across the expanse that divides 
  the logic of the lower world from the logic of the higher world. Moses called 
  this narrow expanse--this point, or moments in time and space--the Firmament. 
  (Genesis 1:6-8). The Qur'an calls it <i>The Place Where the Two Seas Meet.</i> 
  (Sura 55:17-21). In the East it is understood in the concept of <i>Nirvana</i>. 
  Paul calls it the place where things are spiritually discerned. (1 Corinthians 
  2:1-16).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In fact, long before Einstein conceptualized the hidden, fourth 
  dimension of reality in the twentieth century, Paul had already asked us to 
  consider it. He discovered it while considering the nature of God's invisible 
  Presence in the elements of nature itself, in the very fabric of Time and Space. 
  And then confirmed it to himself by studying the dimensions of the Mystery of 
  Christ as they revealed themselves on the limbs of the sacred Oracle, the Tree 
  of Life:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, 
    being Rooted and Grounded in love,</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the 
    breadth, and length, and depth, AND HEIGHT</font></i><i><font size="+1">... 
    </font></i><font size="+1">(Ephesians 3:17,18).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Just as Einstein's Fourth dimension, the space-time continuum 
  (Paul's "Height"), cannot be perceived normally with the physical senses, but 
  only with the mind (with the help of stories and graphs, and mathematical equations), 
  likewise, Paul is saying that if we are to comprehend and interpret the meaning 
  of the Universal Mystery of Christ, as they in the first-century were able to 
  (and as it appeared later in literary form in the Gospels), we must learn to 
  elevate our thoughts. We must learn to cease thinking in purely literal and 
  physical terms. (And yes, to quit fighting and arguing with each other over 
  literal meanings--as if anyone actually knew what they were talking about…Isaiah 
  29:10-12). We must transcend both apparent reality and literal meanings. This 
  is the lesson of twentieth-century physics. It teaches us how to read the scriptures, 
  and is what Paul meant when he wrote: <i>For the invisible things of God from 
  the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that 
  are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they </i>(the religious, 
  scientific and political rulers of this world)<i> are without excuse.</i>..(Romans 
  1:20). To fully comprehend the Christ Mystery one must be able to think in at 
  least Fourth dimensional terms. One must be able to perceive the Presence of 
  God risen up now in the sum of every unfolding human event.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(Without getting too far ahead of ourselves, this seems to 
  be the place to offer an interpretation of the verse at John 1:14: <i>And the 
  Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.</i> It is a paraphrase in the collective 
  sense, according to the dictates of the oracles, of those words which were also 
  written by Paul, forty years or more beforehand, which say: <i>Therefore what 
  agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living 
  God; As God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them. And I will be 
  their God and they will be my people.</i>..(2 Corinthians 6:16; Leviticus 26:11,12). 
  In other words, what Paul in this case expresses clearly (that God dwells in 
  every being) the author of the Book of John, using Paul's doctrine of Christ 
  as a source of his own theological reasonings, says cryptically. They are both, 
  however, saying the same thing: that the Word of God did not become flesh in 
  one individual alone, but rather in the entire Body of Humanity together, and 
  more particularly in the entire Body of every individual who has ever entered 
  into this great Circle of the Mystery of Christ, from the time of Christ to 
  this time. (See 1 Corinthians 12:12-14). And then, even more specifically in 
  these times, in every one who is coming to perfection in this same Mystery here 
  at this Western end of the earth, as it is written: <i>From the rising of the 
  Sun </i>(in the East)<i>, to the going down of the same </i>(in the West)<i>...</i>(Malachi 
  1:11). We speak to the meaning of it all in the following chapters).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The center of the mandala is the moment of Creation. Science 
  has come to call it the Big Bang. We shall call it the First, or Great, Emanation. 
  The infinitesimal point at its center, the Navel of Reality itself, is the point 
  at which the singular Consciousness of God touches and reaches out into the 
  phenomenal universe. It is from where the forces and dimensions that convey 
  the Presence of the Mind of God emanated into the material realm. It is the 
  point at which Pure Thought transformed itself into what we call matter (E=mc2). 
  It happened at the moment of Creation. It happens in the conception of every 
  human child.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The point at the center is immediately an emerging or expanding 
  circle, or sphere (and eventually some immense universal form that science can 
  only speculate about at the moment), representing not merely the most fundamental 
  structure of the universe, but the singular Nature of God from which all other 
  forms in the universe emerged, of which the gravitational force is an agent, 
  or a representative in time. The primal, fiery circle immediately broke, like 
  cells dividing, into the emerging, and descending atomic structure (from the 
  lightest elements over time to the heaviest), carrying the Image of the Presence 
  of God into all the quarters of the (still) expanding universe, and finally 
  into the formation of this Solar system and the planet Earth.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The circle (sphere) has certain 
    properties which set it apart from all other forms: it has no beginning and 
    no end. Every point in its circumference is equidistant from its center, and 
    its circumference considered as linear distance encloses a maximum area. It, 
    like the point, represents unified perfection, and therefore infinity (like 
    the number for pi), and eternity, and Deity. The circle emblematizes the conceptual 
    world. In contrast to the circle, the square is the number four, which in 
    turn represents the physical universe, because a minimum of four points is 
    required for three-dimensional extension. Any attempt to change a circle to 
    a square therefore involves reducing the infinite to the finite, and involves 
    transmuting the Divine to the physical.&quot; </font>Touches of Sweet Harmony,

<p><font size="+1">Herman Minkowski, a contemporary of Einstein's, made use of 
  the two two-dimensional diagrams (<a href="../UsedImages/pg06.GIF">presented 
  above</a>) in order to express the relationship between the phenomenon of light 
  and Einstein's four-dimensional space-time continuum. He outlined two vectors 
  from the moment of creation expressing the dimensions of both time and space, 
  which are as intricately connected to each other as the electro-magnetic force 
  (light) is to itself. The world had discovered by then that light travels through 
  space at 186,000 miles a second. By connecting these two points on the diagram 
  to each other, and then by projecting a mathematical ray of light across the 
  field of this equation, we see that the light ray must immediately assume a 
  45 degree (or 90 degree) relationship to the two-dimensional idea of time and 
  space. (Please see that in this equation we also have the geometry of the world-pyramid 
  when viewed from above, and, as we are discovering, the form of the Mystery 
  of Christ as it presented itself to the adepts of the hidden sciences on the 
  limbs of the Cosmic Tree. (John 1:1-8).</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg138a.gif" width="527" height="237"></p>
<p><font size="+1">At the same time Science was also discovering that, just as 
  a small image of the moment of creation was carried away by every single atom 
  in the expanding universe, so light itself is continually born and re-born (as 
  it were) as the energy of the universe transforms itself, as it is emitted from 
  the atomic center of great fiery stars--our own Sun in particular--and then 
  as it is absorbed and re-emitted by every other atom that it touches on earth. 
  (Please begin to see how the mechanics of the universe are a macrocosmic reflection 
  of the process of human spiritual development...2 Corinthians 4:6; Matthew 5:14-16; 
  John 3:3, 19-21).</font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">Likewise, the world was also discovering that time itself was 
  not a continuous entity. It does not flow as it appears to, without interruption, 
  as a stream running down to the sea. But it is rather like the pebbles that 
  line the stream bed. Time, and therefore reality itself, is <a href="SideLinks/ThePlanckUnit.htm">quantum 
  in nature</a>. It exists for an infinitesimally small fraction of a fraction 
  of a second, and then it ceases to exist for approximately the same fraction 
  of a second (according to certain principles of expansion and contraction). 
  The universe is flashing on and off, creating and uncreating itself millions 
  of times a second. We cannot see it because it is happening too fast.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Seeing both time and light emanating from the central point 
  of the mandala (which now also represents every mathematical point in the material 
  universe, and every conceptual point in the human mind) we can, with Minkowski, 
  divide the diagram into three metaphysical areas that accurately reflect the 
  nature of time-space and light, and the relationship between them: the Future 
  (which most assuredly exists in the construct of our own human understanding), 
  the Past, and the Ever-present-moment. Humanity's future is defined by every 
  place in the universe (both here on earth and in the material heavens above) 
  upon which the light shines, or from which light emanates. If man can see it 
  he can travel there--provided he has enough Time. If he cannot see it he cannot 
  travel there, at least not in his own physical form. One cannot see with their 
  own physical senses into the darkened, other-dimensional area on the diagram, 
  because in order to do so we would have to get light to travel faster than itself, 
  to cover more distance or to reveal more of space in less time. (Some physicists 
  have recently claimed that they were able to induce matter to move at speeds 
  faster than light. There is evidence for it elsewhere as well. If they could 
  capture the moment in which it happens in a wide-enough array of images, then 
  perhaps they could also see into the other world. Nature is teasing them though...And 
  yet, some future communication system between the two worlds, or two universes, 
  comes immediately to mind)...</font></p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the material light not only defines humanity's future 
  in the material realm, but because of the impossibility of attaining to it in 
  the physical form, the speed of light confines man to the natural, material 
  realm. He cannot, in his natural form (or in his natural state of mind), get 
  across. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But reality is, as it is said, stranger than fiction. Where 
  is the Future? It does not exist in the material realm at all. Nothing exists 
  but the Ever-present-moment. And the Ever-present-moment is only as expansive 
  as the smallest flick, or particle of time. The reality is that we all exist 
  at the center of a vast Four-dimensional--actually Ten-dimensional--hologram 
  of sorts, a Masterful Illusion created and sustained by the Mind of God itself. 
  To see it with the mind's eye one must stop time for that fraction of a second…STOP! 
  Now where is the Future? It does not exist yet. Where is it? It is still in 
  the Mind of God. It is the next fraction of a second away. It is about to appear, 
  but it is not here yet. Where is the Past? It is gone. It disappeared the last 
  fraction of a second ago. Where did it go? It is in the mind of man. It is stored 
  in Divine Images in the recesses of the human psyche. And in the process we 
  see immediately that the Past is not the cause of the Future, but that the Future 
  is the cause of the Past, and that everything that is unfolding in the earth 
  before our eyes is emanating directly from the Mind of God.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg10.gif" width="496" height="300"></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the upper triangle in Minkowski's equation represents 
  just that: the Mind of God, as well as the heavens above, while the lower represents 
  the mind of humanity, and the world below. Where these two symbols come together 
  in the Mystery of the Universal Christ (at the Navel of the Great Mandala), 
  and when they merge and are joined together, they represent not only a true 
  state of prophetic vision, but the true, holy, and universal Nation--the very 
  Nation that has preserved, and carried this Universal Vision back to this Western 
  end of the earth and this fullness of time. Of course, upon arriving here, we 
  must not imagine that the gift of sight was, or is the exclusive property of 
  any one particular people alone. Universal Israel is a much more inclusive and 
  greater reality than either Jews or Christians have understood: </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">These words become increasingly meaningful as we continue to 
  interpret the Scriptures in light of the events of the 20th century, and when 
  it is seen exactly where on earth we are going to place this point that separates 
  human comprehension from the Mind of God. For the moment we will leave it at 
  the center of the Oracle, at the place named Tipheret, or Beauty--keeping in 
  mind the words, however:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">But first, without going into a long discussion here on the 
  relationship, or the analogy, that exists between such exotic phenomena as black 
  holes in outerspace (which are required as a mathematical function of Einstein's 
  discussion on the nature and behavior of time in a gravitational field), and 
  the pathway the perfected human mind takes across the dimensions of inner space 
  (its own inner space), which leads from this world to the next upon the death 
  of the body, please consider again Minkowski's inclusion of that other dimension, 
  that other world which he labeled <i>Elsewhere</i>. This Elsewhere is the Parallel 
  Universe. It is right here, traveling along, living and breathing, and pulsating 
  in quantum rhythm in the very same space as the world we inhabit. It exists 
  in the same space, but in a different dimension of time. When it is flashing 
  on, ours is flashing off. When it is off we are on. (-) (+) (-) (+) (-) (+) 
  (-). The mind that can see it (even though the eyes cannot), and who knows the 
  Way, can get there. (John 14:4-6). And we know this universe exists because 
  of the words: <i>Male and Female created He them...</i>(Genesis 1:27).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Please consider <i>The Holographic Universe</i>, by Michael 
  Talbot, but certainly the sub-chapter entitled <a href="SideLinks/Consciousness.htm">Matter 
  and Consciousness</a> in the Addendum to this work before returning here to 
  take another step toward understanding the relationship that exists between 
  the Oracle--The Universal Tree of Life--and a perhaps even deeper set of quantum 
  realities: the idea of metempsychosis, or the transmigration of certain souls 
  from one place in time to another. In the meantime please continue to see that 
  the Four-dimensional Mandala on the Tree of Life is set in a framework, not 
  only of <a href="../UsedImages/pg119.center.web.gif">Ten dimensions</a> but 
  of our already-familiar Ten Sefiroth, or Ten Aeons, or Ten Manifestations of 
  Divine Reality).</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus it was no surprise, given the realization that as the 
  universe was found to be expanding in all directions (toward some ultimate cosmic 
  form), and, of course, human consciousness along with it, that Einstein's four 
  dimensions were soon found to be insufficient to explain what is really going 
  on in the mind of nature (the Mind of God that is). The mathematics of four 
  dimensions did not coincide, or equate, with the continuing discoveries in the 
  field of quantum physics (with those things discovered to be going on deep inside 
  the recesses of the atomic structure). Other dimensions were needed to satisfy 
  the equation between the very large and the very small, and also to satisfy 
  the intellectual desire for simplicity and symmetry in the created order. A 
  total of Ten dimensions has satisfied the equation. (Some reason eleven. But 
  that coincides with the presence of that other illusive sefira named <i>Da'at</i>, 
  of which we shall speak in a while). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the meantime we will leave you to Michio Kaku's work entitled, 
  <i>Hyperspace, A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, 
  and the Tenth Dimension</i>. It rises above many of the other popular works 
  on this subject in that its language, as well as its logic, coincides with that 
  of the Oracle. On the cover we find the <a href="../UsedImages/Hyperspace.gif">picture 
  of a Cube</a> descending from heaven (or suspended in mid-air). The image has 
  everything to do with the cubic form that is descending out of the Mind of God 
  into human consciousness at Revelation 21:16. Without fully realizing (I presume) 
  the further relationship that exists between this Six-sided geometrical form 
  and the place named Beauty (and numbered Six on the Tree of Life), in a chapter 
  entitled &quot;Signals From the Tenth Dimension&quot;, he wonders: &quot;Is 
  Beauty a physical principle?&quot; And when describing the theory of Ten dimensions, 
  explaining how six of these ten never appeared in an expanded or expanding form 
  as the other four, but remained concealed (not only within the almost purely 
  spiritual domain of the atomic structure, but, as we shall see, at the center 
  of the Oracle itself), he does so under the heading: "Compactification and Beauty." 
  Something, or perhaps more appropriately, someone, is considered beautiful because 
  all their parts fit together, in proportion, complimenting each other in the 
  most eye-pleasing way (to the beholder of course). Thus the center of the Oracle 
  is named Beauty for the same reason, because all of the parts of the world-puzzle 
  will begin to fit together there, and compliment each other, without forcing 
  or disfiguring them. They will fit there because they emanated from there, and 
  because all things must return to their original source.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Ten dimensions of reality (as they reveal themselves in 
  the field of theoretical physics, and in the corresponding dimensions of the 
  Cosmic World Tree, and as they work together with, and exert their influences 
  on the virtually invisible space-time continuum in which all of us reside) allow 
  us to reason the existence of the other worlds spoken of in the Kabbalah. These 
  are the descending worlds of Emanation, Creation (one dimension), Formation 
  (two dimensions), and Action (three dimensions). The last world, the world of 
  Action, is the one that is apparent to our physical senses. Not only do these 
  higher worlds, as well as the Fifth descending world (the world of pure abstract, 
  Christ-Conscious thought), yield themselves to our intellectual and spiritual 
  senses, they allow us to reason both the supernal and infernal aspects of the 
  world in which we live--the higher, supernal realm of the East, and the lower, 
  infernal realm of the West. They also allow us to find our way through the Doorway 
  of this Universe into the Pure Land of the world beyond. </font></p>
