<p align="center"><font size="+1">THAT THEY MAY BE CALLED TREES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS...(Isaiah 
  61:3). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In all of the following pages of this work, interpretations 
  will be based on the many various Faces, or transformations of the Sacred Oracle 
  (the Tree of Life), several of which follow here on this page. For those of 
  you dear readers who are not already familiar with the doctrines of Kabbalah, 
  or with the basic structure of the Tree of Life, we simply suggest that you 
  push on until it becomes familiar to you. Please be assured in your journey 
  that this symbol of the Universal World Tree as it is sometimes called, is a 
  very ancient one, and that the ideas ensouled and embodied in it have been passed 
  down through hundreds and hundreds of generations, literally from the time of 
  Adam to our own, and from one end of the earth to the other. (Psalm 19:1-6)...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;(FOR THESE THOU HAST PLANTED 
    A TREE) which blooms with flowers unfading, whose boughs put forth thick leaves, 
    which stands firm-planted for ever, and gives shade to all...(whose branches 
    tower) to heaven, whose roots sink down to the abyss.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the rivers of Eden water its 
    boughs; it thrives beyond (all bounds), (burgeons beyond all) measure. (Its 
    branches stretch) endless across the world, and (its roots go down) to the 
    nethermost realm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, there shall well forth 
    for them a fountain of Light, a perpetual spring unfailing. Howbeit, in its 
    (fiery) sparks all (infamous) men shall be burned; it shall be a flame devouring 
    the guilty, until they are destroyed.&quot;</font><b> </b>The Book of Hymns, 
    The Dead Sea Scriptures, by Theodor Gaster, p.168<b>.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> It is our intention here to access these ideas (if Heaven 
  allows...It does), in the hope of gaining an interpretation of the things that 
  are unfolding in the world around us in our own time. (For those of you who 
  are storming the gates of Caesar's new global order, trying to bring them down, 
  please continue in your efforts. But also be aware that God is rising up everywhere 
  in the world to assist you. And just as you can not accomplish your ends without 
  God's great assistance, you can not begin to understand the things that are 
  happening in the world around you without access to God's oracles. God, in essence 
  already part of the action, wants to be part of the conversation). We must soon 
  awaken to the meaning of those things that are unfolding in the Earth, realize 
  that we must eventually stop trying to change this present political order (it 
  is impervious to change), stop investing it with our energies, come out of it 
  and begin to create anew. All things are ready...Revelation, chapter 18...KJV).

<p><font size="+1">In addition to the seminal works of Gershom Scholem and the 
  scholarship of A. E. Waite (<i>The Holy Kabbalah, A Study of the Secret Tradition 
  in Israel...</i>), there are some very excellent introductions to the subject 
  of the Tree of Life in print, and of easy access. Among them are Daniel C. Matt's 
  <i>The Essential Kabbalah</i>, and Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi's <i>Adam and the 
  Kabbalistic Tree</i>, but I would recommend <i>Heavenly Powers, Unraveling the 
  Secret History of the Kabbalah</i>, by Neil Asher Silberman.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those familiar with 
    the doctrines of the Kabbalah, and with the corresponding structure of the 
    Tree of Life, will immediately notice that the Left and Right arms of the 
    Christ-figure (which is not to be perceived literally) are not connected to 
    what should be considered the Left and Right sides of the Oracle. It is not 
    the Christ-figure that must be turned around, or juxtaposed however, but the 
    structure of the Tree of Life. This, so that the Left Arm is situated in its 
    appropriate place on the Lefthand Pillar, which extends from Hokhmah (Wisdom) 
    through Hesed (Love, or Mercy) to Netsah (Endurance or Victory); and the Right 
    Arm on that side which extends from Binah (Understanding) through Din (Power), 
    (and sometimes called Geburah, Severity, or Judgment) to Hod (Majesty or Glory).</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This correction 
    must be made to compensate for the realization that in the &quot;letter&quot; 
    of the Torah God placed His hand over the eyes of Israel and showed them His 
    back parts only. (Exodus 33:11-23). While in the Spirit of Revelation two 
    thousand years ago the Angel of Divine Presence appeared to them, as He did 
    to Moses, Face to Face. (Malachi 3:1-3; Matthew 11:10); (1 Corinthians 13:11,12); 
    (Revelation 6:16; Rev.10:1; Rev.22:4).</font></p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">&quot;Man is the measure of all things&quot; only insofar 
      as he reflects the principles inherent in the Celestial Man of Light, who, 
      in turn, is a reflection of God. (Please see Ezekiel 1:5). The proportions 
      of the human body reflect these principles in an admirable fashion, and 
      in the above illustration the kabballistic sephira are shown in their correct 
      position, while the four circles correspond to the elemental continuum of 
      Greek cosmology. The lower three circles relate to the Pythagorean and Platonic 
      division of the soul, the three worlds in man. As Plato observes in <i>The 
      Republic, </i>true self mastery is obtained by &quot;bringing into tune 
      those three parts, like the terms in the proportion of a musical scale, 
      the highest and lowest notes and the means between them with all the intermediate 
      intervals.&quot; In traditional cosmology, humanity actualizes this function 
      of mediation on a universal level, binding together intelligible and sensible, 
      eternal and temporal, Mind and matter.</p>

        <p align="center"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God put Three 
          Powers into the world for us to use. We need them all. We Indians know 
          all three. It took us a million years to find them.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's the 
          Material power, the Spiritual power, and the Supernatural power. The 
          material power is the goodness of this Earth. The spiritual power is 
          the goodness of human beings. The supernatural power is the goodness 
          of God, the Great Spirit. The Three powers are all separate. They're 
          not connected. It's the job of human beings to make that connection.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We connect 
          the Three Powers with our prayers, with our ceremonies, with our deeds. 
          Every good deed is a pillar of the Creation. Every prayer holds up the

        to submit not only to the oracles of God, but to each other in particular, 
        each individual and each family (from every direction of human consciousness, 
        West, South, East, and North) stands in harmony with every other. On any 
        particular day souls from Three directions sit at the feet of those from 
        the Fourth, to discover the Wisdom of God that comes from that direction. 
        On the next day another Three sit at the feet of another Fourth, to learn 
        the Wisdom that springs forth from that direction. The circle is complete 
        when all have sat at the feet of every other, and when the Wisdom of God
