<p><font size="+1">This <i>remnant</i> in our time (assembled around the Left 
  Foot of the Mystery of Christ at the place named Endurance) are those who, in 
  the spirit of the true Christ, are not kneeling to any of the idols of the American 
  nation. They are the first to comprehend the nature of those powers God has 
  raised up in the world in these last days to deliver the people from the antichrists 
  of the earth. They fill up the symbolic number of Seven thousand. Having overcome 
  the Darkness of this age, the illusions of this world, and the doubts and fears 
  that grip the unperfected mind, they are prepared to lay down their own lives 
  in the Mystery of Christ, just as those who lived in the time of John the Baptist 
  were called upon to do. Those in that time were a morning sacrifice, these are 
  an evening sacrifice. (See Exodus 29:38,39; Numbers 28:1-8). Having died the 
  <i>First Death</i>--the death of their old natures, and their old earthly view 
  of reality--they arrive at the end of this age fulfilling the words: <i>The 
  path of the just is as a shining light that shineth more and more unto a Perfect 
  day. </i>(Proverbs 4:18). They fulfill the words which say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Blessed and holy are they that have part in the First 
    Resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests 
    of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(not

    20:4-6).</font></p>

  shall wage the greater holy war against the spirit of Antichrist in the world--against 
  America's continued attempts to conscript the mind of Israel, especially now 
  as the final judgments of God begin to unfold:</font></p>
<blockquote>

  side--for every perfected soul has its own male or female counterpart in the 
  universe, and this state of balance, this quest for wholeness, for true love, 
  is the driving force in all spiritual relationships--but rather, it refers to 
  the realization that this remnant shall not be alive on this earth as the Nation-church 
  rises up and is joined to God's Anointed Ones (Zechariah 3:8 to 4:14). They 
  will not be here to partake in the marriage between the people and the Messiah(s)

    to describe or even relate from mouth to mouth. But as I returned to the lower 
    garden of Eden I saw many souls, both of the living and of the dead, those 
    known to me and those unknown. There were more than could be counted and they 
    ran to and fro from world to world through the path provided by that column 
    known to the adepts of the hidden science. They were all in such a state of 
    GREAT RAPTURE, that the mouth would be worn out if it attempted to describe

<p><font size="+1">The following is from the Introduction to the Dead Sea Scriptures, 
  by Theodor H. Gaster:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are introduced in these 
    writings (The Dead Sea Scrolls) to a community which is conceived as the true 
    and ideal Congregation of Israel, THE SMALL REMNANT that has stayed faithful 
    to the traditional Covenant and that is thereby ensuring the continuance of 
    God's people and the eventual cleansing of His land from the stain of guilt. 
    The Covenant, it is held, has been maintained by a succession of such pious 
    'remnants.' </font>(Likewise, from the time of Christ to our own)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The members of the community conceived 
    of themselves as repeating in a later age the experience of their remote forefathers 
    (and mothers) in the days of Moses. When they leave the cities and villages 
    and repair to the desert, they picture themselves as going out into the wilderness 
    to receive a new Covenant. What is envisaged, however, is no 'New Testament' 
    in the Christian sense of the term, no abrogation or substitution of the old 
    Covenant, but simply a new affirmation of it. </font>(See Matthew 5:17-19)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    This is in accordance with the traditional Jewish view that the eternal Covenant 
    is periodically reaffirmed and that the Pact concluded at Sinai was itself 
    but a re-articulation of that which God had previously made, in their several 
    generations, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To emphasize this basic idea and 
    to bring out more clearly its sense of continuity with previous 'remnants,' 
    the community is designated in the Scrolls by a series of titles...with significant 
    historical associations. It is described...as 'the elect' or 'rightfully chosen.' 
    in reference especially to the election of Israel at Mount Sinai. Its priests 
    are called 'the sons of Zadok,' in reference to the foremost priestly family 
    in the time of David (cf. 2 Samuel 8:17) and to those whom the prophet Ezekiel 
    had designated, in his visions of the future restored Temple, as the only 
    legitimate priests (Ezek. 40:46; 43:19; 44:15; 48:11). Its sojourn in the 
    forbidding desert is portrayed as exile in 'the wilderness of Damascus,' thereby 
    dramatizing it as the fulfillment of the prophet Amos' prediction that God 
    would cause His people to go into exile beyond Damascus' (Amos 5:27)...</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...And it regards itself as 
        the militia of God--a kind of Salvation Army--ready, like its ancestors 
        under Moses and Joshua, to do battle for His name and to drive out the 
        heathen from His land--in this case, from the whole earth (...It even 
        drew up an elaborate plan of campaign for 'Armageddon).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is, however, one critical 
        difference between this community and its remote prototype: it is not 
        waiting to receive the Law; it already possesses it. Its aim is simply 
        to assert that Law, to deliver it from the realm of darkness in which 
        it had become engulfed. The Torah--that is, the Divine Teaching (or Guidance) 
        as revealed to Moses--has, it is held, been successively garbled and perverted 
        by 'fallen expositors.' </font>(See Hebrews 6, and 2 Peter 2)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
        The community's main purpose is to exemplify and promulgate the true interpretation. 
        It bases that interpretation on a kind of 'apostolic succession,' begun 
        by the prophets and continued by a series of inspired leaders, each of 
        whom is known as 'the correct expositor,' or 'right teacher'...that is, 
        the orthodox expounder of the Word. The 'right teacher' was probably in 
        every case a priest, his title being being derived from Moses' farewell 
        blessing upon the priestly tribe of Levi: 'They have observed Thy word 
        and kept Thy covenant. They shall <i>teach</i> Jacob Thine ordinances, 
        and Israel Thy Law. (Deuteronomy 33:9-10).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just as Israel has been led 
        of old by these prophets and teachers, so, it is held, a new Prophet and 
        a new Teacher (perhaps one and the same person) will arise at the end 
        of the present era to usher in the Golden Age, when the scattered hosts 
        of Israel will be gathered in, a duly anointed high priest and a duly 
        anointed king (the Messiahs anointed of Aaron and Israel) installed, and 
        'the earth filled with the knowledge of the Lord like the waters which 
        covered the sea.' The concept is derived directly from the words of Moses 
        in Deuteronomy 18:15-18: 'The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet 
        from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall 
        hearken...The Lord hath said unto me...'I will raise them up a prophet 
        from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in 
        his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.'...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But even if the Torah be correctly 
        expounded by a prophet and teacher, men, it is held, can and will receive 
        it only if they be correctly attuned. And that attunement comes--if we 
        may mix the metaphor--through inner 'enlightenment.' The community considers 
        itself, therefore, not only the remnant of Israel but also the specially 
        'enlightened.' </font>(See 2 Corinthians 4:1-6)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
        Over and over again in the <i>Book of Hymns</i> thanks are rendered to 
        God for 'illuminating the face' of His servants or for shining His light 
        in His servant's hearts. The acquisition of that light, however, is not 
        attributed to any sudden spontaneous act of grace </font>(of course, it 
        is...by those who are enlightened)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
        Rather is it the result of man's own voluntary exercise of that power 
        of discernment which God placed in every creature at the moment of creation. 
        </font>(Genesis 1:16,17; Leviticus 1:1-3)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
        All things, it is affirmed--even the sun and moon and stars--have been 
        endowed by God with sensate knowledge, though the choice of using it or 
        ignoring it has been left, in the case of man, to his individual will. 
        </font>(This is not entirely true. One cannot exercise that will unless 
        it is energized by the Spirit...Romans 8:11-30...KJV)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
        If he heeds the gift, he achieves harmony with the eternal cosmic scheme 
        and breaks the trammels of his mortality </font>(this is true)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
        Automatically, he is embraced in the communion of eternal things; he becomes 
        one with the non-mortal beings of the celestial realm--the 'holy ones' 
        who stand forever in direct converse with God.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is this state that the members 
        of the Qumran Community claim for themselves. This is the ultimate goal 
        of the entire spiritual adventure; the aim and <i>raison d'etre </i>of 
        the Torah and of the disciplined life which it enjoins. They hold that 
        by virtue of their 'enlightenment' they are members not only of a consecrated 
        earthly 'community' but <i>eo ipso</i> also of the Eternal Communion...</font></p>
      <p><i><font size="+1">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness 
        of the firmament: and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars 
        for ever and ever...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 12:3).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As one of their psalmists puts 
        it, they walk for ever 'in uplands unbounded' and know that 'there is 
        hope for all that is molded of clay to have converse with things everlasting.' 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is not, as all too many 
        scholars have supposed, a mere belief in bodily resurrection or a mere 
        hope for the survival of the soul in some cloudland of bliss. Rather is 
        it the sound mystic sense that, given the right spiritual posture, given 
        the victory over that darkness which is set before them along with the 
        light, man may live even on earth in a dimension of eternity.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">_____</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be a mistake to suppose 
        that writers of the Scrolls and the community of Qumran were inspired 
        only by recollection of things past or that they chose their way of life 
        simply because they were unsettled by political turbulence or disgusted 
        by the venality of the Jerusalemitan priests </font>(and now the American 
        religious establishment)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. They 
        were swept also by other winds. One of these was a widespread and well-attested 
        contemporary belief that the cycle of the ages was about to complete its 
        revolution. This belief was based on a conception, which can in fact be 
        traced to remote Indian antiquity, that existence consists not in linear 
        progressive development...but in constant cyclical repetition of primordial 
        and archetypal events. When major upheavals occurred, it was promptly 
        supposed that the cycle was nearing its end, that the Great Year was at 
        hand, and that cosmos was about to revert to chaos. The primordial elements, 
        restrained and regulated at the beginning of the world, would again be 
        unleashed; all things would dissolve in an overwhelming deluge </font>(of 
        war)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> or be burned in an everlasting 
        fire which rages in the depths of the earth </font>(at the depths of man's 
        soul)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. THEN THE CYCLE WOULD 
        BEGIN AGAIN; A NEW WORLD WOULD BE BROUGHT TO BIRTH...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The authors of the Scrolls 
        and the community of Qumran lived at a time of such 'cyclic crisis.' It 
        is writ large in the pseudepigraphic literature of the two centuries immediately 
        preceding the Common Era, and its fading echo may be heard in John the 
        Baptist's cry that 'the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.' It was escape from 
        the inexorable cycle, release not from sin but from mortality, that these 
        men were seeking. The desert to which the Dead Sea community repaired 
        was not simply the Desert of Judah; it was also the mystic's Desert of 
        Quitude--what John Tauler called 'the Wilderness of Godhead </font>(Ephesians 
        1:17-23; Colossians 1:12-20)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
        into which He leads all who are to receive the inspiration of God, now 
        or in eternity.' In that wilderness (of the nations), they would not merely 
        receive a renewal of the Covenant; they would also have the vision of 
        the Burning Bush. Removed from men, they would acquire an unobstructed 
        view of the divine. Thirsting in an inhospitable wild, they would drink 
        the unfailing waters of God's grace. Shorn of earthly possessions, theirs 
        would be the poverty of the mystics--that poverty which Evelyn Underhill 
        has described as 'complete detachment from all finite things.' Burned 
        by the scorching sun, they would see the <i>semplice lume</i> of Dante, 
        the 'infused brightness' of Saint Teresa, and by that light they would 
        not be dazzled. They would achieve an intimacy, a communion wit the eternal, 
        unchanging things, such as one can achieve only in a desert or on a sea. 
        And in this experience they would reproduce and concentrate within themselves 
        the drama of the cosmic circle, THE DISSOLVING OF THE OLD ORDER AND THE 
        BIRTH OF THE NEW. </font>The Dead Sea Scriptures, by Theodor H. Gaster,

<p><font size="+1">(40 years minus 38 years = 2 years old and under). While the 
  historical records do not tell of a pogrom against any particular group of pacifists, 
  or Essenes, in the time of this Herod---not until the appearance of John the 
  Baptist and the early Church some years later--this Herod was used by the authors 
  of the Gospels as the type of ruler who was, and still is, completely capable 
  of it. In addition to murdering many of his own family and acquaintances, as 
  his own death approached he ordered that all the leaders of the nation be locked 
  up in the hippodrome, and that they should all be executed upon notice of his 
  death, along with one member of every single family in his kingdom. (He wanted 
  to assure that the day he died would always be observed as a day of mourning). 
  The scriptural account of the slaughter of the innocents is an archetypal and 
  prophetic account, just as Herod is a type of those leaders (psychopaths one 
  and all--no matter whether they be Saddams, Sharons or Bushs), who slay others 
  and slaughter innocents. The <i>two years</i> symbolize the difference in age 
  between those men of war who were cleansed out of the camp of Israel and those--pacifists 
  one and all--who eventually inherited the promise. The text alludes not only 
  to the fate of those who contended for the true faith (the true meaning of the 
  Law) in those times, as well as throughout all other times since then, it also 
  speak of those who went passively to their deaths in the European Holocaust 
  (see Genesis 15:12, 13), as well as of all those who who must still fulfill 
  these words again in our own time, as it is written: <i>(They) were brought

    </font><i>Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your souls

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And the second is like it.&quot; 
    With these words, Jesus went beyond what his questioner wanted to know. He 
    told him too much. He told him that it was impossible to find the center of 
    God's revelation in a single commandment. The second is like it, and is forever 
    the partner of the first.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I suppose that one over-simplified 
    way to understand the pilgrimage of the church over the last century is to 
    see it as a struggle to keep the first and second commandment together. Our 
    culture is embarrassed by people with an unabashed devotion to God; but those 
    who have fervent devotion to neighbor are praised as saints of humanity. So, 
    again and again, the people of God have been confronted by various forms of 
    thought that change Jesus' words,</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">

    </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the social gospel of 
    decades past to some liberation theologies of the present, the temptation 
    has been to transmute the first commandment into the second. To love your 
    neighbor is to love God. Let us worry only about peace and justice among men; 
    God will take care of himself. By fulfilling the second commandment we will 
    necessarily fulfill the first. Or so they say.</font></p>
