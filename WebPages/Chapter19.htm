  <p align="center">MAN OF PEACE - CHILD OF LIGHT<br>
    By Judith Moriarty<br>
    NoahsHouse@adelphia.net</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p>It was February 2, 2001, and I had been invited to travel to Portland, 
      Maine, to attend the sentencing of 77 year old peace activist Philip Berrigan. 
      Philip did not deny that he and other demonstrators broke through a fence 
      at a Maryland Air National Guard base and damaged two A-10 Thunderbolts. 
      Berrigan said that the A-10 aircraft use armor-piercing ammunition that 
      contains depleted uranium which he believes is the source of Gulf War Syndrome 
      and the cause of numerous deaths and deformities of adults and children 
      in Iraq and in our soldiers. He told the judge, of comparable age, &quot;I 
      was acting according to my conscience and the precepts of non-violent principles 
      and laws&quot;. Berrigan was sentenced along with Susan Crane, 57, to a 
      year in Federal Prison. Would that he had been an Enron, Tyco, Worldcom, 
      etc., criminal; or had been involved in the billions of the Savings and 
      Loans heist (Neil Bush-Silvarado) he'd have been a free man.</p>
    <p> Philip Berrigan and members of Plowshares, had found weapons of mass destruction, 
      and symbolically went about destroying these annihilating weapons of mankind. 
      Phil would have been lauded, had he found them in Iraq, but here on American 
      soil, he was branded a criminal. Some weapons are more equal than others-it 
      all depends where they are found. <br>
      <br>
      It was a cold gray day. I'd never been to Portland, and gazed ever so briefly 
      at the blur of blues, greens and netting, of various seafood restaurants 
      and the choppy ocean waters beyond. There was a small band of supporters 
      outside the courthouse. I thought to myself, watching the great love they 
      had for one another, that the rest of the world would never see this grave 
      injustice being perpetuated against this man of Forever Peace. I'd never 
      met Philip Berrigan (though I read his books), and was quite taken with 
      his gentle, giant, demeanor and front porch welcoming smile, that invited 
      you into his life. <br>
      <br>
      His blue eyes sparkled with some private mischief and his white hair was 
      covered with a tweed cap. He seemed more intent on comforting his followers, 
      than being dragged off to prison that day. I spoke briefly with him, impressed 
      that he'd take the time. During the lunch break, the driver of the vehicle, 
      in which we'd made the trip and I, stopped into a hole in the wall coffee 
      shop. There at a table near the window, sat Philip, his &quot;friends&quot; 
      and brother Daniel, eating clam chowder. No lavish last meal this. We bought 
      coffee, and quickly left this small group to themselves, not wanting, as 
      strangers, to intrude in their last moments together. I was secretly envious 
      of the laughter, love, and peace that emanated from this band of peace activists. 
      People you would want to know. <br>
      <br>
      Confusing isn't it? The season identified as peace on earth to men of goodwill, 
      with war raging, and local farmers, loggers, and truckers being sent off 
      to this chaos for a year and a half! And so, for &quot;freedom-peace-liberation-regime 
      change&quot;, people of one land occupy another and kill and kill and kill. 
      The men who make all the money from this war business, count their loot, 
      buy stock, and vacation on the Riviera or exotic islands watching it all 
      from a distance. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;This is the rule of love: the good that we desire for ourselves we 
      desire for our neighbors also; and the evil that we are unwilling to undergo 
      we wish to prevent from happening to our neighbor. All who love God will 
      have such a desire toward everybody.&quot; (Augustine). We self-righteously 
      denounce those, who in the name of conscience, would try to save mankind 
      from the madness that has the very real potential to destroy us all. What 
      juries and judges perceived as lawbreaking, &quot;being a danger to the 
      community&quot;, Philip Berrigan and his fellow activists for peace, saw 
      as allegiance to international law and treaties forbidding nations to prepare 
      for wars of annihilation. In a 1996 autobiography, Philip writes, &quot;If 
      a house full of children is burning, it is necessary to break down the door 
      to rescue them. In our trials the government refused to allow the necessary 
      defense, arguing we could not prove that nuclear war was imminent. We explained 
      that nuclear war could happen at any time. It was imminent because the government 
      was designing, building and deploying nuclear weapons. It was imminent because 
      our air, water and food supply were being poisoned with radioactive isotopes. 
      All weapons, nuclear and conventional, reflect the spirit of murder, rather 
      than hope.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      From the right, Philip and friends were ridiculed as professional prisoners, 
      whose actions had no effect on public policy. From the left, he and his 
      friends were accused of destroying property-damaging weapons, and that this 
      was violence. &quot;It is a curious argument&quot;, Philip wrote, &quot;one 
      I've heard many times. Warheads whose sole purpose is to vaporize cities 
      are hardly to be thought of as legitimate property. Bombs that indiscriminately 
      murder millions of men, women and children are not property.&quot; Linguist 
      and political dissident Noam Chomsky called Philip and his brother Daniel, 
      &quot;heroic individuals, willing to do what many realize should be done, 
      regardless of the personal cost, with a simplicity of manner. There are 
      not too many people of whom this can be said.&quot; And so Philip Berrigan 
      died Dec 6, 2002, having spent years in prison for his beliefs. People know 
      the name of an O.J. Simpson, a Koby Bryant, a Michael Jackson, but Philip, 
      trying to save mankind of annihilation and shredded children never made 
      the top of the news. His final message was left unfinished. I sincerely 
      believe because we have been left to finish it. <br>
      <br>
      We live in a world of approximately 6 billion people. On the one hand you 
      have in comparison, a small cadre of a few thousand plus; who in their summits, 
      meetings, dinners, gatherings, board rooms, war rooms and secret sessions 
      decide who will live and who will die; who is expendable collateral damage, 
      who are the herds of human resources to be dumbed down, to compliant passive 
      servitude; what minerals, lands, timbers, waters and natural resources will 
      go to such and such a conglomerate, dividing up the plunder. <br>
      <br>
      Then, there are the hundreds of thousands, millions really; the hirelings, 
      who carry out the messy part of the business in dispossessing people's from 
      their lands, disappearing some, bombing others, and beating and gassing 
      those who dare to dissent in the streets. There's a pecking order here, 
      with some attaining high office and appointments, cabinet positions, agency 
      heads and mouthpieces. Others include attorneys, medical officials, scientists,, 
      military commanders, police departments, media personalities, regulatory 
      personnel and the like. <br>
      <br>
      We applaud the peacemakers and sometimes even attend organized events. The 
      well rounded life should have us involved in some kind of community action. 
      But there it ends. We object to injustice, to war, to hunger and people 
      being dispossessed. In our sympathy, it is possible to encompass the whole 
      of humanity, costing us nothing! Our outcry, our anger and outrage; is but 
      for the moment, having no lasting effect. We protest feebly. Least in our 
      protesting there might come a cost to our personal lives, our comfort zones, 
      our standing in the community; what will the neighbors, church members or 
      relatives say? <br>
      <br>
      Perfect Love casts out all fear, and here may lie the obstruction, the barrier 
      to our making a real difference. How can we honestly say to ourselves that 
      we love those that are thousands of miles away, whom we will never meet, 
      let alone have to feed, comfort and grieve with? If we can't even love those 
      in our communities, how can we love the stranger and cry out for them? There 
      are the excuses. We are offended at the lack of culture, the social standing, 
      the language of another, who may speak out of turn (according to our way 
      of seeing things). We find this the perfect reason to voice our righteous 
      indignation; as if we were without flaw, without blemish, without fault! 
      With a harumph, we dismiss anyone who dares to offend our expectations or 
      sensibilities. It's called hypocrisy and the easy way out. We are called 
      to love the unlovable and to touch the untouchable; not merely those who 
      meet our imaginary plumb line. Would that we would manage such passion and 
      outrage over real issues; such as the homeless, hungry, suffering in our 
      own midst; due to the corruption of the system that serves the interests 
      of the idle rich, powerful and well-connected! But no, it's much easier 
      to fault those of lesser credentials, the powerless. No cost here. <br>
      <br>
      Love asks that you give up fear, resentment, shame, hurt, and any expectation 
      of reciprocated love. Love asks that you forgive all wrongs done. This does 
      not mean you forget harm done or continue to place yourself in harm's way. 
      You are to claim full responsibility for your acts. Love commands of us 
      that we simply give of our hearts freely and unconditionally. <br>
      <br>
      Vishal Ghariwala tells us, &quot;Love is without a doubt the greatest gift 
      of the Divine. Love is truly Divine. It represents love of the highest form; 
      Unconditional Love. Many of us have a very vague idea of what unconditional 
      love is. The reason is simple. Society never gave any importance to the 
      term, &quot;unconditional'. When two good friends become sore enemies, the 
      love which once existed between them often miraculously disappears, simply 
      because of the subconscious agreement based on CONDITIONS such as; this 
      friendship is valid if and on if .....and if and only if....and if and only 
      if. If any of these CONDITIONS are not met, then....we shall see about it.&quot; 
      <br>
      <br>
      &quot;Love will always be a weakness as long as it is conditional. Love 
      which hurts is CONDITIONAL love. In a loving relationship, when something 
      happens, contradicts your 'expectation' and 'preconceived' thoughts, you 
      experience a state of shock and disbelief. Hidden underneath is anger, which 
      will almost always be transparent. Anger results because reality contradicted 
      your idealistic thoughts. You directly experienced what you thought was 
      impossible. The idealistic thoughts somehow became CONDITIONS that supported 
      your relationship. When those CONDITIONS failed, your emotions were crippled. 
      And you blamed it all on love. Nonetheless, it must be realized that love 
      cannot hurt, because Love is divine. If you feel and experience pain in 
      a loving relationship or friendship, then it simply means that there is 
      a dose of CONDITIONAL attachment and judgment present.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;The pain which results when two people separate, results because a 
      connection is broken. Imagine a cord, something like an umbilical cord, 
      connecting you to your friend or partner. Now imagine a pair of scissors 
      cutting that cord. That is the reason for the pain., if there is no attachment, 
      there would be minimal or no pain at all. But then again, it there such 
      a thing as deep love with non-attachment? Indeed there is such a thing. 
      However, it is extremely difficult to find a person who exhibits this type 
      of love. Once you realize in truth that everything in the cosmos is interconnected, 
      you realize that you will always have the inner-connection.&quot;... <br>
      <br>
      Several months after the Man of Peace died, I again visited Portland, Maine, 
      and took a picture of a dancing bird in the light. I am reminded, when looking 
      at it, of...Philip and (his) message to us all. In the midst of citizens 
      being beaten, gassed, (democracy run amuck) and shot with stun guns by fellow 
      citizens (?) in armored black; because they seek peace and a world of economic 
      equity; the mayhem of holiday shopping distracts from the crisis at hand. 
      And so in the blare of Jingle Bell Rock, the bleached specter from Never-Never 
      Land, warnings of plague, plans for what new experience to seek, new lands 
      to travel, the drum beat of war, and shredded children; we miss the gifts 
      of real value right in our midst in the giving of unconditional love towards 
      our fellow man. You don't &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; people into Democracy 
      or liberating love! The Man of Peace now with the Child of Light telling 
      you so. They are gone, but not their message. Philip left us to finish the 
      message. &quot;Do you hear what I hear.........&quot;</p>

    the middle of nowhere 40 years ago. At dawn on July 16, 1945, The Gadget -- 
    nobody referred to it as a bomb -- was detonated in the southern New Mexico 
    desert known as Jornado del Muerto, THE JOURNEY OF DEATH. The code name was 
    &quot;TRINITY.&quot;</p>

    SHE SAID IT HAD A SHAPE LIKE A TREE, but by the time I saw it, it was very 
    swollen and beginning to get whitish.</p>
  <p>Where we were. we were about three miles from it...I began to be worried 
    about my mother because the thing was in the direction of Urakami. (His mother 
    was killed by the bomb). I was just burning up inside, I was so worried. I 
    couldn't stand it. I ran back down to the river and jumped right into the 
    water to cool off.</p>
  <p>After a few minutes I saw something coming up the road along the river that 
    looked like a parade of roast chickens. Some of them kept asking for 'Water! 
    Water!' I wasn't burning up any more. I shivered. I ran back to the cottage. 
    I would rather blind myself than ever to have to see such a sight again.&quot;</p>

<p align="center">The Nagasaki Peace Declaration<br>
  August 9, 2002</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Fifty-seven years ago today, August 9th, the City of Nagasaki was instantly 
    transformed into ruins. Dropped from an altitude of 9,600 meters, a single 
    atomic bomb was detonated 500 meters above the ground, emitting heat rays 
    of several thousand degrees Celsius and creating a blast winds of tremendous 
    force, unleashed against a civilian population of women, the elderly, and 
    blameless children. Some 74,000 people were killed, and 75,000 injured. Radiation-induced 
    leukemia and cancer have gradually claimed many more lives since. Even more 
    than half a century later, the survivors of the atomic bomb suffer constant 
    anxiety over their health, and are stalked by death.</p>
  <p>If the instruments of indiscriminate mass destruction known as nuclear weapons 
    were ever to be used again, the environment would be destroyed and the very 
    survival of all humanity would be jeopardized. The citizens of Nagasaki, having 
    themselves experienced the tragedy of an atomic bombing firsthand, have continued 
    to appeal to the world for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, 
    there remain in existence some 30,000 nuclear warheads, each with unimaginably 
    more destructive power than the bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki. Most of 
    these weapons are in a state of immediate launch readiness.</p>
  <p>Terrorist attacks against the United States were staged on September 11th 
    of last year, and we were outraged at this wanton destruction of life and 
    property. International tensions have since been heightened by the ensuing 
    attacks against Afghanistan and intensified strife in the Middle East, as 
    well as military clashes between India and Pakistan that have threatened to 
    devolve into nuclear conflict. In the midst of such serious international 
    conditions, the government of the United States has unilaterally withdrawn 
    from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty with Russia in the name of terrorist 
    countermeasures, and is moving forward with missile defense programs. The 
    United States has also rejected ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear 
    Test Ban Treaty, and has suggested the possibilities of restarting the production 
    of plutonium triggers, developing a new generation of compact nuclear weapons, 
    and engaging in preemptive nuclear strikes. Other concepts, such as the redeployment 
    of many warheads subject to deactivation according to the Strategic Offensive 
    Reductions Treaty with Russia, also run counter to the disarmament efforts 
    of international society. We are appalled by this series of unilateral actions 
    taken by the government of the United States, actions which are also being 
    condemned by people of sound judgment throughout the world.</p>
  <p>Domestically, comments by leaders of the Japanese government concerning reconsideration 
    of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles have also stabbed at the hearts of Nagasaki 
    citizens. As the only nation ever to have sustained nuclear attack, it behooves 
    Japan to stand at the forefront of nuclear arms abolition. For this reason, 
    the Three Non-Nuclear Principles stating that Japan will not possess, manufacture 
    or allow nuclear weapons into the country must be passed into law without 
    delay. The Nagasaki City Council has adopted a resolution calling for such 
    legislation. The Japanese government should embark on the creation of a Northeast 
    Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone, and should clearly present to international 
    society a posture of non-reliance on the &quot;nuclear umbrella.&quot; At 
    the same time, we call on our nation's government to take steps to enhance 
    the welfare of aging atomic bomb survivors residing both within and outside 
    of Japan.</p>
  <p>At home, citizens and local governments in Nagasaki are working together 
    to host a worldwide NGO gathering for the second time in November 2003, and 
    preparations are proceeding apace. As of today, no fewer than 80% of Japan's 
    local governments have declared themselves to be in opposition to nuclear 
    weapons. We are forming linkages among NGOs, local governments, and United 
    Nations institutions, and we are resolved to work for the building of a peaceful 
    society.</p>
  <p>The hibakusha atomic bomb survivors desire that they be the final victims 
    of atomic weapons. May our young people inherit this desire for peace, and 
    may they themselves consider what is to be done, take action, and pass on 
    this spirit to the future. Many of Nagasaki's young people are involved in 
    volunteer activities for peace. The City of Nagasaki supports the expansion 
    of these efforts, and is promoting the Nagasaki Peace Education Program for 
    the training and development of youth who are motivated to take autonomous 
    action.</p>
  <p>The abolition of nuclear arms through mutual understanding and dialogue is 
    an absolute precondition for the realization of a peaceful world. It is up 
    to us, ordinary citizens, to rise up and lead the world to peace.</p>
  <p>Nagasaki must remain the final site of the calamity of nuclear attack. Today, 
    on the 57th anniversary of the atomic bombing, we pray for the repose of those 
    who died, and, in the name of the citizens of the City of Nagasaki, I declare 
    our undying commitment to the complete and permanent elimination of nuclear 
    weapons.</p>

    Mayor of Nagasaki<br>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Truman and I discussed 
    whether or not we were obligated to inform Stalin that we had succeeded in 
    developing a powerful weapon and shortly would drop a bomb in Japan. Though 
    there was an understanding that the Soviets would enter the war with Japan 
    three months after Germany surrendered, which would make their entrance about 
    the middle of August...the president and i hoped that Japan would surrender 
    before then. However...we agreed that because this was uncertain, and because 
    the Soviets might soon be our allies in that war, the President should inform 
    Stalin of our intentions, but do so ina casual way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon the adjournment of the afternoon 
    session, when we arose from the table, the President, accompanied by our interpreter...walked 
    around to Stalin's chair and said, &quot;You may be interested to know that 
    we have developed a new and powerful weapon and within a few days intend to 
    use it against Japan.&quot; I watched Stalin's expression as this was being 
    interpreted, and was surprised that he smiled blandly and said only a few 
    words. When the President and I reached our car, he said that Stalin had replied 
    only, &quot;THAT'S FINE. I HOPE YOU MAKE GOOD USE OF IT AGAINST THE JAPANESE.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I did not believe Stalin grasped 
    the full importance of the President's statement, and thought that on the 
    next day there would be some inquiry about this &quot;new and powerful weapon,&quot; 
    but I was mistaken. I thought then and even now believe that Stalin did not 
    appreciate the importance of that information...but there are others who beieve 
    that...he was already aware of the atom bomb.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Reagan cold warriors, 
  new evidence shows, knew exactly what they were doing, and why.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Five years have now passed since 
    the Berlin Wall was breached, the first material sign of the Soviet empire's 
    decline and fall. As the annals of current history continue to be written, 
    a great geopolitical riddle remains: Did the Reagan administration somehow 
    trigger the collapse of THE EVIL EMPIRE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shortly after the demise of the 
    Soviet Union, Strobe Talbott...said: &quot;The difference from the Kremlin 
    standpoint...between the conservative Republican Administration and a liberal 
    Democratic Administration was not that great. The Soviet Union collapsed, 
    the Cold war ended almost overwhelmingly because of internal contradictions...And 
    even if Jimmy Carter had been reelected and been followed by Walter Mondale, 
    something like what we have now seen probably would have happened.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But a number of former Soviet officials 
    don't see it that way. &quot;American policy in the 1980s was a catalyst for 
    the collapse of the Soviet Union,&quot; is the blunt assessment of former 
    KGB General Oleg Kalugin. he adds, &quot;Reagan and his views disturbed the 
    Soviet government so much they bordered on hysteria. There were cables about 
    an imminent crisis. He was seen as a very serious threat.&quot;...&quot;There 
    was a widespread concern and actual fear of Reagan on the central Committee. 
    He was the last thing they wanted to see in Washington.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...There is new evidence that the 
    Reagan Administration was far more active than had previously been believed. 
    A paper trail of top-secret presidential directives indicates that in 1982, 
    President Reagan and a few key advisors began mapping out a strategic offensive 
    designed to attack the fundamental weaknesses of the Soviet system.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two canons of Reagan thinking drove 
    the strategy. The first was the president's well-known anti-Communism, EXPRESSED 
    IN MORAL TERMS OF GOOD AND EVIL. He did not believe that Communist regimes 
    were &quot;just another form of government,&quot; as George Kennen had once 
    put it, but a monstrous abberation. When the words &quot;evil empire&quot; 
    rolled from his lips, Reagan meant it. But the other important ingredient 
    in his thinking...was his belief in the profound weakness of the Soviet Union. 
    Some of his public pronouncements SEEM RATHER PROPHETIC IN RETROSPECT. &quot;The 
    years ahead will be great ones for our country, for the cause of freedom and 
    the spread of civilization,&quot; he told students at Notre Dame...&quot;The 
    West will not contain Communism it will transcend Communism. We will not bother 
    to denounce it, we'lll dismiss it as a sad, bizarre chapter in human history 
    whose last pages are even now being written.&quot;</font></p>

    in the White House. &quot;Luke 14:31, in which Jesus in talking to the disciples 
    spoke about a king who might be contemplating going to war against another 
    king with his 10,000 men, but he sits down and counsels how good he's going 
    to do against the other fellows 20,000 and then says he may have to send a

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Twisting the meaning 
    of these texts, and failing completely to understand the direct connection

    and having to send a delegation to negotiate under those circumstances -- 
    peace terms -- with the Soviet Union.&quot; </p>
  <p align="left">In his speech to the business and trade representatives Reagan 
    expanded upon this passage with an analogy to the upcoming arms control talks 
    with the Soviet Union: &quot;Ultimately, our security and our hopes for success

  <p>JIMMY CARTER: &quot;Nowadays, one of the most hotly debated historical questions 
    is whether President Truman made the right decision in ordering the atomic 
    bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima...The horrors of a nuclear attack are being 
    compared with what might have happened during weeks of massive bombing with 
    conventional forc, followed by the mainland invasion. In 1984, I was the first 
    senior American statesman to visit Hiroshima, and I was deeply moved by the 
    remaining evidence of destruction, and the estimates of 66,000 deaths from 
    the attack. Clearly this was a devastating military blow with horrific human 
    consequences. STILL, I BELIEVE THAT TRUMAN'S DECISION TO USE THE BOMB WAS 
    CORRECT. REMEMBER, WE WERE IN A DECLARED WAR, DEFENDING DEMOCRACY, OUR NATION, 
    AND OUR CITIZENS...</p>
  <p>Although most Japanes strongly disagree, it seems to me, that THIS DIFFICULT 
    DECISION HAD TWO OVERRIDING BENEFITS. Much greater invasion casualties were 
    avoided, and the terrible evidence of atomic power has proved to be a major 
    deterrent to its subsequent use. THUS, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE VAST, ALMOST 
    UNIMAGINABLE EVIL OF A WORLD WAR, THE LESSER EVIL OF USING THE FIRST ATOMIC 
    WEAPON MAY HAVE BENEFITED HUMANITY IN THE LONG RUN--THOUGH AT AN AWFUL PRICE.</p>
  <p>UNLLIKE SOME PEOPLE OF FAITH, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT PACIFISM IS A NECESSARY 
    ELEMENT OF CHRISTIANITY. This is a choice I made when I joined the navy. I 
    KNEW THERE WOULD BE TIMES, DURING WAR, WHEN I MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE HUMAN LIFE 
    IN DEFENSE OF MY COUNTRY...</p>
  <p>...Had my Christianity been of the type that the Quakers and some others 
    espouse, I would have been a conscientious objector rather than serve in the 
    military. (I might also never have accepted political office, EXACTLY! since 
    this could have required me, as president, to send soldiers to their death). 
    BUT PACIFISM WAS NOT MY CHOICE.</p>
  <p>SACRIFICING LIVES IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY, and as 
    a submarine officer and then as commander in chief during the Cold War years, 
    I WAS PREPARED TO USE THE WEAPONS AT OUR DISPOSAL to destroy Soviet submarine 
    OR RESPOND TO A NUCLEAR MISSILE OR ANY OTHER MILITARY ATTACK THAT THREATENED 
    OUR NATION. THIS DECISION APPLIED A DIRECT NUCLEAR RESPONSE AGAINST SOVIET 
    TARGETS...</p>
  <p>Even before my inauguration as president, I was thoroughly briefed about 
    our military forces, and I consulted then and throughout my term with wise 
    and knowledgeable people who shared my cautious approach to the use of our 
    military power. MY PRIMARY COMMITMENT WAS TO PROTECT AMERICA'S INTERESTS while 
    living peacefully with the Soviet Union. IF PEACEKEEPING EFFORTS FAILED, AS 
    HAPPENED BEFORE WORLD WARS I AND II, I WAS PREPARED TO USE FORCE IF NECESSARY. 
    In addition, the mutual know-ledge of our of our mighty response capability 
    was the greatest possible deterrence to an enemy attack and the destructiveness 
    of the alternative--A THIRD WORLD WAR. THUS, ALTHOUGH THE LIFE-AND-DEATH POWER 
    I HELD AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF WAS SOBERING, I WAS, AND AM CONVINCED OF THE

  <p>RELIGION AND NUCLEAR WAR</p>
  <p>The position that fundamentalist/born-again religious organizations have 
    taken on nuclear war stands in stark contrast to that of other churches in 
    the West. In the vanguard of peace, the World Council of Churches and the 
    Catholic Church have both condemned nuclear war. The Lutheran Churches of 
    the Netherlands and the two Germanys have also played a prominant role in 
    the peace movement. The Catholic Church and other religious bodies in Central 
    and Latin America and the Third World have more often placed human justice 
    on the top of their agenda and provided martyrs for this cause. People facing 
    the continual torments of hunger, poverty, deprivation, and dispossession

  <p>...Nixon's attitude toward the Soviet Union indicated at least a level of 
    pragmatism...but in the voices of Ronald Reagan, Caspar Weinberger, and the 
    unholy alliance of the New Right -- the Born-Again movement, the &quot;Moral 
    Majority,&quot; and their psychotically anti-Soviet advisers -- any hint of 
    pragmatism or politics disappears, drowned out by the shrill, clear voices 
    of true believers, the nuclear holy cruaders. This alliance of the ultra-conservatives, 
    fundamentalists, and scholars of apocalypse links nuclear armament to moral 
    rearmament and crusades for a holy Christian war against &quot;godless communism.&quot; 
    Reagan's favorite phrase. </p>
  <p>They have butressed their preaching with plans for a huge arms build-up to 
    fight and win any nuclear war or to destroy Soviet communism by blackmail, 
    coercion, or economic suffocation. Their cliche-and-slogan-filled rhetoric 
    tragically reflects a simplistic world view untainted by the complexity of 
    reality <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the author himself does 
    not understand what he is saying here...2 Thessalonians 1:4-10...KJV)</font>. 
    The danger lies in the sincerity of their belief. . When Reagan said, &quot;It 
    is time for us to start a (military) build-up and it is time for us to build 
    to the point that no other nation on this earth will ever dare TO RAISE A 
    HAND AGAINST US, and in this way we will preserve the peace, he really meant 
    it. It is necessary to make this link between Reagan's and Weinberger's fundamentalists 
    beliefs, the organized campaign against secularism, ultraconservatism, and 
    the military and other policies of the administration...</p>

    defense under Carter, used the expression &quot;countervailing&quot; strategy, 
    which really meant that the U.S. must develop the capacity to &quot;prevail&quot; 
    at any level of escalation in a nuclear conflict. Supporters of Brown's strategy 
    argued that it had merit for deterrence, although the more sane, in their 
    moments of candor, expressed doubt that a nuclear war could be &quot;surgically 
    controlled.&quot; No such doubts cloud the official policy of the Reagan administration.

<blockquote> 
  <p>In its most frightening aspect, the Reagan administration couples its warfighting 
    policy with a fundamentalist, religious world-view. The end of the world is 
    engrained in the minds of the reborn. Armageddon is not a mere tenuous prophecy, 
    but an absolute prediction. For key members of the administration, Armageddon 
    is the basis of policy. In a radio interview on &quot;Washington Talk,&quot; 
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was asked if he believed the world was 
    going to end and if so, &quot;Will it be by an act of God or an act of man?&quot; 
    Weinberger replied &quot;I have read the book of Revelation and, yes, I believe 
    the world is going to end -- by an act of God I hope...I worry that we will 
    not have time to get strong enough...I fear we will not be ready. I think 
    time is running out...but I have faith.&quot; Interior Secretary James Watt 
    stands on record with the same belief, and thus his policies were designed 
    to make the environment expendable. One hundred religious leaders accused 
    the Reagan administration of taking the position that &quot;reconciliation 
    with America's adversaries is ultimately futile.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(As 
    one discovers the mind-set of the Reagan administration, they should immediately 
    think of the mind-set of the present Bush administration. The last is the 
    brainchild of the first)</font>. At a conference of religious leaders in the 
    Washington Hotel in 1984, The Christic Institute claimed to have collected 
    eleven statements by Reagan that suggested the imminence of Armegeddon. In 
    the sacond Mondale-Reagan debate, Ronnie characteristically brushed the charge 
    aside, but Rabbi Bricker claimed Mr. Reagan had &quot;talked about it in a 
    serious frightning way.&quot; The internal logic is terrifying; if the world 
    is going to end and if God is on your side, then, &quot;an act of man&quot; 
    becomes &quot;an act of God.&quot;</p>

  <p>THE BATTLE OF ARMAGEDDON</p>
  <p>The current fundamentalist theology of Armageddon is convoluted and complicated. 
    The &quot;born-again&quot; group expressly believes that at present the world 
    is in an age of satanic control...Shortly, Soviet, European, Iranian, Arabian, 
    African, and Chinese armies will invade ISRAEL and be totally destroyed, possibly 
    by a nuclear war. A remnant of Israelites will be saved to accept Jesus as 
    their messiah. Christ and an army of saints will then return to earth to punish 
    the unbelievers and destroy the forces of anti-Christ in the &quot;big one, 
    the battle of Armageddon...Reagan has been quoated as saying &quot;Never has 
    there been a time in which so many (biblical) prophecies are coming together. 
    There have been times in the past when people thought the end of the world 
    was coming, and so forth, but never anything like this,&quot; and &quot;Jerry, 
    I sometimes believe we are heading very fast for Armageddon.&quot;</p>
  <p>Jerry Falwell, head of the Moral Majority, predicted the Russians would have 
    come from across the Mexican border by 1981, &quot;if Reagan had not been 
    elected in 1980.&quot; In an interview with Robert Scheer, Falwell stated,, 
    &quot;We believe that Russia...is going to move in on the Middle East, and 
    particularly Israel, because of their hatred of the Jew, and that it is at 
    that time that all hell will break out. And it is at that time when I believe 
    there will be some nuclear holocaust on this earth.&quot; Falwell, like Reagan, 
    denied all all this on behalf of most evangelicals; however, the statement 
    of one hundred religious leaders at the Christic Institute's conference correctly 
    identified the Religious Right as proclaming, through some of its leaders, 
    &quot;an ideology of nuclear Armageddon.&quot; The images of the &quot;Last 
    Days&quot; present in sketches of the &quot;Day After&quot; and &quot;nuclear 
    winter&quot; link the holocaust and the final battle of Armageddon to the 
    devastation of nuclear war. The way out for true believers is based on the 
    Rapture concept.</p>
  <p>The arrival of the anti-Christ heralds the biblical end of the world. Napoleon 
    seemed to be this anti-Christ to believers at the start on the nineteenth 
    century. Since the 1950s American fundamentalists have applied the anti-Christ 
    mantle to Soviet leaders and the entire communist system...</p>

    and an anticommunist world view. With his assertion that the Soviets were 
    the force and &quot;focus of evil&quot; in this world, and that &quot;God 
    has been driven out of the schools.&quot; Reagan sought the active support 
    of Jerry Falwell and company. In overlaying politics and national interest 
    with &quot;Christian&quot; dogma, Reagan broke with two of America's greatest 
    democratic traditions, the separation of church and state and the rule of 
    law. The new conservative agenda seeks unreasonable restrictions on travel

    Ronald Reagan...and the rest of the &quot;good&quot; will suddenly vanish. 
    The Soviets will invade Israel...How could the Bible be wrong! According to

    in Falwell's version of &quot;The Russians are Coming.&quot; The remaining 
    seven years of Tribulation will be occupied entirely with burying Soviet soldiers 
    and burning (weapons)...</p>
  <p>The crux of this issue is whether the most powerful man in the world, the 
    president of the United States...believes all this...The Moral Majority asserts 
    its moral superiority but offers no intellectual analysis of nuclear war. 
    No questions are asked about the notion of justice or whether war can ever 
    be just. No questions are raised about the strategy or doctrine of nuclear 
    warfighting. The bankrupt assumption of morality based on the oversimplified 
    virtues of family and faith has neither form nor content. Their church has 
    become the town meeting place for propounding a red-neck theology, tainted 
    by elements of racism and chauvinism. Images of fire and brimstone instill 
    fear and blind adherence. God and evil are <i>de facto</i> concepts, presented 
    without analysis or justification. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Our

<p align="center">RESISTING THE BOMB, A HISTORY OF THE WORLD NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT 
  MOVEMENT</p>
<p align="center">By Lawrence S. Winter, Reviewed by Colman McCarthy</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>In the international peace movement -- ranging from the valient Women Strike 
    for Peace to the persistent Fellowship of Reconciliation -- no shortage exists 
    of dissenters willing to defy governments that trust in nuclear weapons to 
    solve conflicts. Where a shortage -- of another kind -- can be found is among 
    the media, in the journalistic decisions of editors and reporters to dismiss 
    the nuclear disarmament movement as a collection of fringe rebels unversed 
    in the ways of national security and too emotional to appreciate the wisdom 
    of &quot;peace through strength.&quot;...</p>
  <p>&quot;Resisting the Bomb&quot; covers 1954 through 1970 and antinuclear campaigns 
    in dozens of nations involving millions of citizens. Under President Dwight 
    Eisenhower, the Atomic Energy Agency conducted its first hydrogen bomb explosion 
    at Bikini atoll in the Marshall Islands in March 1954. Within weeks, highly 
    radioactive fallout caused illnesses among islanders and crew members of a 
    Japanese fishing boat downwind. All were well beyond the test site's supposed 
    danger zone. Trying to quash the international uproar caused by the news of 
    effects of the effects of the blast on human beings, the AEC chairman, Lewis 
    Strauss, claimed that the islanders appeared &quot;well and happy.&quot; The 
    illnesses among the Japanese fishermen? That was &quot;due to the chemical 
    activity of the converted material in the coral rather than to radioactivity.&quot;...</p>
  <p>In late 1957 the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy--known as SANE--was 
    formed. Within months, it had a national membership of 25,000 chapters. No 
    other peace group could match its size or influence. It's goal was to halt 
    the testing of nuclear weapons as &quot;a first step in the direction of disarmament.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sticking with its pro-nuke editotial stand, the New York Daily News called 
    SANE's leaders &quot;as nutty as so many fruitcakes.&quot; Time magazine condemned 
    the organization for being suckered into believing &quot;the horror stories 
    of nuclear fallout.&quot; It had been duped by &quot;the sworn enemies of 
    religion, liberty and peace,&quot; or whatthe chairman of the House Committee 
    on Un-American Activities called &quot;the black hand of the Communist conspiracy.&quot;...</p>
  <p>Wittner, a pacifist and member of the War Resisters League, is professionally 
    dispasionate in assessing the achievements with which he is personally in 
    agreement. he writes: &quot;All it wanted, the movement argued, was to ban 
    the Bomb. But, as policymakers and portions of the public well understood, 
    banning the Bomb would have substantial effects on national security policies. 
    Under great popular pressure, policymakers might limit nuclear testing, regulate 
    the arms race, or draw back from nuclear war. But, for the most part, they 
    were not about to give up their nuclear weapons or, for that matter, reform 
    the international system.</p>

    to go ahead and develop a national missile shield--but only after extensive

    to a new arms race to ensure that its strategic rocket forces will not be 
    undermined...</font></p>

    has expressed longstanding concerns about Russia's assistance to Iran's ballistic 
    missile program...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Mr. Putin was preparing his 
    diplomatic moves, Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev said that Russia was making 
    contingency plans to respond to the Bush administration's antimissile plans. 
    He said Russia was not planning a new missile buildup, which it cannot afford, 
    but &quot;asymmetrical&quot; technologies that would penetrate any missile 
    shield. &quot;We had three mighty programs to counter asymmetrically the national 
    missile defense systems of the United States during the period of REAGAN'S 
    STAR WARS,&quot; he said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He told the Interfax news agency 
    that &quot;a lot of money was invested in those programs &quot; before they 
    were abandoned at the end of the cold war. &quot;But we still have them,&quot; 
    he added, &quot;and can take them up again.&quot; Marshall Sergeyev, the former

    would violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which the Bush administration

    DICTATOR COULD SEEK SAFETY FOR HIMSELF OR HIS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critics are bound to argue that 
    Mr. Bush is making a radical and dangerous shift to a first-strike policy. 
    But in the nuclear standoff of the cold war, the United States never declared 
    a no-first-strike policy (Russia did) against its nuclear adversaries; it 
    simply made massive retaliation a credible threat by building a triad of AIR, 
    LAND AND SEA weapons, enough of which, in theory, would survive any plausible 
    first strike by the Soviet Union,the only real strategic threat that the United 
    States faced...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even though a pre-emptive, limited 
    nuclear strike might be contemplated in an unexpected emergency, it would

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indeed, the United States has not 
    gone so far as to renounce its pledge--made similarly by all the other big 
    nuclear powers--nnot to make a nuclear attack on any country that has none. 
    But the Pentagon's plan to build nuclear weapons expressly for such an attack, 
    just in case, undermines the credibility of that pledge...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Pentagon's nuclear force will 
    continue to shrink both in numbers, and in megatonnage, as some of the new 
    weapons would carry small special-purpose warheads. That does not altar the 
    Bush administration's unapologetic premise that the quilt of arms control 
    agreements stitched together during the cold war era should be consigned to 
    the reliquary.&quot;That old process is incompatible with the flexibility 
    U.S. planning and forces now require,&quot; the report says...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And partly because a nuclear superpower

  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Can Be Done About The Growing 
  Nuclear Threat?</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Jonathan Schell</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The world has entered a new nuclear 
    age, a second nuclear age. The danger is rising that nuclear weapons will 
    be used against the United States. Just as bad, the danger is rising that 
    the United States will use nuclear weapons against others. A paradoxical product 
    of the new danger is the Bush administration's proposal to achieve the nuclear 
    disarmament of Iraq (which may or may not be trying to build nuclear weapons) 
    by overthrowing the regime of Saddam Hussein. To understand why, we have to 
    look back to the beginning of the post-Cold War period.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the Cold War ended, many Americans, 
    encouraged by official statements, came to believe that nuclear danger might 
    be a thing of the past. The conclusion was not surprising. The world's great 
    nuclear arsenals, we had been told for some 40 years, were built for a purpose&#151;waging 
    the Cold War&#151;and that purpose melted away with the disappearance of the 
    Soviet Union. Might not the arsenals also melt away? What earthly purpose 
    did they serve? Russia was our friend. Could it possibly make sense any longer 
    to threaten it with annihilation&#151;and to go on enduring the threat of 
    annihilation at Russian hands? And indeed, reductions were occurring under 
    the auspices of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, and more could be expected. 
    Perhaps nuclear weapons were now simply the detritus of an age of peril that 
    had passed, and would be carted away. PERHAPS ONE DAY WE'D WAKE UP and discover 
    that the last warhead had been dismantled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The large hopes and modest achievements 
    of the early post-Cold War years, however, bred complacency rather than a 
    determination to act. Opportunity was mistaken for accomplishment, and little 
    was done. Nuclear danger dropped out of public consciousness. Nuclear arms 
    control negotiations slowed to a creep. In the ensuing atmosphere of official 
    and public indifference, a shockingly different future began to take shape. 
    IT WAS A FUTURE THAT HAD ITS ROOTS IN THE VERY GENETIC CODE OF THE NUCLEAR 
    THREAT. Nuclear arsenals are based on scientific and technical knowledge. 
    It is the destiny of knowledge to spread. In the absence of clear political 
    decisions to constrain the weapons, nuclear proliferation must be the result. 
    During the Cold War, nuclear danger grew to threaten all points of the compass. 
    In the post-Cold War period, if current trends are not reversed, nuclear danger 
    will in addition arise at all points of the compass.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet if we are to understand the 
    origins of the new nuclear dangers, we must grasp their connection with the 
    old ones. Existing nuclear arsenals&#151;the legacy of the Cold War&#151;are 
    inextricably linked to the budding arsenals of our time. Proliferation (to 
    new countries or terrorists), in a word, is linked to possession (by the existing 
    nuclear powers), and we cannot hope to address the former without addressing 
    the latter.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IN THE EARLY years of the Clinton 
    administration, it became clear that the United States would not seize the 
    immense opportunity for nuclear disarmament that the end of the Cold War presented. 
    The United States had already brushed aside Gorbachev's proposal to eliminate 
    nuclear weapons by the year 2000. Clinton's Nuclear Posture Review, announced 
    as an attempt to reconsider the need for nuclear forces in the post-Soviet 
    era, concluded that things should remain substantially the same as before: 
    Even in the absence of the Cold War enemy, the United States would retain 
    immense nuclear arsenals and threaten their use&#151;not merely in retaliation 
    but even in a first strike. In early 1998, news leaked out that a new Presidential 
    Decision Directive had been issued. One of its conclusions, as Robert G. Bell, 
    a member of Clinton's National Security Council, told The Washington Post, 
    was that the United States should retain nuclear weapons &quot;for the indefinite 
    future.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These critical decisions by the 
    United States, matched by comparable decisions by the other Cold War nuclear 
    powers, were little remarked on by the public, but they were watched closely 
    in other capitals, where decisions whether to build new nuclear arsenals were 
    being made. The most important were New Delhi, where the Indian government, 
    already the possessor of a &quot;peaceful&quot; non-weaponized bomb, was deciding 
    whether to become a full-fledged nuclear power, and Islamabad, where the Pakistani 
    government, nervously eyeing India, was asking itself the same question. If 
    nuclear weapons were to be the currency of power in the new age, India reasoned, 
    then India must have them. Continued renunciation would constitute &quot;nuclear 
    apartheid,&quot; its foreign minister said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May 1998, India conducted five 
    nuclear tests. Pakistan responded with six. The South Asian nuclear arms race 
    was underway. In early 2002, the two powers engaged in the first full-scale 
    nuclear confrontation of the nuclear age entirely unrelated to the Cold War. 
    Other countries&#151;including Iraq, Iran, and North Korea&#151;also were 
    developing nuclear programs. Recently Yasuo Fukuda, chief of staff to Prime 
    Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan, aired his opinion that Japan might have 
    to reconsider its ban on nuclear weapons in its armed forces, and though the 
    government disavowed any such intention, other important figures in Japan 
    voiced their agreement.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, proliferation was increasing 
    the danger of nuclear terrorism. Plainly, the more nuclear powers there are 
    in the world, the more likely it is that nuclear weapons or nuclear materials 
    will fall into the hands of terrorists. The poor guardianship of Russian materials 
    is an enduring international scandal. The danger is acute that Pakistani weapons 
    or materials, many of whose managers are Islamic fundamentalists, will fall 
    into terrorist hands. Before Sept. 11, one veteran of the Pakistani weapon 
    program, Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, paid several visits to Osama bin Laden. 
    Bin Laden has claimed to possess nuclear weapons, and though we may doubt 
    the truth of his claim, no one can dismiss the possibility that his al Qaeda 
    network or some other terrorist group may soon acquire one and use it against 
    the United States or another country.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BUT MOST STARTLING HAS BEEN THE 
    REVOLUTION IN THE UNITED STATES' NUCLEAR POLICY UNVEILED SINCE THE ATTACK 
    OF SEPT. 11. IT THREATENS NOTHING LESS THAN FULL-SCALE NUCLEAR REVIVAL--A

<p align="center"><b>WORLD MAY BE HEADED FOR NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION, El BARADEI SAYS</b><br>

<blockquote> VIENNA (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on 
  Thursday the world could be headed for destruction if it does not stop the spread 
  of atomic weapons technology, which has become widely accessible. <br>
  In an opinion piece in the New York Times, Mohamed El Baradei wrote that nuclear 
  technology, once virtually unobtainable, is now obtainable through &quot;a sophisticated 
  worldwide network able to deliver systems for producing material usable in weapons.&quot; 
  Above all El Baradei echoed President Bush's call in a speech on Wednesday for 
  states to tighten up the control of their companies' nuclear exports to proliferators. 
  <p>El Baradei, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director-general, 
    said the world must act quickly because inaction would a create a proliferation 
    disaster. &quot;The supply network will grow, making it easier to acquire 
    nuclear weapon expertise and materials. Eventually, inevitably, terrorists 
    will gain access to such materials and technology, if not actual weapons,&quot; 
    he wrote. &quot;If the world does not change course, we risk self-destruction,&quot; 
    ElBaradei said. </p>
  <p>The father of Pakistan's atom bomb, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted last week 
    that he and scientists from his Khan Research Laboratory in Pakistan leaked 
    nuclear secrets. They are believed to have been part of a global nuclear black 
    market organized to help countries under embargo such as Iran, North Korea 
    and Libya skirt international sanctions and obtain nuclear technology that 
    could be used to make weapons. The massive illicit network has touched on 
    at least 15 countries around the world. </p>
  <p>El Baradei said the 1968 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the global 
    pact aimed at stopping the spread of atomic weapons, needed to be revisited 
    and toughened to bring it in line with the demands of the 21st century. He 
    said it should not be possible to withdraw from the NPT, as North Korea did 
    last year, while the tougher inspections in the NPT Additional Protocol should 
    be mandatory in all countries. Currently fewer than 40 of the more than 180 
    NPT signatories have approved the protocol. </p>

  <p>(continued)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The United States 
    has always been the world's leader in matters nuclear. Our country invented 
    the atomic bomb, was its first and only user, invented the H-bomb, developed 
    the strategy of deterrence that guided and rationalized the Cold War buildup, 
    and pioneered almost every innovation in delivery vehicles of the nuclear 
    age. Now, by finding new uses for nuclear weapons, building new nuclear weapons 
    and delivery vehicles, and building new anti-nuclear defenses, the United 
    States once again is taking the lead in the nuclearization of the international 
    arena. </font>(Understand the prophetic implications of Psalm 106:34-40)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reversing 50 years of precedent, 
    the Bush administration has decided to deal with proliferation not through 
    diplomacy and treaties but through the use of force, including nuclear force. 
    This is the radical policy shift that underlies the administration's call 
    to overthrow the government of Iraq by force. In his 2002 State of the Union 
    address, Bush melded nonproliferation policy into the war on terrorism, lumping 
    three potential nuclear proliferators&#151;Iraq, Iran, and North Korea&#151;together 
    in the &quot;axis of evil,&quot; to whom he delivered something of an ultimatum. 
    &quot;THE UNITED STATES,&quot; he announced, &quot;WILL NOT PERMIT THE WORLD'S 
    MOST DANGEROUS REGIMES TO THREATEN US WITH THE WORLD'S MOST DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS.&quot; 
    </font>(Revelation 13:4-10)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. If 
    in the '90s continued possession had led to proliferation, proliferation now 
    had led to pre-emption. That is, having failed to put a stick in the gears 
    of proliferation by committing itself to abolition, the United States now 
    proposes to stop it by military means&#151;by &quot;counter proliferation.&quot; 
    Meanwhile, the United States will seek to defend itself against retaliation 
    by building a missile defense system&#151;a system that will do nothing, of 
    course, to protect against bombs delivered by car, boat, or truck.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new policy, called &quot;offensive 
    deterrence,&quot; has come into effect. Its linchpin, as in the planning for 
    war in Iraq, is the pre-emptive strike, conventional and nuclear. The president 
    has made it known to the world in the bluntest terms. Though deterrence and 
    containment&#151;the mainstays of Cold War policy&#151;will remain in effect 
    in some areas, the new policy will be to attack first. America, the president 
    said in his speech to the graduating class at West Point, must &quot;be ready 
    to strike at a moment's notice in any dark corner of the world.&quot; For 
    &quot;Deterrence&#151;the promise of massive retaliation against nations&#151;means 
    nothing against shadowy terrorist networks with no nation or citizens to defend. 
    Containment is not possible when unbalanced dictators with weapons of mass 
    destruction can deliver those weapons on missiles or secretly provide them 
    to terrorist allies.&quot; Thus the United States must &quot;be ready for 
    pre-emptive action.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new Nuclear Posture Review, leaked 
    to the press in March, added detail to the new policy. New nuclear weapons, 
    including something actually called a &quot;Robust Earth Penetrator,&quot; 
    would be built. A new plant to build nuclear weapons would start production 
    in 2030. A new ICBM would be readied for the year 2020, a new submarine-launched 
    missile for 2030, a new bomber for 2040. A widening array of nuclear targets&#151;RUSSIA, 
    CHINA, LIBYA, SUDAN, NORTH KOREA, IRAQ, IRAN&#151;were named.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As these new dangers were being 
    born, were the old dangers from the Cold War arsenals at least being liquidated? 
    No. The recently signed agreement by Bush and President Vladimir Putin of 
    Russia cutting operational strategic weapons to about 2,000 on each side over 
    the next 10 years will remove the weapons from delivery vehicles but not dismantle 
    them. In the year 2012&#151;21 years after the fall of the Soviet Union&#151;there 
    would still be more than 10,000 nuclear warheads in the American arsenal. 
    Even the operational arsenal of some 2,000 will be enough for the two countries&#151;putative 
    allies&#151;to destroy one another many times over.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new American policy provides 
    the missing link in a vicious circle that is as dangerous as the arms race 
    of the Cold War, if not more so. In this new process, nuclear possession goads 
    proliferation (including proliferation to terrorist groups); proliferation 
    goads missile defenses and pre-emption; and missile defenses and pre-emption 
    in turn goad proliferation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The policy, whose first step is 
    the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, seeks to prevent proliferation and safeguard 
    the United States. IT CAN DO NEITHER. It in fact generates the very threat 
    it hopes to remove. IT IS THE PATH NOT TO SAFETY BUT TO NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION 
    AND NUCLEAR WAR. The vicious circle needs to be disrupted by a beneficial 
    one, in which a commitment by the nuclear powers to abolition and a negotiated 
    program of nuclear reductions becomes the foundation for an effective policy 
    of nonproliferation, and these lead over time to abolition itself, the only 
    sane goal of nuclear policy for the 21st century.</font></p>

<p align="center">A WAR IN THE PLANNING FOR FOUR YEARS</p>
<p align="center">by Michael Ruppert <br>
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Zbigniew Brzezinski and the CFR (Council of Foreign Relations) put War Plans 
    in a 1997 Book &#150; It is &#147;A Blueprint for World Dictatorship,&#148; 
    Says a Former German Defense and NATO Official Who Warned of Global Domination 
    in 1984, in an Exclusive Interview With FT.</p>
  <p>&#147;THE GRAND CHESSBOARD American Primacy And It&#146;s Geostrategic Imperatives,&#148; 
    Zbigniew Brzezinski, Basic Books, 1997.</p>
  <p>These are the very first words in the book, &#147;Ever since the continents 
    started interacting politically, some five hundred years ago, Eurasia has 
    been the center of world power.&#148; - p. xiii. Eurasia is all of the territory 
    east of Germany and Poland, stretching all the way through Russia and China 
    to the Pacific Ocean. It includes the Middle East and most of the Indian subcontinent. 
    The key to controlling Eurasia, says Brzezinski, is controlling the Central 
    Asian Republics. And the key to controlling the Central Asian republics is 
    Uzbekistan. Thus, it comes as no surprise that Uzbekistan was forcefully mentioned 
    by President George W. Bush in his address to a joint session of Congress 
    just days after the attacks of September 11 as the very first place that the 
    U.S. military would be deployed.</p>
  <p>As FTW has documented in previous stories, major deployments of U.S. and 
    British forces had taken place before the attacks. And the U.S. Army and the 
    CIA had been active in Uzbekistan for several years. There is now evidence 
    that what the world is witnessing is a cold and calculated war plan - at least 
    four years in the making &#150; and that, from reading Brzezinski&#146;s own 
    words about Pearl Harbor, the World Trade Center attacks were just the trigger 
    needed to set the final conquest in motion.</p>
  <p>FTW, November 7, 2001, 1200 PST &#150; There&#146;s a quote often attributed 
    to Allen Dulles after it was noted that the final 1964 report of the Warren 
    Commission on the assassination of JFK contained dramatic inconsistencies. 
    Those inconsistencies, in effect, disproved the Commission&#146;s own final 
    conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone on November 22, 1963. Dulles, 
    a career spy, Wall Street lawyer, the CIA director whom JFK had fired after 
    the 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco - and the Warren Commission member who took charge 
    of the investigation and final report - is reported to have said, &#147;The 
    American people don&#146;t read.&#148;</p>
  <p>Some Americans do read. So do Europeans and Asians and Africans and Latin 
    Americans. World events since the attacks of September 11, 2001 have not only 
    been predicted, but also planned, orchestrated and &#150; as their architects 
    would like to believe &#150; controlled. The current Central Asian war is 
    not a response to terrorism, nor is it a reaction to Islamic fundamentalism. 
    It is in fact, in the words of one of the most powerful men on the planet, 
    the beginning of a final conflict before total world domination by the United 
    States leads to the dissolution of all national governments. This, says Council 
    on Foreign Relations (CFR) member and former Carter National Security Advisor, 
    Zbigniew Brzezinski, will lead to nation states being incorporated into a 
    new world order, controlled solely by economic interests as dictated by banks, 
    corporations and ruling elites concerned with the maintenance (by manipulation 
    and war) of their power. As a means of intimidation for the unenlightened 
    reader who happens upon this frightening plan &#150; the plan of the CFR - 
    Brzezinski offers the alternative of a world in chaos unless the U.S. controls 
    the planet by whatever means are necessary and likely to succeed.</p>
  <p>This position is corroborated by Dr. Johannes B. Koeppl, Ph.D. a former German 
    defense ministry official and advisor to former NATO Secretary General Manfred 
    Werner. On November 6, he told FTW, &#147;The interests behind the Bush Administration, 
    such as the CFR, The Trilateral Commission &#150; founded by Brzezinski for 
    David Rockefeller &#150; and the Bliderberger Group, have prepared for and 
    are now moving to implement open world dictatorship within the next five years. 
    They are not fighting against terrorists. They are fighting against citizens.&#148;</p>
  <p>Brzezinski&#146;s own words &#150; laid against the current official line 
    that the United States is waging a war to end terrorism - are self-incriminating. 
    In an ongoing series of articles, FTW has consistently established that the 
    U.S. government had foreknowledge of the World Trade Center attacks and chose 
    not to stop them because it needed to secure public approval for a war that 
    is now in progress. It is a war, as described by Vice President Dick Cheney, 
    &#147;that may not end in our lifetimes.&#148; What that means is that it 
    will not end until all armed groups, anywhere in the world, which possess 
    the political, economic or military ability to resist the imposition of this 
    dictatorship, have been destroyed. These are the &#147;terrorists&#148; the 
    U.S. now fights in Afghanistan and plans to soon fight all over the globe.</p>
  <p>Before exposing Brzezinski (and those he represents) with his own words, 
    or hearing more from Dr. Koeppl, it is worthwhile to take a look at Brzezinski&#146;s 
    background. According to his resume Brzezinski, holding a 1953 Ph.D. from 
    Harvard, lists the following achievements: Counselor, Center for Strategic 
    and International Studies Professor of American Foreign Policy, Johns Hopkins 
    University National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter (1977-81) Trustee 
    and founder of the Trilateral Commission International advisor of several 
    major US/Global corporations Associate of Henry Kissinger Under Ronald Reagan 
    &#150; member of NSC-Defense Department Commission on Integrated Long-Term 
    Strategy Under Ronald Reagan &#150; member of the President&#146;s Foreign 
    Intelligence Advisory Board Past member, Board of Directors, The Council on 
    Foreign Relations 1988 &#150; Co-chairman of the Bush National Security Advisory 
    Task Force.</p>
  <p>Brzezinski is also a past attendee and presenter at several conferences of 
    the Bliderberger group &#150; a non-partisan affiliation of the wealthiest 
    and most powerful families and corporations on the planet.</p>
  <p>THE GRAND CHESSBOARD</p>
  <p>Brzezinski sets the tone for his strategy by describing Russia and China 
    as the two most important countries &#150; almost but not quite superpowers 
    - whose interests that might threaten the U.S. in Central Asia. Of the two, 
    Brzezinski considers Russia to be the more serious threat. Both nations border 
    Central Asia. In a lesser context he describes the Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Iran 
    and Kazakhstan as essential &#147;lesser&#148; nations that must be managed 
    by the U.S. as buffers or counterweights to Russian and Chinese moves to control 
    the oil, gas and minerals of the Central Asian Republics (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, 
    Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan).</p>
  <p>He also notes, quite clearly (p. 53) that any nation that might become predominant 
    in Central Asia would directly threaten the current U.S. control of oil resources 
    in the Persian Gulf. In reading the book it becomes clear why the U.S. had 
    a direct motive for the looting of some $300 billion in Russian assets during 
    the 1990s, destabilizing Russia&#146;s currency (1998) and ensuring that a 
    weakened Russia would have to look westward to Europe for economic and political 
    survival, rather than southward to Central Asia. A dependent Russia would 
    lack the military, economic and political clout to exert influence in the 
    region and this weakening of Russia would explain why Russian President Vladimir 
    Putin has been such a willing ally of U.S. efforts to date. (See FTW Vol. 
    IV, No. 1 &#150; March 31, 2001)</p>
  <p>An examination of selected quotes from &#147;The Grand Chessboard,&#148; 
    in the context of current events reveals the darker agenda behind military 
    operations that were planned long before September 11th, 2001:</p>
  <p>&#147;&#133;The last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed a tectonic 
    shift in world affairs. For the first time ever, a non-Eurasian power has 
    emerged not only as a key arbiter of Eurasian power relations but also as 
    the world&#146;s paramount power. The defeat and collapse of the Soviet Union 
    was the final step in the rapid ascendance of a Western Hemisphere power, 
    the United States, as the sole and, indeed, the first truly global power&#133;(p. 
    xiii)</p>
  <p>&#147;&#133; But in the meantime, it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger 
    emerges, capable of dominating Eurasia and thus of also challenging America. 
    The formulation of a comprehensive and integrated Eurasian geostrategy is 
    therefore the purpose of this book. (p. xiv)</p>
  <p>&#147;The attitude of the American public toward the external projection 
    of American power has been much more ambivalent. The public supported America&#146;s 
    engagement in World War II largely because of the shock effect of the Japanese 
    attack on Pearl Harbor. (pp 24-5)</p>
  <p>&#147;For America, the chief geopolitical prize is Eurasia&#133; Now a non-Eurasian 
    power is preeminent in Eurasia &#150; and America&#146;s global primacy is 
    directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the 
    Eurasian continent is sustained. (p.30)</p>
  <p>&#147;America&#146;s withdrawal from the world or because of the sudden emergence 
    of a successful rival &#150; would produce massive international instability. 
    It would prompt global anarchy.&#148; (p. 30)</p>
  <p>&#147;In that context, how America &#145;manages&#146; Eurasia is critical. 
    Eurasia is the globe&#146;s largest continent and is geopolitically axial. 
    A power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world&#146;s three 
    most advanced and economically productive regions. A mere glance at the map 
    also suggests that control over Eurasia would almost automatically entail 
    Africa&#146;s subordination, rendering the Western Hemisphere and Oceania 
    geopolitically peripheral to the world&#146;s central continent. About 75 
    per cent of the world&#146;s people live in Eurasia, and most of the world&#146;s 
    physical wealth is there as well, both in its enterprises and underneath its 
    soil. Eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the world&#146;s GNP and about three-fourths 
    of the world&#146;s known energy resources.&#148; (p.31)</p>
  <p>Two basic steps are thus required: first, to identify the geostrategically 
    dynamic Eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important 
    shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central 
    external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences 
    of their seeking to attain them;&#133; second, to formulate specific U.S. 
    policies to offset, co-opt, and/or control the above&#133; (p. 40)</p>
  <p>&#147;&#133;To put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal 
    age of ancient empires, the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy 
    are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, 
    to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from 
    coming together.&#148; (p.40)</p>
  <p>&#147;Henceforth, the United States may have to determine how to cope with 
    regional coalitions that seek to push America out of Eurasia, thereby threatening 
    America&#146;s status as a global power.&#148; (p.55)</p>
  <p>&#147;Uzbekistan &#150; with its much more ethnically homogeneous population 
    of approximately 25 million and its leaders emphasizing the country&#146;s 
    historic glories &#150; has become increasingly assertive in affirming the 
    region&#146;s new postcolonial status.&#148; (p.95)</p>
  <p>&#147;Thus, even the ethnically vulnerable Kazakhstan joined the other Central 
    Asian states in abandoning the Cyrillic alphabet and replacing it with Latin 
    script as adapted earlier by Turkey. In effect, by the mid-1990s a bloc, quietly 
    led by Ukraine and comprising Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and sometimes 
    also Kazakhstan, Georgia and Moldova, had informally emerged to obstruct Russian 
    efforts to use the CIS as the tool for political integration.&#148; (p.114)</p>
  <p>&#147;&#133;Hence, support for the new post-Soviet states &#150; for geopolitical 
    pluralism in the space of the former Soviet empire &#150; has to be an integral 
    part of a policy designed to induce Russia to exercise unambiguously its European 
    option. Among these states. Three are geopolitically especially important: 
    Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine.&#148; (p. 121) &#147;Uzbekistan, nationally 
    the most vital and the most populous of the central Asian states, represents 
    the major obstacle to any renewed Russian control over the region. Its independence 
    is critical to the survival of the other Central Asian states, and it is the 
    least vulnerable to Russian pressures.&#148; (p. 121)</p>
  <p>Referring to an area he calls the &#147;Eurasian Balkans&#148; and a 1997 
    map in which he has circled the exact location of the current conflict &#150; 
    describing it as the central region of pending conflict for world dominance 
    - Brzezinski writes: &#147;Moreover, they [the Central Asian Republics] are 
    of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to 
    at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors, namely 
    Russia, Turkey and Iran, with China also signaling an increasing political 
    interest in the region. But the Eurasian Balkans are infinitely more important 
    as a potential economic prize: an enormous concentration of natural gas and 
    oil reserves is located in the region, in addition to important minerals, 
    including gold.&#148; (p.124) [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p>The world&#146;s energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the 
    next two or three decades. Estimates by the U.S. Department of energy anticipate 
    that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015, 
    with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the Far East. 
    The momentum of Asia&#146;s economic development is already generating massive 
    pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and 
    the Central Asian region and the Caspian Sea basin are known to contain reserves 
    of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of Kuwait, the Gulf of Mexico, or 
    the North Sea.&#148; (p.125)</p>
  <p>&#147;Kazakhstan is the shield and Uzbekistan is the soul for the region&#146;s 
    diverse national awakenings.&#148; (p.130)</p>
  <p>&#147;Uzbekistan is, in fact, the prime candidate for regional leadership 
    in Central Asia.&#148; (p.130) &#147;Once pipelines to the area have been 
    developed, Turkmenistan&#146;s truly vast natural gas reserves augur a prosperous 
    future for the country&#146;s people. (p.132)</p>
  <p>&#147;In fact, an Islamic revival &#150; already abetted from the outside 
    not only by Iran but also by Saudi Arabia &#150; is likely to become the mobilizing 
    impulse for the increasingly pervasive new nationalisms, determined to oppose 
    any reintegration under Russian &#150; and hence infidel &#150; control.&#148; 
    (p. 133).</p>
  <p>&#147;For Pakistan, the primary interest is to gain Geostrategic depth through 
    political influence in Afghanistan &#150; and to deny to Iran the exercise 
    of such influence in Afghanistan and Tajikistan &#150; and to benefit eventually 
    from any pipeline construction linking Central Asia with the Arabian Sea.&#148; 
    (p.139)</p>
  <p>&#147;Moreover, sensible Russian leaders realize that the demographic explosion 
    underway in the new states means that their failure to sustain economic growth 
    will eventually create an explosive situation along Russia&#146;s entire southern 
    frontier.&#148; (p.141) [This would explain why Putin would welcome U.S. military 
    presence to stabilize the region.]</p>
  <p>&#147;Turkmenistan&#133; has been actively exploring the construction of 
    a new pipeline through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Arabian Sea&#133;&#148; 
    (p.145)</p>
  <p>&#147;It follows that America&#146;s primary interest is to help ensure that 
    no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global 
    community has unhindered financial and economic access to it.&#148; (p148)</p>
  <p>&#147;China&#146;s growing economic presence in the region and its political 
    stake in the area&#146;s independence are also congruent with America&#146;s 
    interests.&#148; (p.149)</p>
  <p>&#147;America is now the only global superpower, and Eurasia is the globe&#146;s 
    central arena. Hence, what happens to the distribution of power on the Eurasian 
    continent will be of decisive importance to America&#146;s global primacy 
    and to America&#146;s historical legacy.&#148; (p.194)</p>
  <p>&#148;&#133;the Eurasian Balkans &#150; threatens to become a cauldron of 
    ethnic conflict and great-power rivalry.&#148; (p.195)</p>
  <p>&#147;Without sustained and directed American involvement, before long the 
    forces of global disorder could come to dominate the world scene. And the 
    possibility of such a fragmentation is inherent in the geopolitical tensions 
    not only of today&#146;s Eurasia but of the world more generally.&#148; (p.194)</p>
  <p>&#147;With warning signs on the horizon across Europe and Asia, any successful 
    American policy must focus on Eurasia as a whole and be guided by a Geostrategic 
    design.&#148; (p.197)</p>
  <p>&#147;That puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent 
    the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge 
    America&#146;s primacy&#133;&#148; (p. 198)</p>
  <p>&#147;The most immediate task is to make certain that no state or combination 
    of states gains the capacity to expel the United States from Eurasia or even 
    to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role.&#148; (p. 198)</p>
  <p>&#147;In the long run, global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial 
    to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state. Hence, 
    America is not only the first, as well as the only, truly global superpower, 
    but it is also likely to be the very last.&#148; (p.209)</p>
  <p>&#147;Moreover, as America becomes an increasingly multi-cultural society, 
    it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues, 
    except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct 
    external threat.&#148; (p. 211) [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p>THE HORROR&#150; AND COMMENTS FROM SOMEONE WHO WORKED WITH BRZEZINSKI</p>
  <p>Brzezinski&#146;s book is sublimely arrogant. While singing the praises of 
    the IMF and the World Bank, which have economically terrorized nations on 
    every continent, and while totally ignoring the worldwide terrorist actions 
    of the U.S. government that have led to genocide; cluster bombings of civilian 
    populations from Kosovo, to Laos, to Iraq, to Afghanistan; the development 
    and battlefield use of both biological and chemical agents such as Sarin gas; 
    and the financial rape of entire cultures it would leave the reader believing 
    that such actions are for the good of mankind.</p>
  <p>While seconded from the German defense ministry to NATO in the late 1970s, 
    Dr. Johannes Koeppl - mentioned at the top of this article - traveled to Washington 
    on more than one occasion. He also met with Brzezinski in the White House 
    on more than one occasion. His other Washington contacts included Steve Larabee 
    from the CFR, John J. McCloy, former CIA Director, economist Milton Friedman, 
    and officials from Carter&#146;s Office of Management and Budget. He is the 
    first person I have ever interviewed who has made a direct presentation at 
    a Bliderberger conference and he has also made numerous presentations to sub-groups 
    of the Trilateral Commission. That was before he spoke out against them. His 
    fall from grace was rapid after he realized that Brzezinski was part of a 
    group intending to impose a world dictatorship. &#147;In 1983/4 I warned of 
    a take-over of world governments being orchestrated by these people. There 
    was an obvious plan to subvert true democracies and selected leaders were 
    not being chosen based upon character but upon their loyalty to an economic 
    system run by the elites and dedicated to preserving their power.</p>
  <p>In 1983, Koeppl warned, through Op-Ed pieces published in NEWSWEEK and elsewhere, 
    that Brzezinski and the CFR were part of an effort to impose a global dictatorship. 
    His fall from grace was swift. &#147;It was a criminal society that I was 
    dealing with. It was not possible to publish anymore in the so-called respected 
    publications. My 30 year career in politics ended.</p>
  <p>&#147;The people of the western world have been trained to be good consumers; 
    to focus on money, sports cars, beauty, consumer goods. They have not been 
    trained to look for character in people. Therefore what we need is education 
    for politicians, a form of training that instills in them a higher sense of 
    ethics than service to money. There is no training now for world leaders. 
    This is a shame because of the responsibility that leaders hold to benefit 
    all mankind rather than to blindly pursue destructive paths. &#147;We also 
    need education for citizens to be more efficient in their democracies, in 
    addition to education for politicians that will create a new network of elites 
    based upon character and social intelligence.&#148;</p>
  <p>Koeppl, who wrote his 1989 doctoral thesis on NATO management, also authored 
    a 1989 book &#150; largely ignored because of its controversial revelations 
    &#150; entitled &#147;The Most Important Secrets in the World.&#148; He maintains 
    a German language web site at www.antaris.com and he can be reached by email 
    at jbk@antaris.com.</p>
  <p>As to the present conflict Koeppl expressed the gravest concerns, &#147;This 
    is more than a war against terrorism. This is a war against the citizens of 
    all countries. The current elites are creating so much fear that people don&#146;t 
    know how to respond. But they must remember. This is a move to implement a 
    world dictatorship within the next five years. There may not be another chance.&#148;</p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HONG KONG__President Vladimir Putin 
    of Russia arrived in Beijing tonight on a first stop of an Asian tour intended 
    to revive his country's faded diplomatic role in the region and build what 
    could become a Chinese-Russian axis to counter American influence.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Putin is expected to sign at 
    least six accords with Chinese leaders...including a joint statement with 
    President Jiang Zemin condemning American proposals for missile defense systems 
    over North America and Asia. Opposition to the American plan has accelerated 
    a relationship that Russia and China describe as &quot;strategic partnership&quot; 
    intended to counter AMERICAN POWER. &quot;The partnership is an effort to 
    oppose hegemony and supremacy, and one single country domination the world,&quot; 
    said Zhao Huasheng...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While it is not clear how warmly 
    Mr. Putin will embrace the Chinese world view, Western analysts say the rapproachement 
    between the countries is taking on an increasingly anti-American cast. &quot;On 
    one level, this is classic real-politik balance-of-power, but on another it 
    has the appearance of a united front against the United States,&quot; said 
    David Shambaugh, a China specialists at George Washington University and the 
    Brookings Institute in Washington...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weapons are likely to remain the 
    strongest bond in the two countries' economic relationship. China wants weapons 
    to modernize its military and Russia's overdeveloped arms industry is begging

    submarines and Russian guided-missile destroyers...</font></p>

  IRAQ AND &quot;LIBERATION&quot; CLAIM</font><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Maria Golovina</font><br>
  3-26-03 </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Wednesday 
    fired a new broadside against the United States over its military action against 
    Iraq, scorning claims its troops were &quot;liberating&quot; Iraqis and accusing 
    it of defying world opinion. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, using language 
    at times reminiscent of the Cold War rivalry with Washington, said: &quot;What 
    the United States is doing challenges not only Iraq, but the whole world.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Addressing parliament as U.S. and 
    British forces pressed forward to Baghdad, Ivanov said the evidence so far 
    gainsaid U.S. efforts to portray its troops as a liberating force freeing 
    Iraqis from Saddam Hussein's rule. &quot;It is already becoming clear how 
    far removed from reality are their attempts to present military action against 
    Iraq as a triumphant march for the liberation of the Iraqi people with minimal 
    casualties and destruction,&quot; he told the Federation Council (upper house).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He counseled Washington and London 
    not to make unsubstantiated claims to have found caches of banned weapons 
    in Iraq to justify their military offensive. &quot;If there are claims by 
    coalition forces about discovering weapons of mass destruction...only international 
    inspectors can make a conclusive assessment of the origin of these weapons,&quot; 
    he said. &quot;No other evaluation and final conclusion can be accepted.&quot; 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PROTECTING TIES WITH U.S....Ivanov, 
    mindful of the political capital Moscow has built up with Washington by backing 
    the U.S.-led war on terror, strove to maintain a balance in his criticism, 
    saying international relations depended on Russian and U.S. strategic ties. 
    &quot;It is the nature of our partnership that allows us to be honest with 
    each other (and) discuss issues we do not agree on,&quot; he said. <br>
    A senior U.S. official, speaking to reporters in Moscow, played down the significance 
    of Ivanov's comments saying that though U.S.-Russia relations were &quot;strained&quot; 
    they were not irreparably damaged. <br>
    &quot;I think strong language in public doesn't help to manage this disagreement, 
    but we focus on the constructive assurances we are getting in private,&quot; 
    the official, who requested anonymity, said. <br>
    &quot;We also recognize the Russian leadership needs to project a principled 
    position to the domestic audience and to the rest of the international community,&quot; 
    he said. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Ivanov's sharp attack, following 
    President Vladimir Putin's fiece denunciation at the onset of U.S. military 
    action on March 20, nonetheless marked another downturn in relations. Putin, 
    who needs U.S. support and investment to turn Russia's economy round, has 
    fought to protect his newly-forged ties with President Bush. But Russia's 
    opposition to U.S. military action against its former close economic partner 
    and Putin's call for a rapid end to military action has brought the relationship 
    under pressure. Russia, with other U.N. heavyweights France and China, tried 
    unsuccessfully to stop U.S. military action to topple Saddam. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All three argued for more time 
    to be given to U.N. arms inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction 
    in Iraq. Baghdad denies holding any banned arms. The atmosphere has been further 
    soured by Moscow's suspicions that Washington will disregard Russia's economic 
    interests in Iraq after the war is over. Highlighting Russia's fears, the 
    head of a Russian state firm with big oil interests in Iraq said Moscow had 
    little chance of getting a slice of the pie after the war. &quot;Americans 
    don't need anyone else in Iraq, they will control Iraqi crude themselves. 
    Nobody will give the green light for Russian or French firms in Iraq,&quot; 
    said Nikolai Tokarev, head of Zarubezhneft, in an interview with Reuters. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the U.S. offensive, the two 
    powers have become locked in a row over U.S. claims that Russian firms have 
    supplied Iraq with banned military equipment including electronic jamming 
    equipment and night vision goggles. Russia denies the sales were made...And 
    the State Duma (parliament lower house) has delayed a vote to ratify a U.S.-Russia 
    nuclear arms reduction treaty that would slash numbers of deployed warheads 
    held by each side.</font> Reuters Limited.</p>

  ISSUES WARNING TO NATO</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">October 2, 2003</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MOSCOW__A Defense Ministry document 
    released Thursday emphasizes that Russia will have to make radical changes 
    in its military reform plans--INCLUDING ITS NUCLEAR STRATEGY--if NATO continues 
    to exist in its present form. Separately, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said 
    Russia would not rule out a pre-emptive attack anywhere in the world if Russia's 
    interests demand it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The blustery warniing to NATO came 
    in a document on the modernization of the armed forces that was developed 
    by the Ministry and distributed to reporters before President Vladimir Putin 
    met with Ivanov and other top military officials to discuss plans to reform 
    Russia's military, which have drawn opposition from top brass. &quot;If NATO 
    is preserved as a military alliance with its existing offensive military doctrine, 
    this will demand a radical reconstruction of Russian military planning and 
    the principles of construction of the Russian Armed Forces, INCLUDING CHANGES 
    IN RUSSIAN NUCLEAR STRATEGY,&quot; the document says...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last year, Putin and U.S. President 
    George W. Bush signed a treaty under which the two sides are to slash their 
    nuclear arsenals by about two-thirds over a decade. Putin has sharply improved 
    ties with NATO, the Soviet Union's Cold War foe, and accepted its expansion 
    into former Soviet republics on Russia's borders--a major source of Kremlin 
    ire in the 1990s--without vehement opposition. </font>(Think of the Grand 
    Chessboard)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. But many in the military 
    are angry about NATO's expansion and what they see as U.S. military ambitions 
    in regions once dominated by Moscow. They are particulary worried that U.S. 
    and other NATO forces might be based in former Soviet bloc nations of eastern 
    Europe.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Russia is attentively WATCHING 
    the process of NATO's transformation and is counting on the complete removal 
    of direct and indirect componants of an anti-Russian bent from both the military 
    planning and the political declarations of alliance member nations,&quot; 
    the document said. It also says that Russia is counting on expanded political, 
    military and economic cooperation with the United States as well as cooperation 
    in the fight against international terrorism. But it adds that &quot;in relations 
    with the United States, Russia proceeds from the need to strictly observe 
    international law and the primacy of its own national interests.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a clear reference to the U.S.-led 
    war against Iraq without naming any specific countries, it says that the use 
    of force without U.N. approval may prompt countries to seek to develop nuclear 
    weapons as a potential deterrent, hurting international security instead of 
    enhancing it. Putin has strongly criticized the war and has voiced similar 
    worries...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Russian national security doctrine 
    unveiled in 2002 allowed the country's leaders to use all existing forces 
    including nuclear weapons to oppose any attack if other efforts failed to 
    repel the aggressor. The previous doctrine stated that Russia would use nuclear 
    weapons only in cases when its national sovereignty was threatened.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again without mentioning the United 
    States, it also suggests the Russian military is concerned about U.S. efforts 
    to develop new low-yield nuclear weapons and is considering how to respond. 
    &quot;Lowering the threshold of the use of nuclear weapons will require reforming 
    the armed forces command system and approaches to responding to different 
    threats,&quot; it says. </font>The Star Online, Malaysia<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

    the Mennonite World Conference meeting in Wichita. It reads in part: &quot;I 
    want to show you where the idols of this age are hidden. Learn where are the

    for dissenters. Understand that those who bow down to fear trust in these

    The one at Los Alamos, N.M., is where scientists designed and built the world's 
    first atomic bombs. The other lab is at Livermore, Calif., an hour from downtown 
    San Francisco. Through the years these labs have conceived and designed every 
    nuclear warhead in the US arsenal, and they continue to lobby for new weapons 
    and against arms limitation treaties that might cut back on their work.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The making of nuclear weapons begins 
    with the mining and milling of uranium, a mineral found abundantly in the 
    Rocky Mountain and Great Plains states--principally Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, 
    Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota and Texas--and in northern Canada...The uranium 
    ore is transported to three huge enrichment plants owned by the DOE. Plants 
    are located in Paducah, Ky., Oak Ridge, Tenn. and in Piketon, Ohio. Union 
    Carbide (&quot;Today something we do will touch your life&quot;) operates 
    the plant at Oak Ridge and Paducah for the DOE. These plants make the uranium, 
    deuterium and lithium parts for the hydrogen bomb. In addition, United Nuclear

<p align="center">A NUCLEAR ROAD OF NO RETURN<br>
  BUSH''S BID FOR NEW KINDS OF WEAPONS COULD PUT WORLD ON A SUICIDAL COURSE.<br>
  Robert Scheer <br>
  May 13, 2003</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>It turns out the threat is not from Iraq but from us.</p>
  <p>On Sunday, the Washington Post wrote the obituary for the United States' 
    effort to find Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction. &quot;Frustrated, 
    U.S. Arms Team to Leave Iraq,&quot; read the headline, confirming what has 
    become an embarrassing truth &#151; that the central rationale for the invasion 
    and occupation of oil-rich Iraq was in fact one of history's great frauds. 
    The arms inspectors &quot;are winding down operations without finding proof 
    that President Saddam Hussein kept clandestine stocks of outlawed arms,&quot; 
    reported the Post, putting the lie to Colin Powell's Feb. 6 claim at the United 
    Nations that Iraq possessed a functioning program to build nuclear bombs and 
    had hoarded hundreds of tons of chemical and biological materials.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, this does not necessarily mean the world is a safer place. 
    The deadly weapons of mass destruction have proved phantom in Iraq, but the 
    Bush administration is now doing its best to ensure that the world becomes 
    increasingly unstable and armed to the teeth. Although the nuclear threat 
    from Iraq proved to be nonexistent, the United States' threat to use nuclear 
    weapons and make a shambles of nuclear arms control is alarmingly vibrant.</p>
  <p>In its latest bid to frighten the planet into a constant state of shock and 
    awe, our government is accelerating its own leading-edge weapons-of-mass-destruction 
    program: President Bush's allies on the Senate Armed Services Committee have 
    approved ending a decade-old ban on developing atomic battlefield weapons 
    and endorsed moving ahead with creating a nuclear &quot;bunker-buster&quot; 
    bomb. They also rubber-stamped the administration's request for funds to prepare 
    for a quick resumption of nuclear weapons testing.</p>
  <p>What's going on here? Having failed to stop a gang of marauders armed with 
    nothing more intimidating than box cutters, the U.S. is now using the &quot;war 
    on terror&quot; to pursue a long-held hawkish Republican dream of a &quot;winnable 
    nuclear war,&quot; as the president's father memorably described it to me 
    in a 1980 Times interview. In such a scenario, nukes can be preemptively used 
    against a much weaker enemy &#151; millions of dead civilians, widespread 
    environmental devastation and centuries of political blowback be damned.</p>
  <p>Building a new generation of battlefield nuclear weapons sets the stage for 
    another round of the most dangerous arms race imaginable. What has been forgotten 
    in all of the patriotic hoopla is that it is our country that pioneered the 
    creation of weapons of mass destruction over the last half-century. And it 
    was our dropping of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, that sparked 
    the arms race of the Cold War.</p>
  <p>Faced with the reality that nuclear weapons are useful only for mass international 
    suicide, every U.S. president since World War II has pursued a policy of nuclear 
    arms control. Every administration, that is, until this one, which from its 
    first days has made clear its inveterate hostility to arms control. It attacked 
    the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and resurrected the corpse of the &quot;Star 
    Wars&quot; nuclear defense program, even as Bush's first Nuclear Posture Review 
    telegraphed the development of battlefield nuclear weapons and threatened 
    their use against &quot;rogue&quot; nations.</p>
  <p>&quot;We're moving away from more than five decades of efforts to delegitimize 
    the use of nuclear weapons,&quot; warned Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), a dissenter 
    on the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>
  <p>Following our lead, why shouldn't India and Pakistan develop battlefield 
    nuclear weapons? Or Beijing for use against Taiwan and vice versa? After getting 
    China and most nations to accept a testing ban, why would this administration 
    seek to resume testing?</p>
  <p>The current preponderance of our military power, combined with our overweening, 
    xenophobic fear of the rest of the world, has corrupted all rational thought. 
    Sadly, no one will listen to the mayor of Hiroshima, who last month wrote 
    Bush to warn that new U.S. nuclear weapons development represented &quot;a 
    frontal attack on the process of nuclear disarmament.&quot; </p>
  <p>But why listen to someone from Hiroshima? What do those people know about 
    weapons of mass destruction? </p>

    by an Air Force cargo plane in the last developmental step for the nearly 
    11-ton''mother of all bombs.''</p>
  <p> An MC-130E Combat Talon I dropped the 21,700-pound satellite-guided GBU-43/B 
    Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb, or MOAB, over the test range at Eglin Air 
    Force Base in northwestern Florida, said base spokesman Jake Swinson. A plume 
    of smoke rose more than 10,000 feet in the air and was visible 40 miles away 
    in Pensacola, Florida. ``It looked like a big mushroom cloud filled with flames 
    as it grew and grew and grew,'' Swinson said after the afternoon test. ``It 
    was one of the most awesome spectacles I've seen.''</p>
  <p> The Air Force called the test successful, saying the bomb separated cleanly 
    from the aircraft with the help of a parachute at 20,500 feet, glided 41 seconds 
    to its target area and detonated as planned. Officials said the bomb was developed 
    in only nine weeks to be available for use this spring in the Iraq war, but 
    commanders opted not to use it. Its only previous live test came on March 
    11, the week before the U.S.-led invasion.</p>
  <p> The MOAB, the most powerful nonnuclear U.S. bomb, carries 18,700 pounds 
    of high explosives, detonating just above the ground when the tip of the 30-foot-long 
    bomb hits the earth, Swinson said.He said the bomb was now available to U.S. 
    commanders, but said there were no immediate plans for it to go into production. 
    The United States has had larger conventional bombs in the past but none in 
    the current U.S. arsenal is as big. The MOAB is envisioned as a successor 
    to BLU-82, the 15,000-pound ``Daisy Cutter.''</p>
  <p> The ``Daisy Cutter'' was used to clear helicopter landing areas in the Vietnam 
    War and was used in the 1991 Gulf War and in 2001 in Afghanistan. In the latter 
    two conflicts, U.S. commanders used the ``Daisy Cutter'' partly for the psychological 
    effect of such a massive blast.</p>
  <p> Swinson said it was the last of four developmental tests for the MOAB -- 
    nicknamed the ``mother of all bombs'' by some in the military. The two live 
    tests were preceded by two inert tests. Lynda Rutledge, MOAB program manager 
    at Eglin, said there were minor modifications to the MOAB tested on Friday 
    compared to the one detonated in March, adding that the latest test sought 
    to give commanders a chance to understand how the big bomb performs, particularly 
    relating to targeting.</p>

<p align="center"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marching Toward Apocalypse<br>
  by Marko Beljac<br>
  August 26, 2003</font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the leading conservative 
    hawks on Iraq, Charles Krauthammer, wrote in the lead up to the invasion of 
    Iraq that, &quot;before our eyes in a flash, politics has gone cosmic. The 
    question before us is very large and very simple: can, and will, the civilized 
    part of humanity disarm the barbarians who would use the ultimate knowledge 
    for the ultimate destruction?&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Krauthammer to frame the issue 
    of rogue states and weapons of mass destruction in such an apocalyptic manner 
    is entirely justified. If dangerous rogue states were to acquire the ultimate 
    means of destruction, coupled with an international order characterised by 
    might makes right, then our own extinction as a species becomes a distinct 
    possibility. As the philosopher and antiwar campaigner, Bertrand Russell, 
    stated, this would be &quot;rather a pity.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As such it is a worthy question 
    to ask: which rogue state poses the greatest threat to global security? Unfortunately 
    for the hawks, the answer to this question is rather unflattering. Consider 
    a key planning document drawn up by United States Strategic Command, a Clinton-era 
    document mind you, which oversees America's vast nuclear weapons arsenal. 
    This document states, &quot;because of the value that comes from the ambiguity 
    of what the US may do to an adversary if the acts we seek to deter are carried 
    out, it hurts to portray ourselves as too fully rational and cool headed. 
    The fact that some elements may appear to be potentially 'out of control' 
    can be beneficial to creating and reinforcing doubts within the minds of an 
    adversary's decision makers. This essential sense of fear is the working force 
    of deterrence. That the US may become irrational and vindictive if its vital 
    interests are attacked should be a part of the national persona we project 
    to all adversaries.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, the US reserves the right 
    of first use of nuclear weapons, even against an adversary armed only with 
    conventional weapons. As the recent Pentagon nuclear posture review stipulated, 
    the US may use nuclear weapons if its conventional military forces face defeat 
    on distant battlefields. If one were to have the temerity to defend oneself 
    successfully from American attack then instant annihilation awaits.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you happen to be a potential 
    target of such an irrational nuclear armed state what responses are open to 
    you? The answer to that question is pretty obvious: acquire weapons of mass 
    destruction yourself. Precisely the reason why states such as North Korea 
    have an abiding interest in weapons of mass destruction. It should be noted 
    that this is well known to policy makers in Washington. For instance Donald 
    Rumsfeld himself wrote in a congressional report during the Clinton years 
    that, &quot;for those seeking to thwart the projection of US power, the capability 
    to combine ballistic missiles with weapons of mass destruction provides a 
    strategic counter to US conventional and information based military superiority.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US is also going along with 
    plans to militarize space. The militarization of space is meant to give Washington, 
    according to Rumsfeld, &quot;space control&quot; so that it may &quot;project 
    power in, through and from space.&quot; This directly threatens Russia and 
    China's nuclear early warning system. Threatening these warning systems greatly 
    increases the chances of a large scale accidental nuclear exchange. A part 
    of this space programme is National Missile Defence. A National Intelligence 
    report concluded that a National Missile Defence system would lead to Russia 
    and China increasing the size and scope of its nuclear forces in order to 
    strengthen their deterrents. As China increases its nuclear arsenal, so would 
    India. As India expands its nuclear arsenal, so would Pakistan. Israel may 
    do likewise, which may prompt Iran to enter the race. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US, in waging a preventative 
    (not pre-emptive) war against Iraq, has effectively torn up the entire fabric 
    of international law. Middle powers such as Australia have a keen interest 
    in the health of international law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US, like any rogue state, reserves 
    the right to wage offensive war whenever and however it feels like. Yet this 
    rogue state has thousands of nuclear weapons, which it chooses to brandish 
    in an irrational and vindictive way. Moreover, Washington's nuclear unilateralism 
    has resulted in the US scuttling existing strategic arms control regimes, 
    which is what one would expect of a global rogue state posing a clear and 
    present threat to global security. As we have noted the US is creating strong 
    incentives for vertical nuclear proliferation, that is, arms racing amongst 
    existing nuclear powers, just as it is creating incentives for further horizontal 
    proliferation, that is, proliferation amongst non-nuclear powers. Furthermore, 
    as a rogue state that stresses the right to act irrationally and vindictively, 
    as well as to wage preventative war, the US threatens to effectively create 
    a system of multiple overlapping nuclear arsenals where strategic command 
    and control systems would be tightly coupled.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the expert on nuclear command 
    and control, Paul Bracken, has observed that tight coupling greatly increases 
    the chances for technical error as a small perturbation in the system may 
    lead to mutual accidental launch. As Bracken stated, &quot;in the world in 
    which people live, power grids fail, trains derail, bridges and dams fall 
    down, DC-10 engines fall off, and nuclear power plants come close to meltdown. 
    These things don't happen often, but they do occur.&quot; Writing in 1988 
    he goes on, &quot;a 1965 power failure in the American Northeast was traced 
    to a single inexpensive switch. It was said repeatedly after 1965 that such 
    a cascading power blackout could never occur again, since the freak accident 
    had been carefully considered in new designs based on the lessons of 1965. 
    But it did happen again, in 1977, in New York.&quot; A sobering thought in 
    these times.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course Bracken was writing of 
    a simple linear system of coupling between the Soviet Union and the US. What 
    we are seeing now is the onset of a system of multiple, overlapping command 
    and control systems, in a world order increasingly characterised by global 
    vertical and horizontal proliferation. This is very similar to the interacting 
    strategic systems that helped to usher in a catastrophe in 1914. A small perturbation 
    in such a system may indeed lead to a cascading blackout, one that would be 
    permanent for Homo sapiens this time around. It is for good reason that even 
    the people of Canada regard the US as the greatest threat to global peace 
    and security, not to mention the Europeans. The world's leading rouge state 
    can only be successfully deterred from within, by its own population, in what 
    strategic analysts have long called &quot;self deterrence.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The millions of people who marched 
    for peace during the lead up to the invasion of Iraq represent the &quot;civilized 
    part of humanity&quot; and they are determined to prevent the &quot;barbarians 
    from using the ultimate knowledge for the ultimate destruction.&quot; Unlike 
    Krauthammer, they seek to disarm all the barbarians, including the biggest 
    of them all. The prospects for continued human survival largely depend on 
    the success of these popular movements.</font></p>

  ISRAEL URGED TO ABANDON NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br>
  <br>
  Friday 12 December 2003</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> The head of a nuclear watchdog has urged Israel to relinquish its nuclear 
    weapons arsenal as part of a future Middle East peace agreement. Muhammad 
    al-Baradai, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told an Israeli 
    newspaper on Friday that Israel and its neighbours should eliminate all weapons 
    of mass destruction from the region. </p>
  <p>Israel has never officially admitted to having the bomb, and positions itself 
    outside international treaties which would make it subject to inspection. 
    But al-Baradai told the Haaretz daily: &quot;We operate under the assumption 
    that Israel has nuclear arms... Israel has never denied this.&quot; He added 
    there is &quot;a lot of frustration&quot; about Israel's suspected cache, 
    and urged the country to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty - a global pact 
    aimed at stopping the spread of nuclear arms. </p>
  <p>Nuclear treaty...The UN General Assembly and IAEA General Conference have 
    adopted 13 resolutions since 1987 appealing to Israel to join the treaty, 
    but all have been ignored. &quot;My fear is that without such a dialogue, 
    there will be continued incentive for the region's countries to develop weapons 
    of mass destruction to match the Israeli arsenal,&quot; he said. </p>
  <p>Israel's nuclear programme was exposed in 1986 by Israeli nuclear scientist 
    Mordechai Vanunu. After a British newspaper published the revelations, Mossad 
    agents kidnapped Vanunu in Italy and illegally smuggled him back to Israel. 
    He has now spent 17 years in jail, 11 of which were in a tiny solitary confinement 
    cell - and he has just had his appeal for parole denied. Vanunu will stay 
    in jail until 2004, when his term is expected to end.</p>
  <p>Neil Kingsnorth, a spokesman for the London-based Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, 
    said Israel is estimated to have between 100 and 200 nuclear warheads. If 
    deployed, they would be sufficient to obliterate the whole region. &quot;Israel 
    doesn't admit or deny having nuclear weapons, probably for legal reasons. 
    They don't even try to justify having them but it is obviously because they 
    are surrounded by what they perceive as hostile Arab states,&quot; he said. 
    &quot;But having nuclear weapons hasn't prevented Israel being attacked by 
    the Palestinians. I think in the short term the principle of nuclear deterrance 
    might work but in the long term tensions inevitably rise.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Israel should own up to having nuclear weapons and sign the Non-Proliferation 
    Treaty. If countries like Israel set an example, non-nuclear states would 
    lose the incentive to acquire these weapons&quot; However, Kingsnorth said 
    the whole nuclear debate, which is focussing at the moment on Iran's nuclear 
    programme, is replete with hypocrisy. &quot;The US and Great Britian have 
    thousands of nuclear warheads between them but are refusing to give them up. 
    They are trying to make this false distinction between good states that can 
    have nuclear weapons and bad ones who can't. &quot;In practice, the good ones 
    are the ones that are willing to work with them and the bad ones are the ones 
    who are not. I think that is an incredible oversimplification of a complex 
    international situation.&quot;</p>
  <p>He added: &quot;Israel should own up to having nuclear weapons and sign the 
    Non-Proliferation Treaty. If countries like Israel set an example, non-nuclear 
    states would lose the incentive to acquire these weapons. Then we could make 
    strides to nuclear free world.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aljazeera</font><br>

<p align="center">WHAT ABOUT THE WMDs THAT <i>DO</i> EXIST?</p>
<p align="center">By Lawrence S. Wittner</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Now that it's acknowledged by all but hard core supporters of the Bush administration 
    that weapons of mass destruction were nor present in Iraq at the time of the 
    U.S. invasion, IT'S TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT SUCH WEAPONS THAT DO EXIST.</p>
  <p>According to the authoritative Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, THERE ARE 
    MORE THAN 30,000 NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE WORLD TODAY. Eight nations are known 
    to possess them (the United States, Russia, Britain, France, China, India, 
    Pakistan and Israel). And a ninth, North Korea, might have these as well.</p>
  <p>The vast majority of these nuclear weapons are in the hands of the United 
    States and Russia. EACH OF THESE NATIONS MAINTAINS MORE THAN 2,000 OF THEM 
    ON HAIR-TRIGGER ALERT, READY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE TO CREATE A GLOBAL HOLOCAUST 
    IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH.</p>
  <p>EVEN THE MUCH SMALLER NUCLEAR ARSENALS OF THE OTHER NUCLEAR POWERS HAVE THE 
    POTENTIAL TO CAUSE UNIMAGINABLE DESTRUCTION. </p>
  <p>Recognizing the unprecedented danger posed by nuclear weapons, the nations 
    of the world have signed a number of important nuclear arms control and disarmament 
    agreements over the past four decades. These include the Partial test Ban 
    Treaty in 1963, the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 1972, and two Strategic 
    Arms Limitation Treaties, the first in 1972, the second in 1979.</p>
  <p>After a short hiatus occasioned by the revival of the Cold War, they were 
    followed by the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987, two Strategic 
    Arms Reduction Treaties (START I in 1991 and START II in 1993) and the Comprehensive 
    Test Ban Treaty (CTBT in 1996). These agreements limited nuclear proliferation, 
    halted the nuclear arms race and reduced the number of nuclear weapons.</p>
  <p>The linchpin of these agreements is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
    of 1968, in which the non-nuclear signatories agreed to forgo development 
    of nuclear weapons in return for a pledge by the nuclear powers to move toward 
    nuclear disarmament. A few non-nuclear countries, such as India, kept their 
    options open by refusing to sign the treaty. But the overwhelming majority 
    of nations signed the agreement, because they considered it a useful way to 
    reverse the nuclear arms race.</p>
  <p>As late as the year 2000, the parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty promised 
    an &quot;unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear weapons states to accomplish 
    the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals.&quot; This included taking 
    specific steps, such as preserving and strengthening the ABM Treaty and ratifying 
    and putting into force the CTBT.</p>
  <p>Although the U.S. government is a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty--indeed, 
    initiated it and lobbied hard for its acceptance--THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION 
    HAS DECIDED THAT IT WILL NOT BE BOUND BY THE TREATY'S PROVISIONS. IT HAS PULLED 
    OUT OF THE ABM TREATY, AND ACTION THAT ALSO HAS THE EFFECT OF SCRAPPING THE 
    START II TREATY. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO REJECTED THE CTBT AND THIS PAST 
    FALL PUSHED LEGISLATION THROUGH CONGRESS TO BEGIN BUILDING NEW NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
    A resumption of U.S. nuclear testing, halted in 1992, seems in the offing.</p>
  <p>How long other nations will put up with the flouting by the United States 
    of the world's arms control agreements before they resume the nuclear arms 
    race themselves is anybody's guess...BY BUILDING ADDITIONAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
    AND PROVOKING OTHER NATIONS TO DO THE SAME THING, the Bush administration 
    has enhanced the prospect of &quot;loose nukes&quot; becoming available TO 
    TERRORISTS AND OTHER FANATICS...While talking loosely (and misleadingly) of 
    nuclear dangers from &quot;evil&quot; regimes, it has jettisoned the U.S. 
    government's long-standing commitment to nuclear arms control and disarmament. 
    UNLESS THIS POLICY IS REVERSED, THE WORLD FACES DISASTERS OF VAST PROPORTIONS.</p>
