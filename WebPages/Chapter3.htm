  <p><font size="+1">To grasp the meaning of the relationship between Satan and 
    humanity (and particularly Western humanity), one must understand the process 
    of human evolution (and particularly the process of spiritual evolution), 
    from the formation of the material planet, to the eventual creation of the 
    human species (Genesis 1:14-19), and finally to the ongoing creation of the 
    mind of <i>Man</i> itself in our very own time. (The mind of Adam is still 
    being created…Genesis 1:26). Thus to perceive the countenance and the nature 
    of the Dragon (the Devil, Satan), is to engage the Dragon in battle. To not 
    perceive the nature of the Dragon (the Serpent), is to be overcome and devoured 
    by it. Because the Western powers cannot perceive the Dragon's countenance, 
    or understand its nature (in themselves), or the overwhelming effects of its 
    presence in the collective affairs of the world (and Western civilization 
    in particular), they too are preparing to engage it again, but in the wrong 
    kind of battle again (for the third time in this century), and to be overcome 
    and destroyed by it in the end. (See Daniel 2:44,45; Joel, chapter 3)…</font></p>

  earth. And specifically is Europe the head of this great creature, and therefore 
  is European civilization at the head of those events that have been unfolding 
  in the world throughout the 20th century, and which are now unfolding again. 
  We are witnessing in the Balkans, and in the ongoing breakdown of the Russian 
  state of affairs, a continuation of those conditions that led to the First World 
  War, which in turn led to the Second. These in turn are not only leading to 
  the Third, they bringing the 20th century as well as the history of the entire 
  age of Adam to its present and foreordained conclusion. (Revelation 20:1-3; 
  2 Thessalonians 2:1-12). Every Judaeo-Christian nation and institution that

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HOW JIMMY CARTER AND 
  I STARTED THE MUJAHIDEEN</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An Interview with 
  Zbigniew Brzezinski, January, 1998..</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: The former director of the CIA, 
    Robert Gates, stated in his memoirs [&quot;From the Shadows&quot;], that American 
    Intelligence services began to aid the Mujahideen in Afghanistan 6 months 
    before the Soviet Intervention. In this period you were the national security 
    adviser to President Carter. You therefore played a role in this affair. Is 
    this correct?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: Yes. According to the 
    official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahideen began during 1980, 
    that is to say, after the Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec. 1979. But 
    the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely otherwise: Indeed, 
    it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first directive for secret 
    aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, 
    I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion 
    this aid was going to induce a Soviet military invasion. (See 2 Esdras 12:18),</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Despite the risk, you were an 
    advocate of this covert action. But perhaps you yourself desired this Soviet 
    entry into war and looked to provoke it?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: It isn't quite that. 
    We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability 
    that they would.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: When the Soviets justified their 
    intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement 
    of the United States in Afghanistan, people didn't believe them. However, 
    there was a basis of truth. You don't regret anything today?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: Regret what? That secret 
    operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians 
    into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The day that the Soviets 
    officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter: We now have the 
    opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam War. Indeed, for almost 10 years, 
    Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that 
    brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: And neither do you regret having 
    supported the Islamic [<i>integrisme</i>], having given arms and advice to 
    future terrorists?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: What is most important 
    to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? 
    Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of 
    the cold war?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q: Some stirred-up Moslems? But 
    it has been said and repeated: Islamic fundamentalism represents a world menace 
    today.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRZEZINSKI: Nonsense! It is said 
    that the West had a global policy in regard to Islam. That is stupid. There 
    isn't a global Islam. Look at Islam in a rational manner and without demagoguery 
    or emotion. It is the leading religion of the world with 1.5 billion followers. 
    But what is there in common among Saudi Arabian fundamentalism, moderate Morocco, 
    Pakistan militarism, Egyptian pro-Western or Central Asian secularism? Nothing 
    more than what unites Christian countries. </font>(Excerpted from Bill Blum's

<p><font size="+1">The whole of it has initially to do with those events that 
  began in the lower garden of Eden six thousand years ago when the first Adam 
  (those who received the initial revelation of God's Singular Presence in the 
  Universe), went out to convince those around them of the sublime implications 
  of this new insight, concerning the actual--not merely abstract--idea of the 
  Unity of God's Presence in all things. They (Adam--the first Christs) told the 
  people (who were now becoming their church--the first church…Ephesians 5:22-32) 
  that they had nothing to really fear in the world, because in reality nothing 
  really exists in the world but God. (Adam was the first monotheists). They told 
  the people that this One God dwells majestically in every thing, as well as 
  in every living being, and among all the families and tribes of humankind. They 
  explained that there was a creative plan afoot, and as such there was nothing 
  to fear in Nature at all--if only they would bring themselves into conformity 
  with the Mind of Nature itself--with the unfolding revelation of God's Creative 
  Will. (These are the teachings of the Great Tao--the <i>Way of All Things</i>). 
  When is one in conformity with these teachings? with God's Will? When we willingly 
  enter into the process of transformation; when we grow as Nature is teaching 
  us; and when we finally change the garments of fear and doubt that we naturally 
  wear for the garments of faith and trust in the process itself. Thus when we 
  become the living vehicle--the New Body--the New Lodge--through which God is 
  able to carry on the great work of human transformation itself. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Adam instructed this first church that this God (the One God) 
  is, indeed, a God of War, <i>yes that is His Name.</i>..(Exodus 15:3), which 
  is why they must be fearless and faithful in this new endeavor. This was evident 
  by studying the nature of the people and the tribes of people everywhere around 
  them. It was obvious by studying themselves and their own natural inclinations. 
  (Adam's was the first course in spiritual anthropology). But also that they 
  could now change those around them (conquering them as it were, recreating the 
  world as it were), thus alleviating all their own natural fears--not by might 
  and power, however, but by first changing themselves, by humbling themselves 
  before Nature and all others, and by becoming servants and teachers to others 
  instead of adversaries <i>(wise as serpents and HARMLESS as doves </i>they said<i>)</i>. 
  The One God who dwells in all would recognize them when they appeared, and would 
  lay down His arms and welcome them. And yes, what if they were killed in the 
  attempt? There is a hidden world, Adam told them, an upper world, reserved for 
  all of those those who have entered into this process of human transformation. 
  <i>Be of good courage</i>, Adam told them. (The Sermon on the Mount is rooted 
  in these very concepts; as is the great allegorical account of Israel's wars 
  that we know as the Book of Joshua).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Adam instructed this first church how they should also inform 
  others about the paradox of war, how it was through the very process of war 
  itself that God would transform the world, and create &quot;man&quot;. (Which 
  is why all the sacred texts of humankind are about war, and about the secret 
  and spiritual nature of warfare). And thus how all who ceased from the physical 
  and mortal aspects of war would not only enter this new order of humanity but 
  they would also inherit the age to come and the world to come, which God was 
  also creating, and which was already set aside in the heavens of human comprehension 
  for all those who overcame the ways of the lower world. The process would be 
  complete, they said, when <i>man</i> finally arrived at the end of the age (six 
  thousand years later), and when he finally came to the vision of the Most Terrible 
  Countenance of God, <i>THE GOD OF WAR</i>, and when he realized that this God, 
  indeed, will have <i>no other gods before Him.</i>.. (Exodus, chapters 19 and 
  20), (Psalm 82:6-8). The process would be complete when <i>man</i> realized 
  at last what God was creating out of the course husk of the human nature (indeed, 
  out of Themselves)--a new creature, born from above, and for above. Out of the 
  Darkness of the human condition God is creating Light. Out of Chaos God is bringing 
  forth Order; Out of ignorance, understanding; Out of injustice, justice; Out 
  of war, peace. (Isaiah 2:1-4; Micah 4:1-5). But the process would be long. It 
  would be complete when the great Circle was complete, and when <i>man</i> fully 
  realized that all these things, the Light and the Darkness, had to be brought 
  to perfection in what would eventually unfold upon the world in the dimensions 
  of the Mystery of Christ, and that in Christ both the Messiahs (the perfected 
  Adam), and the anti-Messiahs, would finally be revealed. </font></p>

  like Cain, the natural man, and those who were like Abel, the spiritual. The 
  spirit of Cain is of this world, and of this world it speaks. It has grown powerful 
  in the earth, masterminding and manipulating the world in its own darkened interests. 
  It hears the words of the prophets but does not benefit from hearing them (see 
  2 Corinthians 4:3,4). If anything it perverts the word, bending what it hears 
  to suit its own earthly ambitions. It is presently ruling over the affairs of 
  the whole lower, Western order of things…or imagines that it is. (Jeremiah 50:23,24).

  govern the structure and the pattern of all his collective thoughts and activities:</font></p>

  Great Dragon is revealed, says:<i> The God of Peace shall bruise Satan under 
  your feet shortly...</i> (Rom.16:17-20). Every child from here on, being able 
  to see the World Serpent with their own eyes, will be able to make a pilgrimage 
  (if not to Europe itself, then at least in mind), to ritually crush its head

<p><font size="+1">We have often used the example of a hot stove in the corner 
  of a room to comprehend the meaning of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and 
  Evil in the garden of Eden. We say to our children, "Do not touch the stove 
  or you will get burned." The child stands obediently apart from the stove, wondering 
  about the concept of "hot," and what it means to be burned. The wise parent 
  says "Do not touch," but knows that somehow, and in some way, if this child 
  is intelligent, and if it is to grow up with wisdom and understanding, it must 
  touch that stove. It must "disobey" (even unintentionally, or unselfwillfully). 
  It must find a means to touch that stove, if it does not it will never personally 
  know the meaning of hot. It will always have to rely on the experience of others, 
  on others' say-so. (Yet this is also a means. Someone in the group can touch 
  it for all the rest). Without the experience, however, such a soul can, and 
  no-doubt will, remain youthful, and perhaps become a dreadful tattletale, always 
  condemning others for their experiences. It might never, in the greater spiritual 
  scheme of things, come to really know the difference between good and evil, 
  for what is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil but a metaphor for human 
  experience itself. Thus humanity had to partake of it, it had no choice, for 
  the simple reason that experience is the only pathway to spiritual understanding. 
  (See Hebrews 5:10-14). Thus having returned full-circle to the Tree of Life, 
  we now have the ability to look back into history to see both good and evil 
  coming to perfection in our own times. Without the experience we could never 
  have known the difference. We would know nothing of our own propensities for 
  evil, of our own dark side. We would never have known what murder and violence 
  looks like, and our complicity in it; or injustice and oppression, and our complicity 
  in that. Or what the empire of man in its most sophisticated and vainglorious 
  state looks like, thus what WAR is, or its causes and effects. Then having these 
  inclinations still latent and unexposed within us we could never attain to a 
  state of Christ-Consciousness, and therefore could never inherit the age-to-come 
  or the world-to-come. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus in the most personal, and in the very deepest sense, the 
  war against Satan is the war against Self, and against all the lower thought-forms 
  and mental complexities that tend the soul downwards, toward a state of ignorance 
  of the Creative Power, thus toward darkness and death. For we see now that only 
  the children of Darkness, and those who are caught in their sway, make war in 
  the literal sense. They go out in their ignorance to make war against the other 
  powers and principalities of the earth, which are the very same that God has 
  reserved for Himself against the day of battle and war. (Understand Romans 13; 
  Micah 3:5-7; Micah 5:1-5).</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>These are the physical and psychological dimensions of the Tree of Life, 
    and, along with other systems of tantric thought, they are related to the 
    Seven primary levels of human consciousness. They are channels into and out 
    of this realm, and connect the central points of interaction that exist between 
    the individual soul, the outside world, and the presence of God who inhabits 
    all. The soul's task, once it has entered into the mystery of Life, is to 
    explore the darkness, that is to go down into the empire of its own existence, 
    and to engage the lower thought forms (the enemy) and to overcome them wherever 
    they are found. The soul must spend its entire lifetime bringing the faculties 
    of the body and mind into subjection, and in the process illuminating or opening 
    up the chakras to the light of higher reality. When the lowest chakra is subdued--brought 
    under subjection, illuminated--the whole body is full of light, and the mystical 
    union between the Mind of God, and the mind of the individual soul is completed. 
    (Or rather can be completed with the proper alignment of concepts and the 
    right revelations.) The soul's descent into the lowest parts of its own existence 
    is directly analogous in the interior world to the Holy Nation's descent on 
    the historical plane to the lowest, most Western parts of the earth, as it 
    is written: <i>...that they might be called Trees of Righteousness, the planting 
    of the Lord, that He and She might be glorified.</i>.. (Isaiah 61:3). It is 
    to fulfill the words, 'as above so below', <i>On earth as it is in heaven</i>.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The angels are the higher thought-forms that permeate the universe 
  and that dwell in the earth (and, more than just metaphorically, in the East), 
  which when enlisted by the soul not only reveal the presence of the higher realities, 
  but call them into existence when the time requires it. (Understand 2 Thessalonians 
  1:6-9). Satan's angels are the lower thought-forms, but more importantly they 
  are all those who embody these thought-forms, who give them expression, and 
  who we find exercising lordship over the earth in the name of Christ in our 
  time, all in violation of the highest as well as the deepest precepts of Christ. 
  We are referring here to the leaders of the Western world. If they, however, 
  would yield totally to the spiritual implications of our times, and be transformed 
  accordingly by a spiritual renewal of their own minds, they could avert the 
  judgment that is preparing to descend upon them, and upon those who yield to 
  them. If they could repent of their plans to subdue the world, and of their 
  violent attempts to recreate it their own great and colossal fallen interests 
  (and that in the very face of the God of Nature Themselves), and if they would 
  yield to the presence of Adam (the Messiahs who will be revealed to the world 
  in our time…uderstand Ephesians 4:13), they could turn the tide of events that 
  is about to inundate the Western world. (See Ezekiel 33). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Mind of God--Pure Thought--the invisible driving force 
  of the Universe--fills up the whole of reality, above and below, within and 
  without. (Mass =Energy=God). Yet how could Pure Invisible Thought reveal itself 
  to its own creation without also creating a mediator, or a matrix of sensual 
  awareness between itself and the created? Something capable of transmitting 
  the essential concepts of light and darkness, knowledge and ignorance, good 
  and evil, life and death? That mediator is Nature, and more specifically for 
  us in our time, all of Nature as it is expressing itself in the cosmic dimensions 
  of the Tree of Life--the Mystery of Christ. In gnostic terminology it is called 
  "Pleroma," or the "Fullness&quot;...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Which is his Body, the fulness of him that filleth all 
    in all...</i> (Ephesians 1:23). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Just as the spoken word gives intellectual form to the invisible 
  thoughts concealed in the mind of each individual, so the entire Universe, the 
  <i>Word</i>, is the cosmic and visible expression of the invisible thoughts 
  of the Invisible Creators. The "Big Bang" (the Great Emanation), is the beginning 
  of this Divine Expression. Every visible, or comprehensible form is an expression 
  of some inner, or invisible principle of divine reality. It is contained in 
  the Law of Correspondences. Every thing means something else. Thus Paul says, 
  <i>Study to show thyself approved.</i> The more one studies the more one understands. 
  If such contemplation is accompanied by reverence and devotion to God (that 
  is, to all of Life itself), God will be revealed. God is all that exists. God 
  did not merely create the Universe, but transformed Him and Herself into the 
  Universe itself. (And bah to those who contend that such ideas devolve to nature 
  worship, leaving God beyond our true focus. As someone once said, the children 
  of God shall be one with God long after the material universe has disappeared, 
  after all things have been transformed back into their spiritual essence). Instead, 
  such ideas bring about a deep and awesome reverence for the very earthly environment 
  in which we live and breath, and have our being. Such a realization--for realization 
  is the fruit of our spiritual existence--brings about the changes that are necessary 
  for the healing and restoration of both our own souls and the world at large. 
  (See Revelation 22:1-5). In fact we absolutely cannot attain to the truly spiritual 
  life without also seeing that all things are of the Spirit, or that all is God, 
  or rather that God is All). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We will have more to say of the Divine Mother, the Feminine 
  Principle of the Godhead, but suffice it to say here that when the Universe 
  as we perceive it came into existence, that which was united in Itself before 
  the event was now divided in Two: that part of God which remained hidden beyond 
  the vail of Creation, and that part of God that is revealed in Creation. The 
  gravitational force, transmitted via the gauge particles of time itself, is 
  an expression of this reality, the attraction of matter to a universal, invisible 
  center. The electro-magnetic field (light) is another expression of this reality, 
  with its constant negative and positive interaction. We can understand the meaning 
  in the true, life-giving, loving relationship and attraction every Male and 
  Female has for each other (that is, in the relationship they should eventually 
  have for one another when they are finally made in the image of God…when She 
  is his goddess, and He is her lord). We, our minds and our bodies, were born 
  in that moment of Creation. We are made of the same forces, the same particles 
  of matter, and the same dimensions of reality as everything else in the universe, 
  as the stars and planets, as the wind and waves, as the trees and the plants, 
  as all the rest of life on earth. We are those things. As we penetrate deeper 
  into the structure of reality we can see it. Just as the Universe itself is 
  a Divine Living Being, whose entire form we can only speculate about at the 
  moment, so we ourselves (our true selves), are made up of the same. All we can 
  see of each other is the form, the image of the Higher worlds, in which each 
  of us are presently clothed. But we can not see our true selves yet (or what 
  we really look like) not here in these dimensions anyway. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Nor was there any more economical way for God to instruct us 
  in these things, and achieve the same results, than to show them to us, and 
  to let us experience it all for ourselves. That is, there was no more efficient 
  way to create &quot;man,&quot; and preserve heaven intact, than to set these 
  dimensions apart from the higher world, so that we could see what heaven is 
  not. But also to show us how the material world, which is filled with nothing 
  but God, will rise up again, and again, if humanity decides (after it has been 
  set free from this present state of reality) to exercise again the unrighteousness 
  and injustice that it is capable of, which has been clearly demonstrated to 
  us throughout the history of this age. This great spirit of Darkness has been 
  demonstrated not only to us but in us. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And then, just as Satan is not, in the human sense, one single 
  individual being who ever walked the earth at any one particular time in history, 
  we must come to the corresponding realization that the Mystery of Christ, as 
  it is expressed on the cosmic limbs of the World Tree, and in the Gospels, is 
  not an account of the life of any one single individual human being either. 
  But rather it is an epic and archetypal account of God's Presence in the sum 
  of all human events. One that, though it has made itself known to humanity at 
  various other times, and in various other ways, has made itself known in a vivid 
  way, with great historical effects, over the course of this present age. It 
  is the expression of the Universal Higher Consciousness, the counterpart of 
  the darkened, lower state of mind. The two have been traveling together in the 
  same Body. The Scriptures are stories, not about individuals but about principles 
  and ideas, about archetypes, about God/Nature revealing Him and Herself/itself 
  in the context of historical events. And only after that is it about certain 
  individuals who have entered the story, and who for historical reasons have 
  become one with it--in ways, however, that are common to us all, with all the 
  same infirmities and shortcomings as ourselves. In other words, individuals 
  who are not to be thought more highly of than any other, as Paul himself lamented, 
  <i>chief among sinners</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Nevertheless, by nature of their calling, those who were called 
  up into the mystery (being possessed by it as it were--avitars as they are elsewhere 
  called), became able to interpret the oracles of Nature. They also learned how 
  to seal up their interpretations, or revelations, until the last days. See how 
  the Feet of the mystery lie here in the West, in the lower regions of the earth,

<p><font size="+1"> Eurigena was an 8th century mystic and adept of Kabbalah. 
  In a commentary on his sense of John the Baptist's saying: <i>He it is who coming 
  after me, is preferred before me, whose Shoelatchet I am not worthy to loose,</i> 
  it is stated:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div align="left"></div>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;One may say the Christ's 
    shoes signify (both) visible creation and scripture, for in these he has fixed 
    his traces as though with his feet. Visible creation is truly the garment 
    of the Word since, manifesting his Beauty to us, it makes him known openly; 
    and sacred scripture has also become his garment because it contains his mysteries. 
    Of these two realities- creation and scripture-the precursor considers himself 
    unworthy to loose the latchet, that is, the subtlety. The Two Feet of the 
    Word are, on the one hand, the natural ratio of visible creation and, on the 
    other hand, the spiritual meaning of sacred scripture. The first is cloaked 
    by the sensible forms of the sensible world, the second by the outer shell 
    of the divine letters, that is, by sacred scripture. In two ways, then, have 
    commentators on the Divine Law unveiled the incarnation of the Word of God. 
    According to the first they teach that he was incarnated in the Virgin (the 
    undefiled mind), joining himself to human nature in the unity of his substance. 
    According to the other they assert that this same Word is as if incarnated, 
    that is, thickened, by letters and shapes and lines of visible things. The 
    latchet of the Double-shoe, which the precursor felt unworthy to loose, is 
    diligent research and minute investigation of the truth in this two-fold manner. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus there is an equivalence between 
    nature and the scripture. The Word is equally present in both, and both are 
    in equal measure the Word of God. Both are signs of God or gestures evoking 
    divine principles. Both evoke meaning and permit its realization.&quot; </font>Eurigena,

    the exile of Israel is connected to the sins of Adam, the outcome of which 
    was the scattering of the holy sparks, both of the Shekinah and of Adam's 
    soul. When the sparks became diffused even further in Adam's descendants, 
    the mission of gathering them and raising them up, that is, of preparing the 
    way for redemption, was awarded to Israel. The exile is not, therefore, merely 
    a punishment and a trial but is a mission as well. The Messiah will not come 
    until the good in the universe has been completely winnowed out from the evil, 
    for in Vital's words 'the ingathering of the exiles itself means the gathering 
    of all the sparks that were in exile.' The exile may be compared to a garden

    Structure of the Sefirot reaches the Feet; thus the souls that go forth in 
    the Footsteps of Messiah are unusually obdurate and resistant to <i>Tikkun</i>,

    of Dieudonne de Gozen, a medieval Grand Master of the Knights of St. John 
    at Rhodes who, according to legend, slew the dragon of Malpasso. 'It makes 
    no difference,' writes Eliade, 'that the genuine historical record concerning 
    him is innocent of dragons; the mere fact that the man was, in popular imagination, 
    a hero, necessarily identified him with a category, an archetype, which entirely 
    disregarded his real exploits, equipped him with a mythical biography from 
    which it was impossible to omit combat with a reptilian monster.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We may say much the same of Jesus 
    of Nazareth…Moreover, I shall use the word 'fiction' rather than the word 
    'myth' to refer to the study contained in this book, of the fictional aspects 
    of the Four Canonical Gospels. BY FICTION I MEAN--TO PUT THE MATTER IN THE 
    SIMPLEST TERMS AT THE OUTSET--A NARRATIVE WHOSE PURPOSE IS LESS TO DESCRIBE 
    THE PAST THAN AFFECT THE PRESENT. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, all works of fiction 
    have an element of history, all works of history have an element of fiction…And 
    it is not my purpose here to articulate a quarrel with Christian faith, or 
    to call evangelists liars, or to assert that the Gospels have no historical 
    content. I write as a literary critic, not as a debunker. THE GOSPELS ARE, 
    IT MUST BE SAID WITH GRATITUDE, WORKS OF ART, THE SUPREME FICTION IN OUR CULTURE… 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The canonical gospels exist as 
    a sequence of narrative and dramatic scenes. This is not surprising; how else 
    would one tell the story of Jesus? What is surprising is the great differences 
    among the stories…For example, according to Matthew and Mark, the dying words 
    of Jesus were, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' According to Luke, 
    Jesus' dying words were, 'Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.' But 
    according to John, they were, 'It is accomplished.' To put it another way, 
    we cannot know what the dying words of Jesus were, or even whether he uttered 
    any; it is not that we have too little information, but that we have too much. 
    Each narrative implicitly argues that the others are fictional… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The matter becomes even more complex 
    when we add to it the virtual certainty that Luke knew perfectly what Mark 
    had written…and the liklihood that John also knew what Mark and perhaps Luke 
    wrote, but both Luke and John chose to tell the story differently. AS IT HAPPENS, 
    ALL THE DEATH SCENES WERE CONSTRUCTED TO SHOW JESUS DYING THE MODEL DEATH 
    AND DOING SO IN FULFILLMENT OF THE SCRIPTURES… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What this means I shall discuss 
    later, but for now suffice it that the scenes have a religious and moral purpose 
    disguised as a historical one; we are, with these scenes, in a literary realm 
    known as fiction, in which narratives exist less to describe the past than 
    to affect the present. In De Quincy's phrase, THE GOSPELS ARE NOT SO MUCH 
    LITERATURE OF KNOWLEDGE AS LITERATURE OF POWER. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As in the case mentioned above, 
    the content of the Gospels is frequently not 'Jesus' but what certain persons 
    in the first century wanted us to think about 'Jesus.' In the language of 
    the Fourth Gospel, 'Those (narratives) here written have been recorded in 
    order that you may hold the faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.' 
    (John 20:31). In the language of literary criticism, the Gospels are self-reflexive; 
    they are not about Jesus so much as they are about their own attitudes concerning 
    Jesus. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That reflexive aspect of the Gospels 
    is one of the main themes of this book. I deal with the effort of the evangelists 
    to present their works to us as self-conscious literary documents, deliberately 
    composed as the culmination of a literary and oral tradition, echoing and 
    recasting that tradition, both appealing to it and transcending it, while 
    using it in multiple ways. </font></p>

    the earthly person(s) of the Redeemer. The 'heavenly Christ,' or Higher Self, 
    is to be understood as always associated with the struggling Lower Self symbolized

    the Christian Gospels. They have laid down their lives for the sins of many.&quot;

<div align="left"><font size="+1">The scriptures speak of two deaths, and two 
  resurrections. (See Revelation 20:6). The first death is the death of the old 
  nature, the old intellect, the old logic, and the old way of interpreting the 
  scriptures and the designs of Nature. It is as Paul wrote: <i>Know ye not that 
  so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</i> 
  (Rom. 6:3). And then, <i>If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which 
  are above.</i> (Colossians 3:1). The Scriptures also say: <i>The kingdom of 
  God is spread out upon the earth and men do not see it.</i> (Gospel of Thomas, 
  113). Seeing it now, and how it is coming to perfection in the hearts and minds 
  of all the children of Light in this age, and more specifically here at the 
  Western ends of the earth, we can also see that "hell" is not a place that the 
  soul can go to after the death of the physical body, but rather it is a place, 
  and a state of mind, one recognizes after submitting to the first death. Hell 
  is right here in this world. It symbolizes the whole lower state of mind into 
  which we have fallen, and more particularly the Western state of mind into which 
  we have fallen in our own time… </font></div>

<div align="left"><font size="+1">By following the allegorical and archetypal

  in the Genesis account is not a figure of the female gender at all, but of the 
  entire congregation, Adam's church…see Ephesians 5:30-32), was not beguiled 
  by some extraterrestrial spirit fallen from heaven, or even some exterior force 
  (not exactly), but was overcome by "her" (and we mean "their") very own nature. 
  It rose up in them in the symbolic form of the serpent. They (the church of 
  that time) were beguiled by their own rationale, by their own earthly concerns, 
  their fears and doubts, and by their own lack of direct knowledge, that is, 
  by their own lack of a direct experience of God. They were beguiled by the sum 
  of their own natural impulses, the impulse they all shared for physical well-being 
  and self-survival. How could they fully understand what Adam was trying to tell 
  them? How could they trust such a notion--the idea of non-violence--in the face 
  of others who did not share such an idea? Adam was asking them to abandon the 
  lower side of the Tree--that side of the Tree which presented them with prerogatives 
  reserved for God alone, not simply judgments between good and evil (which most 
  men are clearly incapable of...see Isaiah 5:20-25; Malachi 3:15-18...KJV), but 
  the exercise of corporal power in such matters, resulting in the life or death 
  of other men. In essence, Adam was directing them to give up the thought of 
  their own self-defense, as well as the exercise of authority over others, something 
  that Adam's God was not requiring of any other people on earth but them...</font></div>

<p><font size="+1">Having returned full-circle to this first experience in the 
  garden, we see that the account of it in Genesis is a prophecy of our own times. 
  We see that Eve (the Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, church), is still beguiled 
  (although <i>she</i> has brought forth many children who are not…see 1 Timothy 
  2:15). <i>She</i> is still listening to the voice of the serpent, entangled 
  as <i>she</i> is in the age-ending affairs of this world, and more particularly 
  in the age-ending affairs of the American nation. <i>She</i> imagines that America 
  is the most righteous nation of all, not because the true Light is being born 
  out of the American experience but because it offers <i>her</i>, beyond all 
  other nations, a sense of material prosperity and well-being, and the military 
  protection that assures it--but who is, as we shall see, the Eighth and last 
  world-empire to hold the oracles of God and the mind of the people of God captive.

  world mysteries, one that was given to it at the Council of Nicea in 367 AD 
  and afterwards. This Council was presided over by one of histories most noted 
  sons of Darkness, Constantine the Great. When Christianity endeared itself to 
  this earthly champion, it endeared itself to the spirit of antichrist itself, 
  a spirit which has grown up in the church, and with the church, to finally occupy 
  the office of the Presidency of the United States in the 20th century. In so 
  doing the church paid no heed at all to the words which said: <i>Ye adulterers 
  and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with 
  God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God...</i>(James

    Thus it can not realize that where it says: <i>And they worshipped the dragon

    unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?</i> (Revelation 13:4), that 
    it refers, first of all, to themselves, to Western man's worship of the <i>collective 
    will</i>, of the common intellect of the people themselves, which in one great 
    misguided way or another gives it power to the beast--in this case the American 
    government). How? Simply by participating with it and its institutions (in 
    direct violation of the precepts of Christ). Thus it cannot see how by nature 
    of its historic participation in the world order (or dis-order), that it refers 
    in our time to the church's relationship with the Western, and more particularly 
    the American political and economic system of things. And even more specifically 
    to its relationship with the office of the American Presidency. The United

    the outer realities of the physical plane. Once imprisoned we begin unknowingly 
    to call <i>good evil, and evil good.</i>..(Isaiah 5:20-23). We lose our ability 
    to perceive the Presence of God in all things, and begin to serve the spirit 
    of antichrist within ourselves instead of Christ. We endear ourselves to the 
    lie instead of the truth, to darkness instead of light, to ignorance as it 
    opposes knowledge, to death instead of life, in other words to the spirit 
    of Cain instead of Abel... </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Are they not both sons of one Mother--the Church? But Cain

    God, can find it in their hearts to kill another human being, or who encourages 
    or allows others to kill human beings on their behalf--no matter what the 
    reason. The more Cain kills, the more God kills back. The more Cain steals, 
    the more God steals back. It is as simple and as terrible as that. To stop 
    the killing, stop killing. To end injustice, end injustice. To end war, end 
    war. But Cain is incapable. So the drama continues, onwards to the plains 
    of Armageddon. (See Revelation 16:16). Armageddon is not some place or event 
    that is confined to the Middle East, but an event of world-wide proportions, 
    one that will culminate in the fiery judgment (one way or another) of the 
    United States of America. (See Revelation, chapter 18; also Luke 12:49,50). 
    It will signal the end of this age and the beginning of the age-to-come. It 
    will be accompanied by a shift from the present paradigm, symbolized by our 
    situation at the Seventh Sefirot on the Tree of Life, to the emerging state 
    of consciousness, symbolized by those events that will take place around the 
    Eighth Sefirot named Majesty. The true Messiahs will be revealed there in 
    our time. But presently the office of the President of the United States, 
    and those who have occupied it, and the whole earthly order over which it 
    presides, stands in the way and takes the place of the true Messiahs in the 
    hearts and minds of the people. <a href="../UsedImages/ChristMystery.gif">See

<p><font size="+1">The children of Light were not intended to have any king, or 
  president, or any earthly power ruling over them in this age other than the 
  Spirit of God. (See Deuteronomy 17:14-20; Judges 9:7-15; 1 Samuel 8: 1-22; Luke 
  20:26; Romans 6:12-16). The American experience was the opportunity God provided 
  to fulfill these commandments. The true Remnant in every age, though recognizing 
  the reason for the presence of earthly powers--so that in them the Darkness 
  itself could be revealed; so that through them God could keep the Darkness in 
  check; and so that in them God could reveal how He rises up in the world to 
  overthrow the Darkness (see Romans 9:17-23)--never recognized any as ruling 
  over them. They never swore by them, or payed allegiance to them. Nor did they 
  ever participate in the political processes of these nations, as it is written: 
  <i>All nations before Him are as nothing, and are counted to Him as less than 
  nothing, and vanity.</i>..(Isaiah 40:15-17). It is the Lord who sets up kings 
  and removes kings, or presidents, even though here in the West the people may 
  be under the illusion that it is themselves. (Daniel 2:21). Thus the Remnant 
  in every age has always walked apart from the confusion, the calamity, the violence, 
  and the illusions of the world, balancing as best they could, when they could, 
  the command to <i>be separate</i> with the other commands to be involved, to 
  instruct the world, and to both serve and rescue the poor and oppressed from 
  the hands of the oppressor. They have always known, however, that to be a friend 
  of this world-order is ultimately to be an enemy of the things that God is bringing 
  to pass in the earth. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">James Toler, a feisty local columnist, and free lance writer, 
  said it another way, in an article in the Charleston, West Virginia, Gazette:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This nation was founded by 
    a bunch of money-grubbing colonists who nearly exterminated the native population 
    because the Indians would not live like 'civilized' white men. They built 
    the South on the backs of black slaves and poor whites.. The North built its 
    commerce on children and immigrants who worked from daylight to dark, were 
    poorly fed and paid, and whose only reward was to die young. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesus Christ was the same fellow

    would have any truck with the likes of...that gang of thugs who run Washington,

<p><font size="+1">In a work of inestimable value entitled <i>Paradise Lost and 
  the Rise of the American Republic</i> (which we shall open alongside of the 
  pages of the book of Isaiah), Lydia Dittler Schulman--in her treatment (from 
  a Miltonian world-view) of the rise of English capitalism in America; the glorification 
  of individual initiative, ingenuity and inventiveness; Adam Smith's cult of 
  self-interest versus the real common good; the subsequent and wholesale disregard 
  for the natural and social environment; and the complete privatization of resources, 
  capital and the means of production--encompasses the entire meaning of the verses 
  which say: <i>For the Mystery of Iniquity doth already work...</i>(2 Thess. 
  2:1-7). "The story," Schulman says, "encapsulates the problem of corruptibility, 
  the choice between good and evil, and the question, or the illusion of free 
  will." (Please see I Corinthians 15:53,54).</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they 
    allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The connection between Schulman's work and the book of Isaiah, 
  which we shall begin to open up during the events of the America Revolution, 
  must be emphasized again. And as such we will see that the story of Lucifer's 
  fall from heaven at Isaiah, chapter 14, is not simply a cosmic myth, or a tale 
  of some time in the way-distant past when Satan and his minions were cast out 
  of some extra-terrestrial realm, but rather it is a prophecy which culminates 
  in the events of our times. It is a proverb to be taken up against the world-ruler, 
  the king of Babylon, in the last day. (Please consider the chapter in the Addendum 
  entitled The Mystery of Iniquity). Is he not called the <i>Son of the Morning</i>?...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> It is a proverb to be taken up against the sons of Darkness 
  who have come across the times with the children of Light in the Mystery of 
  Christ--all of whom will be exposed, and cast out for all the world to see, 
  along with the Great Serpent itself. (Open the Book of Jude). Those who cannot 
  see the Serpent, are of the Serpent; and those who are ready to rush head-long 
  into the events that are at this moment unfolding in the Balkans, (and now in 
  Central Asia), are rushing head-long into the great wide-opened mouth of the 
  Dragon itself, to be devoured at last in the age-ending events of our time.

    EARTH WITH THEIR OWN DARK DEEDS)<b>, </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">while 
    de-emphasizing individual responsibility for the consequence of actions, may 
    render its adherents susceptible to manipulation by evil-intentioned Satans. 
    The appeal…of Satan to Eve's sensual desires and his insistence on the inconsequentiality 
    of her actions in the larger framework of the universe is suggestive of the 
    way a demagogue might manipulate a crowd, playing on its sense of political 
    impotence and unjust treatment, while promising to gratify its immediate desires. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Satan's rhetorical skills are an 
    even more prominent feature in <i>Lucifer</i>, Vondel's drama of rebellion 
    in Heaven. Lucifer at first conceals his own rebellious intentions while drawing 
    out the festering resentments of the more egotistical members of the angelic 
    population. When the incited mob finally demands that he lead them in rebellion 
    against the tyrant God, Lucifer showers them with false-republican speeches…&quot; 
    (p.23). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Lucifer is a familiar type: 
    a self-serving political leader who camouflages his egotistical aims behind 
    altruistic rhetoric. His flaws are the typical satanic ones: pride, envy, 
    ambition, jealousy. He stirs up the rebellion in Heaven with 'cunning hatched 
    from subtlety.'…&quot; (p.24). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But if Lucifer's rebellion 
    is portrayed as egotism parading under the pretext of selfless public service 
    and respect for the law, (Lucifer's grievance against God is that he has violated 
    his own celestial hierarchy in creating and elevating 'man'), God is not portrayed 
    as a 'conservative,' nor is the universe he created a static hierarchy…Lucifer 
    rebels, not because he wants change, but because he wants to preserve his 
    original place in the celestial hierarchy, which God himself is changing and 
    perfecting…&quot; (p.24). </font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Lucifer, the stateholder, 
    clings to the old order even if it means war, while God unfolds his infinitely

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Moloch, the furious king

  violence and warfare itself--did not afterwards receive direct permission from 
  God (his god) to join the revolt, and to exact a full measure of righteous vengeance

  did (and that the god he prayed to for guidance was naturally the same God that 
  Jesus prayed to; for after all, haven't we been told all this time that America 
  is a Christian nation)? Thus the message, relayed so effectively through the

  nation, and the American military establishment to which the nation owes its

  one that is leading to a new age--an age of Righteousness, Justice and true 
  Peace. It is being born in the hearts and minds of millions of individuals in 
  our time (throughout the whole world now). It is being born in the same way 
  as this present age was born two thousand years ago, in the minds of those who 
  could perceive the Signs of the Times in their generation. (See John 16:20,21). 
  Everything, therefore, that the church does in support of the old order of things 
  (even more so when it refers to itself as a New World Order), intensifies the 
  meaning of the text. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As we see how the "skull," or the "mind" of the Dragon lies 
  under, or rather how it comprises the continent of Europe, thus how it is intricately

    of the nations, the chief among them is the king of Grecia…&quot;</font><b> 
    </b>The Dead Sea Scriptures, by T.Gaster, p.76<b>.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Who is this king of Grecia? One might imagine it to be some 
  past reference to Alexander the Great (see Daniel 8:21-227), which it is, but 
  only in part. One must interpret every prophetic text in the light of the growing 
  and unfolding dimensions of the World Mystery (all of which will culminate in 
  America where all the books will be opened in the last day). One must understand 
  how the Seven heads of the World Serpent are the Seven world empires that span 
  the earth from one side of the Mystery to the other, from their origins in Eden, 
  to the East, and back to Eden again; whose center, however, is the city of DaViD 
  itself, situated in the center of the World Tree in the center of Europe...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>The Seven heads of the Great World Serpent...Psalm 74:12-14.</b></p>
<p><font size="+1"> We speak of these things in the chapter on the Nature and 
  the Mark of the Beast, but one must begin to see how the spirit of each empire 
  was assimilated into the one that followed it (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Media-Persia, 
  Grecia, Rome...<a href="SideLinks/DragonAndJerusalem.htm">see Revelation 17:10)</a>, 
  each rising in its turn to take the mind of the Holy Nation captive, and then 
  falling under the rise of the one that followed. They arrive at the collective 
  peak of their political, economic, military and social development at the center 
  of the Mystery with the Holy Roman Empire and the modern nation-states of Europe. 
  The Holy Roman Empire, the Seventh Head of the Dragon, was brought to ruin before 
  our very eyes as God rose up against it in the World Wars of the 20th century--but 
  not before the mind of Europe sailed away to the West, to America, carrying 
  the spirits of all Seven with it back to the beginning again (see Matthew 12:43-45), 
  to become the Eighth and last, and the greatest empire to enslave and entangle 
  the Word of God in it own service. (See Revelation 17:7-14)… </font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><i>For, lo, I will command and I will sift the house of Israel

<p><font size="+1">The epic is complete as the children of Israel finally learn 
  what it means to overcome the world. It begins with the Self, for the war against 
  Self is the only battle the children of Light have ever been commissioned to 
  engage in. And then only after that may the children of light make war against 
  the world, and only then in the most strictest, non-violent and allegorical 
  way. (See 2 Corinthians 10:3-6). The epic is complete as Israel learns how to 
  lift its eyes above its own fallen condition, to view the terrible panorama 
  of spiritual reality--the history of the world--in a single glance, and when 
  it realizes that what the natural mind has mistaken for good, God has set aside 
  for evil. (Understand Malachi 3:18; Luke 16:15). It is not that America acts 
  in completely worse ways than the other nations, it is just that all the evil 
  it has worked in the world it has done in the name and in the spirit of Christ 
  (and conversely, the good that America is noted for in the world, the idea of 
  <i>Freedom </i> for instance, it has stolen, or conscripted from the Word of 
  God that inhabits its shores). God has warned, and warned, and warned through 
  the voice of all the prophets that They will have none of it. For two-thousand 
  years They have warned. From the beginnings of the American nation God has been 
  warning. Through the voice and the songs of the oppressed everywhere throughout 
  the earth They have warned. America has been saturated with warnings. And now 
  They must act, or rather the Father must act, as He rises up in all of the Powers, 
  as well as in all of the conflicts of the East as it is written:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">God demands social and economic justice, not just talk of it; 
  and They demand it most of all of those who are being brought to perfection 
  here at the Western ends of the earth. They demand that those who take the name 
  of Christ walk in all of the ways of Christ, in the absolutely non-violent ways 
  of that Name itself. When the church came to these shores it was already "free" 
  (free to do good, and free to live apart from the sons of Darkness as servants 
  of the Word of God...1 Peter, chapter 2). It needed no other laws, and no other 
  champions to set it more free than it already was. Anything more was evil. The 
  epic will be complete when the Holy Nation discovers how it has been bowing 
  down to images all these centuries, to idols and images of the truth but not 
  the truth itself; and when it learns to lift up its voice with the remnant of 
  this generation, decrying the spirit of Antichrist that surrounds and rules 
  over it. </font></p>

    Reality has no opposite. It is non-dual, and the soul is delivered from suffering

<p><font size="+1">It is the spirit of Satan in us that keeps us from coming to

  as America's growing and fated involvement in the Balkan crisis (and now we 
  see the picture even more clearly as God invites the the present Bush administration 
  and all its allies up to meet Him in the heart of Eurasia itself...Isaiah 30:25,26; 
  Joel 3:9-16...and now in the Middle east). It is Satan in us that will convince 
  us to break through the bounds that God told Moses to set between the Mountain 
  and the people,<i> that they go not up into the mount when the Lord descends 
  upon it…for they shall surely be put to death...</i> (Exodus 19:11-13). It is

  "a valiant man," or "warrior." It appears from the root meaning "to be strong, 
  to prevail, act insolently, be great, be mighty, strengthen, be stronger." It 
  is indicative of God's revelation of Himself in the East. It is a revelation 
  of God's power and might. God revealed Himself in this manner to all of the 
  adepts of the Eastern world in ancient times: </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">However, it is also written: <i>Not by might, not by power, 
  but by my Spirit saith the Lord...</i>(Zechariah 4:6). God may rule by Power, 
  but we may not. But who can understand it? Who can interpret it? Those who have 
  completed the spiritual pilgrimage, not only to the West in these times but 
  at last to the perfected spiritual state of mind. It is those who can perceive 
  the awesome Presence of the Lord stretched out upon the limbs of the Cosmic 
  World Tree, in the present sum of all human events. It is those who can understand 
  the words: <i>And they shall look upon me </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
  Lord of All)</font><font size="+1"><i> whom they have pierced...</i>(Zechariah 
  12:10); and those which say: <i>I am he that liveth, and was dead, and, behold, 
  I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and death.</i>..(Revelation 
  1:18).</font></p>

    seeking until they find. When they find they will be Troubled. When they become

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The name Michael, <i>MYK-El</i>, derives from three Hebrew 
  terms, <i>Miy</i>, <i>Kiy</i>, and <i>El</i>. <i>Miy</i> is a general pronoun 
  used for persons (not things), any (person), he, him, her, who(soever) would 
  to God (who is <i>El</i>). <i>Kiy</i> is a prepositional prefix (linking one 
  thought to the next) indicating causal relationships of all kinds ("forasmuch, 
  inasmuch, nevertheless, since, surely, then, therefore, though, until, when, 
  whether, while, yet.") Thus the term is subjective in nature. It indicates a 
  transformation from outer forms to inner. It leaves the literal sense of things 
  by qualifying every interpretation with "therefore, then, though, yet." "Though 
  it says that, yet it means this." </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">THE NUMBER 666</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We have treated the subject of the Number and the Mark of the 
  Beast in another chapter in this book, but we do not want to pass out of this 
  chapter without associating it with the words: <i>Now the serpent was more subtle 
  than any beast of the field.</i>..(see Genesis 3:1). The Beast and the Serpent 
  are, in the earthly sense, the same spirit, both a description of the political 
  and religious realities of our own time, but neither of them are so foolish 
  as to literally imprint or otherwise encode a number upon the Foreheads or the 
  Right Hands of its subjects. (Revelation 13:16,17). The Beast has plenty of 
  christian counselors explaining to them that this is a big taboo. But few are 
  wise enough to see that this <i>Mark</i> is already imprinted everywhere, in 
  the thought patterns and in the works and political deeds of the whole American 
  populace. Its presence is so pervasive that we do not even see it and accept 
  its affects as normal social and religious behavior. For as the kingdom of God 
  comes without observation, so has the realm of Antichrist. (see Luke 17:20; 
  1 Thessalonians 5): </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts 
    be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, 
    and so that day come upon us unawares. </i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell 
    on the face of the whole earth.</font></i><font size="+1">.. (Luke 21:34,35).

<p><font size="+1">Because the spiritual nation of Israel was given no actual 
  land in this age (nor in any age past, present, or future), but was made to 
  wander in types and images through the wilderness of the other nations until 
  the real Promise should dawn upon it on the Day of Redemption (see Genesis 17:7,8; 
  Hebrews 11:8-16; Deuteronomy 8), we must interpret the term<i> land</i> to mean 
  <i>state of mind</i>: for the human body itself is the only "land" over which 
  a child of Light is allowed to rule with authority, and this means "one's own 
  mind, and one's own body, and not another's."</font></p>

<p> <font size="+1">The <i>Mark of the Beast </i> is everywhere. It is the <i>mark 
  </i> that God placed on Cain because of his violence to his brother Abel. One, 
  in fact, cannot find legal employment in Cain's empire, America, if they cannot 
  produce two forms of documentation proving that they are either citizens of 
  this country (thus participants in its social, political, economic and military 
  world view), or otherwise allowed to be here. If one does not have the commandments 
  and precepts of God emblazoned foremost in their minds they will rehearse the 
  precepts and the philosophies of fallen men instead, and they will participate 
  in them. Likewise, if one does not greet another with the word of God, or with 
  their hands perform the work of God (and if one has become unable to interpret 
  the meaning of the <a href="../UsedImages/pg547.gif">Right Hand of Power</a>), 
  then one will not only extend the hand of ignorance and error to others at every 
  meeting, but they will find themselves subject to the power of violent men instead, 
  and will perform the works of men, as the children of Israel are in America 
  today. <i>My people are in captivity because they have no knowledge.</i>.. (Isaiah 
  5:13), translates into &quot;My people do not even know they are in captivity." 
  Such is the subtle nature and the influence of Satan. </font></p>

    each other they always resemble the old snake, each drawing to its side, anxious 
    for self preservation. Freedom from the snake's anguish can only be had by 
    ceasing from the snake's ways, and learning to obey the laws of love, the
