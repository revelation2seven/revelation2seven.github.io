<p><font size="+1">This Introduction was prompted by a criticism of an earlier, 
  hurried attempt (in the mid 1980s) to put these ideas into a written and comprehensible 
  form. </font><font size="+1">As then, it continues an attempt to emphasize (from 
  the left side of the Oracle--the side of Wisdom, Love, and Endurance) that, 
  as we have been drawing closer, over the course of the twentieth century, to 
  those events that signal the great day of the Lord, we have at last arrived 
  at them. That is, we have arrived at a time of Revelation. As we "open the books" 
  and begin to compare the hidden, underlying meanings of sacred scripture with 
  the mysterious, unfolding realities of our own time, we may even behold the 
  very Countenance of God itself. It is revealed majestically in the sum of every 
  present natural and human event. It is revealed, of course in the whole history 
  of the world, but more terribly in the events of the 20th century, and now even 
  more perfectly in the events that surround us everywhere, and in those things 
  that are about to come to pass.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ezekiel (the son of man) 
    was hardly the first to gain a direct glimpse at the heavenly powers. As far 
    back as the time of the Israelite king Ahab, nearly three hundred years before, 
    Micah had been granted a vision of the heavenly court, with God seated, surrounded 
    by an angelic council. And in the time of Hezekiah, just over a century before, 
    the prophet Isaiah had described the appearance of winged cherubs in the Divine 
    Presence, endlessly chanting hymns of praise. Ezekiel's vision, however, was 
    not one of static majesty but rather of a mobile, world-conquering divinity, 
    supported by Four bizarre figures propelled by fiery &quot;wheels,&quot; and 
    blazing above an icy ceiling into the limitless depths of the sky...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>Exodus 24:10; Ezekiel, chapter 1.</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For centuries Jewish sages and 
    mystics have read and studied the enigmatic words of Ezekiel's description, 
    convinced that here was an eyewitness account of a close encounter with God. 
    Scholars have speculated on the meaning of the prophet's words and the accuracy 
    of the description--and the uncanny resemblance of many of its features to 
    the gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon. Yet the stance and hymns of the winged 
    figures supporting the Divine Chariot became models for a unique new mode 
    of prayer and meditation. And, as we shall see, those heavenly figures--called 
    in Hebrew, <i>seraphim, cherubim, and ofanim--</i>were ultimately regarded 
    as metaphysical intercessors for the prayers and requests of humanity. Yet 
    at the core of the vision was an astute political warning. As the exiles spoke 
    of the coming triumphs over the Egyptians and the independent Judean people, 
    EZEKIEL KNEW THAT EVEN GREATER DISASTERS LOOMED BEFORE THEM. HE HAD LIVED 
    THROUGH THE FIRST BABYLONIAN SEIGE OF THE CITY AND RECOGNIZED THAT THE BABYLONIANS 
    WOULD SURELY RETURN at the outbreak of a new rebellion AND LEAVE LITTLE BUT 
    RUINS AND CORPSES IN THEIR WAKE.&quot;</font><b> </b>Heavenly Powers, Unraveling

<p><b><font size="+1"></font></b><font size="+1">My gentle critic said at the 
  time that it was confusing, not only because of the unfamiliar concepts but 
  because there was no immediate introduction to the point (or points) this work 
  was trying to make. One meets the ideas, she said, but does not know soon enough 
  what to make of them, or where to follow them. So we are compelled now, as we 
  were then, by the love of God-in-us for each other, and by our submission to 
  each other, to make this next attempt to say in the clearest way we are capable 
  of, what we believe the Most High is revealing again to all of us in our own 
  generation. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(And let us say at the outset: shame on all the preachers and 
  teachers of the Word of God, who, either refusing or unable to perceive the 
  historical connectedness [the structural relationship] of the sacred texts and 
  spiritual beliefs of all humankind, having also failed to realize how the whole 
  earth, and all of its peoples, is indeed filled with the manifestation of the 
  glory of God... </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord 
    sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with 
    (two) He covered His face, and with (two) He covered His feet, and with (two) 
    He did fly.</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And one cried unto the another, and said, Holy, holy, 
    holy: the whole earth is full of His Glory...</i>(Isaiah 6:1-3).</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1">Thus Paul wrote:</font><i><font size="+1"> Not holding the 
    Head (the Mind of God), from which all the body (the whole world) by joints 
    and bands, having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with 
    the increase of God...</font></i><font size="+1">(Colossians 2:19).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...still imagine that their religion or their group or their 
  limited point of view is the singularly correct one, for we are told that "every 
  mouth shall be stopped." It also says: <i>But who may abide the day of the Lord, 
  and who may stand when He appears?</i> [Malachi 3:2]. God has literally concluded 
  all of us in disbelief). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There is an ancient path that leads out of the Atlantean age, 
  and from the lower garden of Eden, across the sea to Europe, through Mesopotamia, 
  as far as India and down into Egypt (and from these places into all the world), 
  and we shall follow it. And we shall follow this path full circle back to the 
  garden again, back to the very root of the World Mystery itself, and to all 
  of the events that are presently unfolding in the world around us. But more: 
  This is a journey into the upper worlds of the Space-Time continuum--into the 
  hidden world of Four dimensions, and Ten. It is a journey into the supernal 
  realm that exists hand over hand, and side by side with our own, a world of 
  hidden Dragons and angelic forces--the realm of God. We ask the reader to take 
  this journey with us.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Yet we do not want to be presumptuous or arrogant in the Face 
  of Divine Reality, or to make such claims, as have so many others, that we have 
  torn the seals off God's Revelation. At the beginning of this work we said that 
  we would simply reach out and touch them, and give them a gentle tug. If they 
  came loose of their own accord we would be awed, and would praise God for it 
  all (which we do). (We know, of course, that to many we sound exactly like all 
  the others who have been, and who still are making popular claims to divine 
  revelation, ceaselessly traffiking in the Word of God as they do. We do not 
  want to be included among them, but I suppose in the eyes of some that we are. 
  Nevertheless, our work is for free, to all who may. The subjects here are the 
  inspiration of the Muses (the Holy Spirit), physics, psychology, history and 
  geography, not <i>religion</i> as we know it. It is about <i>awakening </i> 
  to a hidden reality, and about waging spiritual warfare in a time of Final Combat<i>. 
  The wise will understand</i>).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> We said that we would turn the key, as it were, to the Door 
  of the World Mystery. If the Door opened we would fall down before the wonder 
  of it all (and we have). We said that if it did not, then we would &quot;gladly&quot; 
  take our seat in the back of the congregation with all the rest; that the day 
  would declare it. If the Door opened, however, it would reveal to our mind's 
  eye the things that have been hidden in the garments of the created order, and 
  in the fabric of the historical process all these many centuries (all these 
  years and jubilees of years since the very time of Adam itself). And we pray 
  that those in our time who suddenly find themselves caught in a state of darkness 
  that they did not even realize existed, have the spiritual strength and courage 
  to stand up and get themselves out of it without partaking of the great transgression 
  as we are told that the children of Israel did in the days of Pharaoh (Exodus 
  5:20,21). As it is also written of our time here in America: <i>And at the end 
  of Four hundred years, I will judge that nation...</i>(Genesis 15:12-14):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"> <i>According to the days of thy coming out of the land of 
    Egypt will I shew unto them marvelous things...</i></font><font size="+1">(Micah 
    7:15; Revelation 15:3/Exodus 15.)</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Beware in a plague of leprosy...</i>(Deuteronomy 24:8,9; 
    Numbers 12.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This work, before anything else, is an effort to reemphasize 
  in the most urgent way the very first principle of the oracles of God: There 
  is only One God, one Divine Reality, one unfolding of natural and human events. 
  (Deuteronomy 32:39-42; Daniel 12:7; Revelation 10:5-7). The whole world, indeed 
  the entire universe, is filled with the meaning and the terrible awesomeness 
  of the glory of God. It is filled with the Revelation of God.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Perhaps the most striking thing we can say at the outset of 
  this work is that despite all that the world has been led to believe over the 
  events of the 20th century, the return to Zion has not happened yet, and that 
  the many passages of Scripture that were used to justify the establishment of 
  the State of Israel in 1948 are not fulfilled yet. They will be soon, but they 
  havn't been yet. Zion is still on its journey through the wilderness of the 
  Nations. It is still assembling itself here at the Western ends of the earth.</font></p>
