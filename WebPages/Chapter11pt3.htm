  <p>REST IN PEACE NEW DEAL. Awash in a bubble of laughter and economy-class California 
    champagne, Ronald Reagan led the toasts last week to the end of the half-century 
    liberal era in American government--and the triumph of his own 190-day counter 
    revolution. His radical package of tax cuts had just sailed through the Republican 
    Senate on an 89 to 11 breeze and cleared the Democratic House in a stunning 
    238 to 195 upset. His $35.2 billion assault on the Federal budget was safely 
    on track toward his desk by the weekend. His opposition lay broken before 
    him, so completely that he had to warn his own people against gloating and 
    cut some of the more braggartly lines out of the victory statement they had 
    drafted for him. It was enough, in his view, to proclaim &quot;THE BEGINNING 
    OF A NEW RENAISSANCE IN AMERICA&quot;--and to hope for his own sake, and the 
    nation's, that it works.</p>
  <p>That happy ending rests, as one of Reagan's own men said, on &quot;certain 
    leaps of faith&quot; in untested economic theory. The president's tax bill, 
    EVEN MORE THAN HIS AUSTERITY BUDGET, is the instrument of what Treasury Secretary 
    Donald T. Regan called &quot; a conservative revolution&quot; against 50 years 
    of welfare statesmanship...If it lives up to Reagan's bullish prospectus for 
    it, IT WILL SPUR SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT, REVIVIFY AMERICAN INDUSTRY, AND USHER 
    IN &quot;A NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY&quot; FOR EVERYONE. If it fails he will have 
    nobody but himself to blame...It displayed a mastery over congress that reminded 
    the media of Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 or Lyndon Johnson in 1965 AND SET 
    THE PRESIDENTS OWN MEN DREAMING, as one of them put it, OF &quot;REDESIGNING 
    AMERICA'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE&quot; WITH THE REAGAN COALITION FIRMLY IN CHARGE...</p>
  <p>Most of all, Reagan's future will be riding on the success or failure of 
    the experimentalist economic program to which he has now committed the nation 
    for years to come. Cornered by reporters at his victory celebration, HE PROPHESIED 
    &quot;SIGNS&quot; by the end of the year that it will have begun to work the 
    creative wonders he has promised...The mere fact of his come-from-behind victory 
    was a measure of how completely Reagan has dominated Washington thus far--and 
    how brilliantly he has marketed a program derided by his own Vice President 
    a year ago as &quot;Voo Doo Economics.&quot; <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newsweek,

<blockquote> 
  <p>The religion that Ronald Reagan promulgates, like that of many of his predecessors, 
    IS AN AMERICAN CIVIL RELIGION--an amalgam of Judeo-Christian heritage and 
    the national experience. It often casts national ambitions and aspirations 
    in religious metaphors, speaks of transcendent moral values, mixes piety with 
    patriotism, invokes God's name when speaking of the national destiny and generally 
    blurs the distinction between biblical faith and cultural religion.</p>
  <p>But as many scholars have pointed out, there are two kinds of civil religion: 
    the prophetic and the priestly. Both appeal to transcendent faith and moral 
    values but for very different purposes. Prophetic religion invokes the values, 
    ideals, and even the faith that stands above the behavior of the people and 
    practices of the nation. Martin Luther King Jr. stood firmly on that tradition 
    as he spoke to the nation about living up to the challenge of both biblical 
    faith and the best ideals and aspirations of America. Dorothy Day, by stubbornly 
    espousing and living out true gospel values, exposed the hypocrisy of a self-proclaimed 
    Christian nation that exploited the poor while finding its identity in possessions 
    and in the security of weapons.</p>
  <p>Even a president, Abraham Lincoln, called for national penitence for slavery 
    and civil war. He reminded a divided nation that both sides in the war read 
    the same Bible and prayed to the same God, which each believed to be on their 
    side. The prophetic stream of American Religion has been faithfully persistent 
    but never dominant. The more common form of American civil religion has been 
    its priestly variety. Here religion is used to comfort the people, to assure 
    them of their basic goodness and the soundness of their institutions, to assert 
    the righteousness of the national purpose and destiny. The appeal here is 
    to pride, and to the glory of the nation's past, present AND FUTURE.</p>
  <p>This is the religion of the prayer breakfasts, where presidents and other 
    political leaders gather with the nations religious leaders, not to bring 
    the nation under accountability to the Word of God, but to engage in mutual 
    affirmation and outright political campaigning...</p>
  <p>NEW HIGH PRIEST. Ronald Reagan has become the new high priest of the American 
    civil religion. Others have gone before him, often in the White House, and 
    others will go after him. But Reagan has become, quite self-consciously, the 
    chief spokesman for the religion of America. The religious themes in his speeches 
    are constant and recurrent: America is a nation set apart, specially blessed 
    and favored by God over other nations. We, like ancient Israel, are in fact 
    a chosen nation, DESTINED TO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE DIVINE PLAN.</p>
  <p>That, of course, is an often repeated theme in the history of American civil 
    religion and the rhetoric of presidents, and Ronald reagan has revived it 
    with his determination to make America again the powerful force he thinks 
    it ought to be in the world. The theme of his 1984 State of the Union message 
    made his meaning clear: &quot;AMERICA IS BACK, STANDING TALL AGAIN.&quot; 
    As the president-priest is always ready to proclaim, &quot;America is still 
    the last best hope of mankind.&quot; </p>
  <p>Nothing in all of this is biblical <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(well, 
    actually the whole of it is quite biblical)</font>. In fact, this self-understanding 
    is quite dangerous for any nation to possess, as previous great powers have 
    discovered too late. Ronald reagan continually uses the language of spiritual 
    renewal and revival. He links such SPIRITUAL REBIRTH not only to the restoration 
    of American power in the world, but also to American wealth and prosperity. 
    HE REPEATS THE MESSAGE OF THE TELEVISION PREACHERS who say America's wealth 
    is a sign of America's righteousness and, by implication, the poor people 
    and nations of the world are spiritually suspect...</p>
  <p>The Reagan theology also equates spiritual revival with an unprecedented 
    American military buildup. The tremendous increase in military spending has 
    come at the expense of social programs for the poor, and is thus founded on 
    a basic injustice. More than ever before, the nation, under the leadership 
    of Ronald Reagan, has put its faith and trust in its weapons of war in direct 
    opposition to the biblical warning not to trust in horses and chariots. DESPITE 
    THE NUCLEAR DANGER, THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT TALK TO OUR ADVERSARIES BUT 
    TALKS INSTEAD OF FIGHTING AND WINNING &quot;LIMITED&quot; NUCLEAR WARS.</p>
  <p>Indeed, the Soviet Union, Ronald Reagan told the cheering evangelicals assembled 
    in Orlando, Florida, in 1983, is &quot;the focus of evil in the modern world.&quot; 
    Our enemy is an &quot;evil empire,&quot; but our nuclear weapons are for a 
    righteous purpose. In a world poised on the edge of total destruction no more 
    frightening theology than this could be conceived of...He says, in fact, that 
    America has never committed any aggression or fought a war for selfish reasons. 
    To that the many victims of American violence surely raise their voices with 
    those of the many victims of Soviet atrocities and cry out to God...</p>
  <p>Apparently...the fundamental theology of some of the president's best friends 
    seem to have rubbed off on him in some quite disconcerting ways. On at least 
    five occasions in the last four years Reagan has referred to his belief that 
    Armageddon (the final battle between the forces of good and evil at the end 
    of the world) may be fast approaching. Jerry Falwell and the other fundamentalist 
    preachers who apparently have the president's ear link the&quot;end times&quot; 
    with a final confrontation with godless communism, perhaps involving nuclear 
    weapons. Though Falwell and others are quick to point out that the true Christians 
    would all be safely &quot;raptured&quot; before a nuclear holocaust, their 
    predictions, taken seriously, could prove to be more than a little dangerous. 
    What are the possible consequences of having a commander-in-chief who is sympathetic 
    to a fundamentalist view that, by a perverse and twisted logic, sees nuclear 
    war as part of God's will for the way the world will end?</p>
  <p>William Martin (of Rice University) puts the question well in the June, 1982 
    edition of <i>Atlantic</i> magazine: &quot;If the president were to appoint 
    one or more premillennialists to key foreign policy posts (who at the confirmation 
    hearings would think to probe for beliefs about the Second Coming?), what 
    incentive would they have to work for a lasting peace in the Mideast, since 
    they would regard a Russian-led attack on Israel as a necessary precursor 
    of the Millennium..? And if the nuclear destruction of Russia is foreordained, 
    in some premillennium schemes, might not a fundamentalist politician or general 
    regard his finger on the button as an instrument of God's eternal purpose?&quot;</p>
  <p>And what are the potential consequences for the nation of a president who 
    takes his religious advice almost exclusively from fundamentalist Christians 
    instead from church and religious leaders from across the spectrum of American 
    religious life? <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sojourners</font>.</p>

  came to power with him) is the beast with <i>Two Horns </i>as it is also written: 
  <i>When the Second shall begin to rule. </i> (2 Esdras 12:15; Revelation 13:

  to higher ambitions), but to the power of the entire office itself from the 
  time of Woodrow Wilson onwards. As the seed falls from the parent tree to sprout 
  anew (see Isaiah 40:20-24), so Ronald Reagan rose up to reestablish that same 
  Image of Greatness in the hearts and minds of the American people, as well as 
  in the world, as did Woodrow Wilson before him--that Image--the preeminence 
  and the power of the Office of the President of the United States of America.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PHILADELPHIA, (AP)__Following is 
    a transcript (excerpts) of President Reagan's speech today to participants 
    in the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As we stand here today before 
    Independence Hall, we can imagine that day, September 17, 1787, when the delegates 
    rose from their chairs and arranged themselves according to the geography 
    of their states, beginning with New Hampshire and moving south to Georgia. 
    They had labored for four months through the terrible heat of that Philadelphia 
    summer, but they knew as they moved forward to sign their names to that new 
    document that in many ways their work had just begun. This new Constitution, 
    this new plan of government, faced a skeptical, even hostile reception in 
    much of the country.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To look back on that time, at the 
    difficulties faced--and surmounted--can only give us perspective on the present. 
    Each generation, every age I imagine, is prone to think itself beset by unusual 
    and particularly threatening difficulties, to look back on the past as a golden 
    age, when issues were not so complex and politics not so divisive, when problems 
    did not seem so intractable....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact the Constitution and our 
    government were born in crises. The years leading up to our constitutional 
    convention were some of the most difficult our nation ever endured. This young 
    nation, threatened on every side by hostile powers, was on the verge of economic 
    collapse. In some states inflation raged out of control, Debt was crushing. 
    In Massachusetts, ruinously high taxes provoked an uprising of poor farmers 
    led by a former Revolutionary War captain, Daniel Shays...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Articles of Confederation, 
    all could see, WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD THIS NEW NATION TOGETHER </font><b>(Deuteronomy 
    4)</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. But there was no general 
    agreement on how a stronger federal government should be constituted--or, 
    indeed, whether one should be constituted at all. There were strong secessionist 
    feelings in many parts of the country...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No it wasn't the absence of problems 
    that won the day in 1787. It wasn't the absence of division and difficulty. 
    IT WAS THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING HIGHER--THE VISION OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT 
    FOUNDED THOSE SELF-EVIDENT TRUTHS THAT STILL RESOUND IN INDEPENDENCE HALL. 
    It was that ideal, proclaimed so proudly in this hall...that enabled them 
    to rise above politics and self-interest, to transcend their differences and 
    together create this document, THIS CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD FOREVER ALTER, 
    NOT JUST THESE UNITED STATES , BUT THE WORLD.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IN A VERY REAL SENSE, IT WAS THEN--IN 
    1787--THAT THE REVOLUTION TRULY BEGAN. FOR IT WAS WITH THE WRITING OUR CONSTITUTION, 
    SETTING DOWN THE ARCHITECTURE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, THAT THE NOBLE SENTIMENTS 
    OF 1776 TOOK ON SUBSTANCE, THAT THE HOPES AND DREAMS OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS 
    COULD BECOME A LIVING, ENDURING REALITY...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BUT ONCE THOSE IDEALS TOOK ROOT...once 
    those notions became a nation,WELL THEN, as I said, THE REVOLUTION COULD REALLY 
    BEGIN, NOT JUST IN AMERICA, BUT AROUND THE WORLD, A REVOLUTION TO FREE MAN 
    FROM TYRANNY OF EVERY SORT, AND SECURE HIS FREEDOM THE ONLY WAY POSSIBLE IN 
    THE WORLD...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If our Constitution has endured...it 
    has nor been simply as a plan of government, no matter how ingenious or inspired 
    that may be. This document that we that we honor today has always been something 
    more to us, filled us with a deeper feeling...more of reverence. One scholar 
    described our Constitution AS A KIND OF COVENANT. IT IS A COVENANT WE HAVE 
    MADE NOT ONLY WITH OURSELVES, BUT WITH ALL OF MANKIND...IT IS A HUMAN COVENANT, 
    YES, AND BEYOND THAT, A COVENANT WITH THE SUPREME BEING to whom our founding 
    fathers did constantly appeal for assistance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IT IS AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO 
    THAT IN MAN THAT IS TRULY UNIVERSAL, THAT CORE OF BEING THAT EXISTS BEFORE 
    AND BEYOND DISTINCTIONS OF CLASS, RACE, OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. IT IS A DEDICATION 
    OF FAITH TO THE HUMANITY WE ALL SHARE, THAT PART OF EACH MAN AND WOMAN THAT 
    MOST CLOSELY TOUCHES ON THE DIVINE...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE GUIDING HAND OF PROVIDENCE 
    DID NOT CREATE THIS NEW NATION OF AMERICA FOR OURSELVES ALONE, BUT FOR A HIGHER 
    CAUSE--THE PRESERVATION AND EXTENSION OF THE SACRED FIRE OF HUMAN LIBERTY.

<p><font size="+1">The true revolution in human freedom, according to Reagan, 
  began not with Moses or the adepts of the Mystery of Christ, but with the American 
  patriots in 1776. In the end, however, every Tree shall be known by its fruits. 
  Reagan ascribed to the American nation those things that can only apply to God's

  things of heaven and earth, and which is, in truth, comprised of all races,

    confidence, will, and emotion...the use of imaginative faculties, particularly 
    the ability to visualize, in order to begin to understand how other beings 
    function in nature so we can use this knowledge to achieve necessary ends.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This magic did not involve the 
    supernatural. It involved an understanding of psychological and environmental 
    processes; it was a kind of Shamanism, a knowledge of how emotion and concentration

  the Darkness from the Light into the religious life with them. That is, they 
  brought the &quot;old natural man&quot; with them into the &quot;newness of 
  their lives in Christ&quot; instead of slaying him at the Door. Just as Cain

  <p>We have begun well. <b>But it's only a beginning</b>. We're not here to congratulate 
    ourselves on what we have done but to challenge ourselves to finish what has 
    not yet been done. <b>We're here to speak for millions in our inner cities 
    who long for real jobs, safe neighborhoods, and schools that truly teach</b>. 
    We're here to speak for the American farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker 
    in industries fighting to modernize and compete. And, yes, we're here to stand, 
    and proudly so, for all who struggle to break free from totalitarianism, <b>for 
    all who know in their hearts that freedom is the one true path to peace and 
    human happiness</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(John 8:25-36)</font>.</p>
  <p><b>Proverbs tell us, without a vision the people perish</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Isaiah 
    29:10-14)</font>. When asked what great principle holds our Union together, 
    Abraham Lincoln said, &quot;Something in [the] Declaration giving liberty, 
    not alone to the people of this country, <b>but hope to the world for all 
    future time.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>We honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to the 
    dreams their vision foresaw</b>. <b>My fellow citizens, this nation is poised 
    for greatness</b>. The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge--a 
    second American Revolution of hope and opportunity; <b>a revolution carrying 
    us to new heights </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Isaiah 13 
    and 14)</font><b> of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space; 
    a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America, enabling us to summon 
    greater strength than we've ever known; and a revolution that carries beyond 
    our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world of peace</b>. Let 
    us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom. There are no constraints 
    on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, <b>no barriers to our 
    progress except those we ourselves erect</b>. Already, pushing down tax rates 
    has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth.</p>
  <p><b>In Europe, they're calling it &quot;the American Miracle.&quot; Day by 
    day, we're shattering accepted notions of what is possible</b>. When I was 
    growing up, we failed to see how a new thing called radio would transform 
    our marketplace. Well, today, many have not yet seen how advances in technology 
    are transforming our lives...<b>We stand on the threshold of a great ability 
    to produce more, do more,be more</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Luke, 
    12:15-34; 16:9-15)</font>. Our economy is not getting older and weaker; it's 
    getting younger and stronger. <b>It doesn't need</b> rest and <b>supervision</b>; 
    it needs new challenge, greater freedom. <b>And that word &quot;freedom&quot; 
    is the key to the second American Revolution that we need to bring about</b>.</p>
  <p>Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for fairness 
    and growth. Last year I asked the Treasury Secretary to develop a plan to 
    simplify the tax code, <b>so all taxpayers would be treated more fairly and 
    personal tax rates could come further down</b>. We have cut tax rates by almost 
    25 percent, yet the tax system remains unfair and limits our potential for 
    growth. Exclusions and exemptions cause similar incomes to be taxed at different 
    levels. Low-income families face steep tax barriers that make hard lives even 
    harder. The Treasury Department has produced an excellent reform plan, whose 
    principles will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact...</p>
  <p>To encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare, we 
    will propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totally 
    exempt from Federal income tax. To restore fairness to families, we will propose 
    increasing significantly the personal exemption. And tonight, I am instructing 
    Treasury Secretary James Baker-- I have to get used to saying that--to begin 
    working with congressional authors and committees for bipartisan legislation 
    conforming to these principles. We will call upon the American people for 
    support and upon every man and woman in this Chamber. <b>Together, we can 
    pass, this year, a tax bill for fairness, simplicity, and growth, making this 
    economy the engine of our dreams and America the investment capital of the 
    world. So let us begin</b>.</p>
  <p><b>Tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous 
    pent-up power of our economy</b>. But a second American Revolution must carry 
    the promise of opportunity for all. <b>It is time to liberate the spirit of 
    enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country</b>. This government 
    will meet its responsibility to help those in need. But policies that increase 
    dependency, break up families, and destroy self-respect are not progressive; 
    they're reactionary. <b>Despite our strides in civil rights, blacks, Hispanics, 
    and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full 
    economic power</b>. We have repeatedly sought passage <b>of enterprise zones</b> 
    to help those in the abandoned corners of our land <b>find jobs</b>, learn 
    skills, and build better lives. This legislation is supported by a majority 
    of you. Mr. Speaker, I know we agree that there must be no forgotten Americans. 
    <b>Let us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation 
    of entrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year</b>. And, Tip, you 
    could make that a birthday present...</p>
  <p>Nor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity wage 
    proposal. We can help teenagers, who have the highest unemployment rate, <b>find 
    summer jobs, so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in their 
    futures</b>. We'll continue to support the Job Training Partnership Act, which 
    has a nearly two-thirds job placement rate. Credits in education and healthcare 
    vouchers will help working families shop for services that they need. Our 
    administration is already encouraging certain low-income public housing residents 
    to own and manage their own dwellings. It's time that all public housing residents 
    have that opportunity of ownership.</p>
  <p><b>The Federal Government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom</b>. 
    But States and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery,must 
    not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to growth. 
    Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading 
    opportunity; that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading freedom. 
    There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on 
    deficit reductions. Well, the best way to reduce deficits is through economic 
    growth. More businesses will be started, more investments made,more jobs created, 
    and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes. The best way to reduce government 
    spending is to reduce the need for spending by increasing prosperity. Each 
    added percentage point per year of real GNP growth will lead to cumulative 
    reduction in deficits of nearly $200 billion over 5 years...</p>
  <p><b>Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just 
    as we near our goal of a fully equipped, trained, and ready professional corps. 
    National security is government's first responsibility; so in past years defense 
    spending took about half the Federal budget. Today it takes less than a third. 
    We've already reduced our planned defense expenditures by nearly a hundred 
    billion dollars over the past 4 years and reduced projected spending again 
    this year. You know, we only have a military-industrial complex until a time 
    of danger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy. Spending for defense 
    is investing in things that are priceless--peace and freedom...</b></p>
  <p>Our farm program costs have quadrupled in recent years. <b>Yet I know from 
    visiting farmers, many in great financial distress, that we need an orderly 
    transition to a market-oriented farm economy</b>. We can help farmers best 
    not by expanding Federal payments but by making fundamental reforms, keeping 
    interest rates heading down, and knocking down foreign trade barriers to American 
    farm exports...</p>
  <p>Nearly 50 years of government living beyond its means has brought us to a 
    time of reckoning. <b>Ours is but a moment in history. But one moment of courage, 
    idealism, and bipartisan unity can change American history forever</b>. Sound 
    monetary policy is key to long-running economic strength and stability. We 
    will continue to cooperate with the Federal Reserve Board, seeking a steady 
    policy that ensures price stability without keeping <b>interest rates</b> 
    artificially high <b>or needlessly holding down growth</b>...Every dollar 
    the Federal Government does not take from us, every decision it does not make 
    for us will make our economy stronger, our lives more abundant, <b>our future 
    more free</b>.</p>
  <p><b>Our second American Revolution will push on to new possibilities not only 
    on Earth but in the next frontier of space</b>. Despite budget restraints,we 
    will seek record funding for research and development. We've seen the success 
    of the space shuttle. Now we're going to develop a permanently manned space 
    station and new opportunities for free enterprise, <b>because in the next 
    decade Americans and our friends around the world will be living and working 
    together in space</b>. In the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture 
    in 30 days lifesaving medicines it would take 30 years to make on Earth. We 
    can make crystals of exceptional purity to produce super computers, creating 
    jobs, technologies, <b>and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed 
    possible</b>.</p>
  <p><b>As we do all this, we'll continue to protect our natural resources</b>. 
    We will seek reauthorization and expanded funding for the Superfund program 
    <b>to continue cleaning up hazardous waste sites which threaten human health 
    and the environment</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Revelation 
    11:18)</font></p>
  <p><b>Now, there's another great heritage to speak of this evening. Of all the 
    changes that have swept America the past 4 years, none brings greater promise 
    than our rediscovery of the values of faith, freedom, family, work, and neighborhood.</b></p>
  <p><b>We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship ; 
    renewed optimism and faith in our future; love of country rediscovered by 
    our young, who are leading the way. We've rediscovered that work is good in 
    and of itself, that it ennobles us to create and contribute no matter how 
    seemingly humble our jobs. We've seen a powerful new current from an old and 
    honorable tradition--American generosity. </b>From thousands answering Peace 
    Corps appeals to help boost food production in Africa, to millions volunteering 
    time, <b>corporations adopting schools</b>, and communities pulling together 
    to help the neediest among us at home,we have refound our values. Private 
    sector initiatives are crucial to our future.</p>
  <p>I thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation <b>giving religious 
    groups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups enjoy. 
    But no citizen need tremble, nor the world shudder, if a child stands in a 
    classroom and breathes a prayer. We ask you again, give children back a right 
    they had for a century and a half or more in this country</b>.</p>
  <p><b>The question of abortion grips our nation. Abortion is either the taking 
    of a human life or it isn't</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(IT 
    IS)</font>. And if it is--and medical technology is increasingly showing it 
    is--it must be stopped. It is a terrible irony that while some turn to abortion, 
    so many others who cannot become parents cry out for children to adopt. We 
    have room for these children. We can fill the cradles of those who want a 
    child to love. <b>And tonight I ask you in the Congress to move this year 
    on legislation to protect the unborn</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Revelation

  <p><b>In the area of education</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Deuteronomy 
    6:1-15; Psalm 106:34-42)</font>, we're returning to excellence, and again, 
    the heroes are our people, not government. We're stressing basics of discipline, 
    rigorous testing, and homework, while helping children become computer-smart 
    as well. For 20 years Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of our high school students 
    went down, but now they have gone up 2 of the last 3 years. We must go forward 
    in our commitment to the new basics, giving parents greater authority and 
    making sure good teachers are rewarded for hard work and achievement through 
    merit pay. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(See Education and the

  <p><b>Of all the changes in the past 20 years, none has more threatened our 
    sense of national well-being than the explosion of violent crime</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Leviticus 
    26; Deuteronomy 27; Deut.32)</font>. One does not have to be attacked to be 
    a victim. The woman who must run to her car after shopping at night is a victim. 
    The couple draping their door with locks and chains are victims; as is the 
    tired, decent cleaning woman who can't ride a subway home without being afraid.</p>
  <p>We do not seek to violate the rights of defendants. But shouldn't we feel 
    more compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime? 
    For the first time in 20 years, the crime index has fallen 2 years in a row. 
    <b>We've convicted over 7,400 drug offenders and put them, as well as leaders 
    of organized crime, behind bars in record numbers</b>.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Romans

  <p>But we must do more. I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact proposals 
    permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers acquire in good 
    faith. <b>These proposals would also reform the habeas corpus laws and allow, 
    in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of Americans, the use 
    of the death penalty where necessary</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1

    domestic tranquility. <b>And we mean to do just that</b>. </p>
  <p><b>Just as we're positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy,we're 
    poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more peaceful world. Our 
    alliances are stronger than ever. Our economy is stronger than ever. We have 
    resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world. And all of these

  <p>Since 1981 we've been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms agreements 
    that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear arsenals. 
    <b>Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced the Soviet 
    Union to return to the bargaining table</b>. Our negotiators must be able 
    to go to that table with the united support of the American people. <b>All 
    of us have no greater dream than to see the day when nuclear weapons are banned 
    from this Earth forever</b>.</p>
  <p>Each Member of the Congress has a role to play <b>in modernizing our defenses</b>, 
    thus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement. Your vote this 
    spring <b>on the Peacekeeper missile</b> will be a critical test of our resolve 
    to maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms 
    reductions. For the past 20 years we've believed that no war will be launched 
    as long as each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counter strike. 
    Well, I believe there's a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear 
    war.<b> It is a Strategic Defense Initiative</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Star 
    Wars...Does anyone understand this? John 1:51; 2 Thessalonians 1:4-10)</font> 
    aimed ultimately at finding a nonnuclear defense against ballistic missiles. 
    It's the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age. But it's not very well 
    understood.<b> Some say it will bring war to the heavens</b>, <b>but its purpose 
    is to deter war in the heavens and on Earth</b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Revelation 
    12:7-11)</font>. Now, some say the research would be expensive. Perhaps, but 
    it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity itself. And some say if we 
    build such a system, the Soviets will build a defense system of their own. 
    Well, they already have strategic defenses that surpass ours; a civil defense 
    system, where we have almost none; and a research program covering roughly 
    the same areas of technology that we're now exploring. And finally some say 
    the research will take a long time. Well, the answer to that is: &quot;Let's 
    get started.&quot;</p>
  <p>Harry Truman once said that, ultimately, our security and the world's hopes 
    for peace and human progress &quot;lie not in measures of defense or in the 
    control of weapons, <b>but in the growth and expansion of freedom and self-government</b>.&quot; 
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2 Peter 2:18-22; 3:5-12)</font>. 
    And tonight, we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world: <b>Freedom 
    is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal right of 
    all God's children. Look to where peace and prosperity flourish today. It 
    is in homes that freedom built. Victories against poverty are greatest and 
    peace most secure where people live by laws that ensure free press, free speech, 
    and freedom to worship, vote, and create wealth</b>.</p>
  <p><b>Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and to communicate 
    these ideals everywhere we can. America's economic success is freedom's success; 
    it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred different nations</b>. Many 
    countries in east Asia and the Pacific have few resources other than the enterprise 
    of their own people. But through low tax rates and free markets they've soared 
    ahead of centralized economies. <b>And now China is opening up its economy 
    to meet its needs. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Revelation 
    9:13-21; Daniel 11:2)</font><b>.</b></p>
  <p>We need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making and implementing 
    trade policy, and we'll be studying potential changes in that process in the 
    next few weeks. We've seen the benefits of free trade and lived through the 
    disasters of protectionism. <b>Tonight I ask all our trading partners, developed 
    and developing alike, to join us in a new round of trade negotiations to expand 
    trade and competition and strengthen the global economy--and to begin it in 
    this next year</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Revelation 
    18:7-20)</font>.</p>
  <p>There are more than 3 billion human beings living in Third World countries 
    <b>with an average per capita income of $650 a year</b>. Many are victims 
    of dictatorships that impoverished them with taxation and corruption. <b>Let 
    us ask our allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance

  <p>We cannot play innocents abroad in a world that's not innocent; nor can we 
    be passive when freedom is under siege. Without resources, diplomacy cannot 
    succeed. <b>Our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend 
    themselves and give them confidence to work for peace</b>. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The 
    School of the Americas)</font>. And I hope that you in the Congress will understand 
    that, dollar for dollar, security assistance contributes as much to global 
    security as our own defense budget. We must stand by all our democratic allies. 
    And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives--on every 
    continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua--to defy <b>Soviet-supported aggression</b> 
    and secure rights which have been ours from birth.</p>
  <p>The Sandinista dictatorship of Nicaragua, with full Cuban-Soviet bloc support, 
    not only persecutes its people, the church, and denies a free press, <b>but 
    arms and provides bases for Communist terrorists</b> attacking neighboring 
    states. <b>Support for freedom fighters is self-defense and totally consistent 
    with the OAS and U.N. Charters</b>. It is essential that the Congress continue 
    all facets of our assistance to Central America. I want to work with you to 
    support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied to our own security.</p>
  <p><b>And tonight, I've spoken of great plans and great dreams. They're dreams 
    we can make come true. Two hundred years of American history should have taught 
    us that nothing is impossible.</b></p>
  <p>Ten years ago a young girl left Vietnam with her family, part of the exodus 
    that followed the fall of Saigon. They came to the United States with no possessions 
    and not knowing a word of English. Ten years ago--the young girl studied hard, 
    learned English, and finished high school in the top of her class. And this 
    May, May 22d to be exact, is a big date on her calendar. Just 10 years from 
    the time she left Vietnam, <b>she will graduate from the United States Military 
    Academy at West Point</b>. I thought you might like to meet an American hero 
    named Jean Nguyen.</p>
  <p>Now, there's someone else here tonight, born 79 years ago. She lives in the 
    inner city, where she cares for infants born of mothers who are heroin addicts. 
    The children, born in withdrawal, are sometimes even dropped on her doorstep. 
    She helps them with love. Go to her house some night, and maybe you'll see 
    her silhouette against the window as she walks the floor talking softly, soothing 
    a child in her arms--Mother Hale of Harlem, and she, too, is an American hero. 
    Jean, Mother Hale, your lives tell us that the oldest American saying is new

<blockquote> 
  <p>WASHINGTON (UPI)__President Reagan, vowing to &quot;change history forever&quot; 
    in an activist second term, told several thousand administration officials 
    &quot;from here on it's shake, rattle and roll&quot; toward economic growth 
    and freedom everywhere. Reagan spoke at the fourth annual &quot;&quot;Executive 
    Forum,&quot; a gathering of political appointees, marking the start of his 
    second term and an apparent campaign to translate his electoral landslide 
    into tangible political support. &quot;WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE IS PROLOGUE,&quot; 
    he said. &quot;OUR GREATEST BATTLES LIE AHEAD--ALL IS NEWNESS NOW and the 
    possibility of great and fundamental change. We can change America forever.</p>
  <p>That's some great and beautiful music we have been playing the last four 
    years--but the way I see it, from here on it's &quot;shake, rattle and roll.&quot;...one 
    of the first rock and roll hits of an era when young people who formed the 
    core of his support were born. The program ended with the Marine Corps drum 
    and bugle corps playing &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; as a huge American 
    flag unfurled into the spotlight from the ceiling of DAR Constitutional Hall...</p>
  <p>&quot;It's been a tremendous four years, and I am feeling absolutely bullish 
    on the next four,&quot; Reagan crowed. &quot;I was thinking...that in our 
    first administration we made history--and in the second WE CAN CHANGE HISTORY 
    FOREVER.&quot;...He said that his philosophy can be summed up in one world--&quot;Freedom.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You know the results of our effort,&quot; he said. &quot;An economy 
    come alive again--A NATION COME ALIVE AGAIN.&quot;...WE HAVE TAKEN CONTROL 
    OF THE SHIP OF STATE AND CHANGED DIRECTION....It's all ahead full, there is 
    no turning back.&quot; He told his lieutenants to &quot;put up your feet and 
    relax, and don't think too much about the job&quot; this weekend. &quot;And 
    Monday when you come in, sit down at that desk and breath deep. BECAUSE MONDAY 
    THE WORLD STARTS OVER AGAIN--it's the beginning of a brand new administration--AND 
    WE'RE GOING TO MAKE NEW HISTORY TOGETHER FROM HERE ON IN.&quot;</p>

<p><font size="+1">An Image is a copy of something but not the thing itself. Thus 
  Reagan's truth is an image of the truth, it sounds like it, but it is not the 
  truth; and the American Presidency, likewise, is an image of the office of Messiah--but 
  it is not Messiah. It is an Image of it, an Anti-image</font></p>

    <p align="center">Indictments against the church by Marxists tempt one to 
      agree with Nietzsche--&quot;the last Christian died on the cross.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The way the story goes, an American tourist in Moscow chides a Soviet 
    acquaintance about his country's lack of freedom. &quot;Why, in America,&quot; 
    he says, &quot;I can stand in front of the Capitol and shout, 'Send Ronald 
    Reagan back to Hollywood!' and nothing will happen to me.&quot; &quot;That's 
    nothing,&quot; responds the Russian, &quot;I can stand in front of the Kremlin 
    and shout, 'Send Ronald Reagan back to Hollywood,' and nothing will happen 
    to me either..&quot;</p>
  <p>Undoubtedly, variations of this story have featured every American president 
    since Woodrow Wilson. And, since Lenin himself, a succession of Soviet leaders 
    has contributed to the images of a totalitarian state that denies basic human 
    rights, including freedom of religion. I am reminded of the Soviet Christian 
    who told me, &quot;We have full religious freedom in our country!&quot;--and 
    then, after a cautious look around, whispered, &quot;But we want more.&quot; 
    Western Christians, in the main, would insist that repression rather than 
    freedom is the key-note of church-state relations in the Communist world. 
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Romans 8:38)</font>. </p>
  <p>But the Western world also has an image. Freedom of speech? Maybe, says the 
    Communist, but words cannot fill an empty stomach--though, as the saying has 
    it, words must at times be eaten. And when freedom of speech means pornography, 
    when the freedom to bear arms means hourly homicides, when freedom of religion 
    means sanctified disregard of justice--repression does have its attraction! 
    No one who has visited the Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism in 
    Leningrad will dismiss the Marxist image of the church out of hand. Communists 
    can make a persuasive case against the Christian Church. A case that tempts 
    one to agree with Nietzsche--THE LAST CHRISTIAN DID DIE ON THE CROSS.</p>
  <p>Recently, and on a limited scale, Communist dialecticians and Christian theologians 
    have sat together to explore and compare &quot;images&quot; to the distress 
    of the &quot;righteous&quot; on both sides. (One remembers that Christ himself 
    was attacked by the &quot;righteous&quot; for eating with tax collectors and 
    other sinners). But in this nuclear age it surely is better to talk together 
    than to die together, and it should not be the Christians who discount the 
    convicting power of the Spirit! Does not the Scripture witness that in all 
    ages THERE HAVE BEEN MIGHTY ONES AMONG THE HEATHEN?...</p>
  <p>The image of Christianity that emerges from Christian-Marxist dialogue is 
    not flattering. In some respects, it is not accurate. In others it is all 
    too accurate. The image is based primarily on six charges:</p>
  <p>(1) THE CHURCH IS ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF ESTABLISHED AUTHORITY. It defends 
    the status quo, no matter how un-christian the status-quo may be. Russian 
    Orthodoxy sustained the cause, corruption, and oppressions of the Czar. Roman 
    Catholicism supports repressive governments. Dictatorships of the Right are 
    supported by both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. Alliances with the 
    bourgeois are legion.</p>
  <p>(2) THE CHURCH PACIFIES THE POOR WITH LULLABIES OF FUTURE RECOMPENSE IN THE 
    GREAT BEYOND <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(James 5; 2 Thessalonians 
    1:4-10 not withstanding), </font>offers prayers for the dead and sentimental 
    hymns in place of compassion and care for the living; in brief, dispenses 
    those bromides of cheap escape from reality that ...Marx called 'opium for 
    the people,'</p>
  <p>(3) CHRISTIANITY IS REACTIONARY IN PRINCIPLE. It puts the concrete injustice 
    of earth beyond human reach BY CONFINING BATTLES BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG TO 
    A DISTANT HEAVEN. Injustice in the here-and-now is quietly countenanced because 
    punishment is relegated to God the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent 
    ONE <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(quite true)</font>. Even in 
    heaven,we are told, there is a hierarchy, and Celestial inequality gives license 
    to Terrestrial inequality. God is said to grant His benediction to, and confer 
    authority on, whatever government has usurped power at a given moment. It 
    is authorized to wield the sword of injustice, whereas the poor are refused 
    every right to defend themselves. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The 
    Lamb of God, defend himself? There is a lack of spiritual understanding here 
    as well...2 Corinthians 10:3-6; Ephesians 6:10-19; James 5).</font></p>
  <p>(4) THE CHURCH IS REACTIONARY BECAUSE IT TURNS A PERSON FROM HIS REAL FUTURE, 
    CIRCUMSCRIBING HIM WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF AN ALLEGED SINFUL NATURE. The symbol 
    under which this resignation is preached is eloquent: it is THE CROSS. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1 
    Corinthians 1:18-28)</font>...</p>
  <p>(5) THE CHURCH IS REACTIONARY BECAUSE IT PROCLAIMS THE GOSPEL OF CHARITY. 
    But charity is the invention of the strong <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1 
    Corinthians 13...KJV)</font>, who pose as just and gracious men, while in 
    reality remaining unjust and without pity. The employer who has enriched himself 
    by the sweat of his employees permits himself (through his <i>generosity) 
    </i>the...approval of priests and prelates. In reality he is returning an 
    infinitesimal portion of what he has stolen from the workers...Though professing 
    the ethic of <i>agape </i>love, the church has used physical, mental and spiritual 
    coercion to achieve its ends. The church has slaughtered both Christian and 
    heathen to bring them into the loving embrace of God. States became instruments 
    through which the church perpetuated injustice, AND THE CHURCH ITSELF BECAME 
    A DEN OF THIEVES.</p>
  <p>Dismiss what charges we can...we are left with a residue of truth. But Communists 
    should know that every accusation hits us hard, not to the degree that we 
    are consistent Christians, but to the degree that we are not. In fact, much 
    of the same charges are hurled against us in Holy Writ. The Bible does not 
    justify the Pharisee but calls him to account (Matthew 19:21-24; Matthew 23)....Are 
    such indictments from Christ's mouth less severe than those from the Marxist's? 
    The difference is not one of degree but of target: while Marxists direct their 
    charges against Christianity itself, Christ directs his against false disciples. 
    Hearing the Communist attack against Christianity, one feels like crying out 
    &quot;But this is not Christianity!&quot; This is the perversion, the counterfeit, 
    the prostituted. And what was Christ's judgment on THE ALLIANCE OF APOSTATE 
    CHURCH AND OPPRESSIVE STATE? HEAR THE WORDS RECORDED BY THE REVELATOR:</p>
  <p>&quot;'Come and I will show you the judgment of the Great Whore, enthroned 
    above the ocean. The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, 
    and on the wine of her fornication men all over the world have made themselves 
    drunk.' In the spirit he carried me away into the wilds, and there I saw a 
    woman (the corrupted church) mounted on a scarlet beast (the corrupted state) 
    which was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. 
    The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and bedizened with gold and jewels 
    and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup, full of obscenities and the foulness 
    of her fornication; AND WRITTEN ON HER FOREHEAD WAS A NAME WITH A SECRET MEANING: 
    'BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF WHORES, AND OF EVERY OBSCENITY ON EARTH.' 
    THE WOMAN I SAW, WAS DRUNK WITH THE BLOOD OF GOD'S PEOPLE AND WITH THE BLOOD 
    OF THOSE WHO HAD BORN THEIR TESTIMONY TO JESUS.</p>
  <p>And then the angel messenger said to me, 'The ocean you saw, where the Great 
    Whore sat, is an ocean of peoples and populations, axions and languages. As 
    for the Ten horns you saw, they together with the beast will come to hate 
    the whore; they will strip her naked and leave her desolate...The Woman that 
    you saw is the Great City that holds sway over the kings of the earth.'</p>
  <p>After this another angel messenger in a mighty voice, proclaimed 'FALLEN, 
    FALLEN, IS BABYLON THE GREAT! She has become a dwelling place for demons, 
    a haunt for every unclean spirit...For all nations have drunk deep of the 
    fierce wine of her fornication; the kings of the earth have committed fornication 
    with her, and merchants the world over have grown rich on her bloated wealth.'</p>
  <p>Then I heard another voice from heaven that said, COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE, 
    LEST YOU TAKE PART IN HER SINS, AND SHARE IN HER PLAGUES. FOR HER SINS ARE 
    PILED HIGH AS HEAVEN, AND GOD HAS NOT FORGOTTEN HER CRIMES (Rev.17:1-6, 15-18; 
    18:1-5 N.E.B.).</p>
  <p>Harsh as is the Communist indictment of Christianity, it does not equal this 
    divine indictment of the fallen church. Students of church history--and in 
    the Soviet context, Orthodox church history--cannot escape the conviction 
    that the Marxist-oppressed church is reaping what it has sown. THE CHURCH 
    HAS PROFESSED CHRIST WHILE DEFENDING ANTICHRISTIAN DOCTRINES AND PRACTICES. 
    Thus it bears responsibility for the appeal of Communism and even for its 
    emergence. Were churches more penitent they would manifest great self-scrutiny 
    and self-criticism. At the very least the result would be less belligerence 
    and self-righteousness.</p>
  <p>These observations are not intended to obscure the real hardships Christianity 
    has suffered, and suffers still, UNDER COMMUNIST REGIMES <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(So 
    then which political and economic system is the system of Antichrist? To which 
    system is the believer in danger of losing their soul...2 Corinthians 11...KJV)?</font> 
    To the Marxist, religion is either a tool to be used or an enemy to be destroyed--though 
    some of the more liberal are willing to give the church license to destroy 
    itself. Constitutional guarantees of the right to believe, embodied in most 
    Marxist constitutions, do not entail the right to witness; only Communists 
    may propagate their belief. COMMUNISM IS NOT NOTED FOR OFFERING A FREE MARKET, 
    WHETHER IN ECONOMICS, POLITICS, OR RELIGION. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Please 
    consider the chapter entitled &quot;Fascism&quot; Fascism in America that 
    is)</font>...</p>
  <p>Sadly Marxists have not learned the pitfalls of imposed conformity from their 
    deposed predecessors of church and of state. How different things might have 
    been had they truly separated church and state, rather than making the church 
    a creature of the State! PERHAPS THE CHURCH, IN THE MAIN, HAS LEARNED THE 
    MERITS OF ALLOWING EVERY MAN TO GO TO HELL IN HIS OWN WAY: THIS WISDOM THE 
    MARXISTS HAVE NOT YET DEMONSTRATED.</p>
  <p>It may be a long time before a Russian can stand in front of the Kremlin 
    and shout &quot;Send Comrade Andropov back to the collective farm!&quot; It 
    may be along time before a Russian Christian can pass out tracts even in a 
    back alley. Freedoms do not come easily to the Marxist state. But we will 
    remember, neither did they come easily to the Christian Church. The Communist 
    charges against the church have merit. WE WHO FEEL ASHAMED MUST GO FORTH, 
    WITH GREATER HUMILITY, TO WITNESS AND SUFFER FOR THE TRUTH.&quot;</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;Nancy and I are so honored to be your guests tonight--to share a little 
    of your special time...Many's the time I've said a prayer of thanks to all 
    Americans who placed this trust in my hands, and tonight, please accept again

    Eight years ago we gathered in Detroit in a troubled time for our beloved

    wondered if we dared be so bold TO TAKE ON THOSE BURDENS.</p>
  <p>THAT YEAR, IT WAS OUR DREAM THAT TOGETHER WE WOULD RESCUE AMERICA AND MAKE 
    A NEW BEGINNING--TO CREATE ANEW THAT SHINING CITY ON A HILL. The dream we 
    shared was to reclaim our government--to transform it from one that was consuming 
    our prosperity into one that would get out of the way of those who created 
    prosperity. It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to preserve 
    world peace and freedom AND TO RECAPTURE OUR NATIONAL DESTINY.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>Watching the pageant in New York Harbor last week I FELT A LITTLE THE WAY 
    I DID WALKING THROUGH A HAPSBURG MUSEUM IN VIENNA as a student-tourist many 
    years ago. There was A HISTORICAL PROGRESSION in the royal artifacts and vestments 
    on display that finally reached such a pitch of richness, extravagance--too 
    muchness--THAT YOU KNEW THE THING WOULD SOON BE OVER. No more jewel-encrusted, 
    floor-length robes as the century changed; enter the age of the business suit.</p>
  <p>I don't mean to suggest that we are about to swing from an orgy of unabashed 
    patriotism to an orgy of self-criticism or doubt or anything like that, ONLY 
    THAT THERE IS SOMETHING CYCLICAL AT WORK HERE AND IT LOOKS TO ME TO BE REACHING 
    A POINT OF CULMINATION.</p>
  <p>In a sense you could say the festivities in New York were America's revenge 
    on the 60s, and so is Ronald Reagan, the most fitting president we could have 
    had for the Age of Ceremony. Even as my colleagues and I in the pundit racket 
    KEEP SEARCHING FOR THE SECRET OF REAGAN'S POLITICAL STRENGTH and endlessly 
    pitting his high personal rating against his not-so-high ratings on the issues, 
    we glide by this crucial fact. REAGAN HAS RIGHTLY SENSED THE NATIONAL CRAVING 
    FOR REAFFIRMATION AND SPLENDOR after a diet decade or so of skepticism and 
    guilt...</p>
  <p>Jimmy Carter's famous inaugural walk down Pennsylvania Avenue in fact was 
    meant to signal an end to the Hapsburg-like characteristics into which the 
    American presidency was though to have sunk. Reagan, from literally his first 
    day in office put an end to the spartan self-flagellation and restraint, and 
    ushered in an ever-expanding calendar of upbeat ceremonial events.</p>
  <p>LUXURY UNASHAMED. Start with the Reagan Inaugural gatherings, a kind of Restoration 
    after the era of Reformation--Royalists versus Roundheads, luxury unashamed, 
    finery unembarrassed. Remember the moving early pageantry and parade when 
    the hostages came home. Consider the manner in which this president has transformed 
    the annual State of the Union address from one kind of ritual to another...Think 
    of the Olympics. Think of the Normandy commemoration. And recall unhappy Bitburg 
    or the memorial rites for the Marines of Beirut, for the homebound soldiers 
    who crashed in Newfoundland, for the Challenger crew; even when you are angry 
    about the occasion or crushed by it, the public rites impress, perhaps awe; 
    they hush the crowd and still the controversy. Reagan knows this. HE IS A 
    GENIUS AT MOBILIZING PUBLIC SENTIMENTS AND ACTING OUT NATIONAL RITUALS,LEGENDS 
    AND FANTASIES, the values that we insist motivate us as a people, whether 
    they do or not... </p>
  <p>END OF AN ERA. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Not yet).</font> 
    The thorough-goingness of the public acceptance of the Age of Ceremony, WITH 
    ALL ITS UPBEAT IMPLICATIONS, AND THE HINT THAT IT MIGHT BE OVER SOON, were 
    embodied in the same evidence for me: the sight and sound of so many ordinarily 
    detached and skeptical newsmen on TV waxing absolutely lyrical over our country, 
    our flag, our statue, our Navy, AND YES, GOD SAVE US,OUR PRESIDENT...Surely 
    if not the end of the world, at least the end of an era is nigh. I mean, if 
    journalism is aboard the thing has gone too far, it will collapse of its own 
    weight. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newsweek, July 14, 1986</font>.</p>

<p><i><font size="+1">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister 
  for them who shall be heirs of salvation? </font></i><font size="+1">(Hebrews 
  1:14). How did Mikhail Gorbachev minister to the heirs of God's kingdom? By 
  presiding over those momentous events that have led to the revelation of the 
  spirit of Antichrist in the world, and rise of the kingdom of the Beast--America, 
  the only remaining Superpower in the earth. (See Revelation 13:4). He allowed 
  the Iron Curtain to swing open, releasing forces that had been pent up since 
  the Second World War. The Iron Curtain was a historic metaphor running through 
  the Center of Europe and the place named Beauty on the World Tree, dividing 
  that which was above (or beyond) our comprehension from that which was below, 
  or within our comprehension. How did Paul say it: <i>Let no man beguile you 
  of your reward in a voluntary humility (submission) and worshipping of angels, 
  intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his 
  fleshly mind. </i>(Colossians 2:18). Thus the words: <i>Ye shall see the heavens 
  opened and the angels of God ascending </i>(from the West)<i> and descending 
  </i>(from the East)<i> upon the Son of man. </i>(John 1:51).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As God brings about the conditions in the world that make for 
  both understanding and redemption, so each individual child of God must descend 
  into the empire of their own soul to wage the battle against the only individual 
  on earth they are permitted to rule over with force--themself. As God makes 
  war in the world, and draws the fallen spirit in man up to meet Him in battle, 
  the spiritual soul must make war against every thought and natural impulse that 
  keeps it from coming to perfection in Christ. And despite the proclamations 
  of some American evangelists that, while they desire peace, they are not pacifists--a 
  severe spiritual contradiction--only a complete pacifist will be able to fight 
  their way out of the things that God is bringing to pass upon the earth.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> In this cosmic battle between Light and Darkness one joins 
  the ranks of all true Spiritual Warriors in the earth. And in the overcoming, 
  as the spiritual order in one's own soul is restored, and the world inside of 
  one's mind transformed, one discovers that their own thoughts have been the 
  object, and have become the final synthesis in the dialectical struggle between 
  the two world orders--the Material Order of World Communism above, and the Material 
  Order of Western Capitalism below. Old images are destroyed, and new awarenesses 
  take their place. Christ-Consciousness is born.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The transformed mind also senses something of the sublime order 
  hidden in what seems to be a world presently out of order, as it is written: 
  <i>To make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the 
  beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Christ 
  YHShWH.</i> (One should be able to read the Oracle by now):</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Voice of God translates from heaven, across the forces 
  and dimensions that shape the whole of physical reality, the whole of human 
  consciousness, and by extension the whole of human conversation. The Mind of 
  Christ-in-us traces all human speech, as well as all human activities, back 
  to their source in the Invisible Realm. Make the connection between the text 
  at Daniel 6:12-28 concerning Babylon's adversary, the Medes (and the word to 
  consider at Daniel 6:26 is <i>steadfast</i>), and the words in Hebrews:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore we ought to give more earnest heed to the things 
    we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</font></i></p>

    them that heard him...</font></i><font size="+1">(Hebrews 2:1-3). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">(And then, knowing something now of the spiritual world view, 
  and the literary methods of the Essenes--how they understood and lived out the 
  Mystery of Christ in their times in light of those things that are actually 
  coming to pass in our times--we might be able to discern the words at Matthew 
  28:1-4 in this same light. The dramatic and prophetic import of these words 
  is not fulfilled yet).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The rabbis taught us to interpret the words: <i>And ye shall 
  be as gods, </i>(Gen.3:5), to mean: <i>Ye shall be as creators of worlds</i>. 
  Since the time of Woodrow Wilson the leaders of the American nation have been 
  trying to create a world in their own image, an attempt which peaked with Ronald 
  Reagan. &quot;It is time for a second American Revolution&quot; he said. &quot;Tonight 
  I have spoken of great plans and great dreams. They are dreams we can make come 
  true...Two hundred years of American history have taught us that nothing is 
  impossible. History is asking us once again, to be a force for good in the world.&quot; 
  As this Torch was passed, George Bush, also hearkening back to the first Presidential 
  inauguration 200 years before, did not only take the oath of office on Washington's 
  Bible, but he accepted his nomination to this office framed in the American 
  colors while paraphrasing a prophecy attributed to Washington himself: &quot;A 
  Thousand Points of Light:&quot;</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Instantly a Light of a Thousand 
    Suns shown down from above me, and pierced and broke into fragments the dark 
    clouds which enveloped America. At the same time the angel upon whose head 
    still shone the word Union, and who bore our National Flag in one hand and 
    a sword in the other, descended from the heavens attended by legions of white 
    spirits. These immediately joined the inhabitants of America, who I perceived 
    were well nigh overcome, but who immediately taking courage again, closed 
    up their broken ranks and renewed the battle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then once more I beheld the villages, 
    towns and cities springing up where I had seen them before, while the bright 
    angel, planting an azure standard he had brought in the midst of them, cried 
    with a loud voice: 'While the stars remain, and the heavens send down dew 
    upon the earth, so long shall the Union last.' And taking from his brow the 
    crown on which blazoned the word Union, he placed it upon the Standard while 
    the people, kneeling down, said, Amen.&quot; </font>George Washington's Vision

<p><font size="+1">It is obvious that neither Washington or Bush had read the 
  32nd chapter of Deuteronomy. George Bush went on to proclaim himself by saying:

    is worshipped, so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself 
    that he is God...</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For this cause God sent upon them a strong delusion, that 
    they might believe a lie.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">That they might be condemned who believed not the truth, 
    but had pleasure in unrighteousness...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 Thessalonians

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;No one can doubt here that 
    Paul is speaking of the Antichrist, telling us that the day of the Lord will 
    not come without the prior coming of a figure whom he called the Apostate, 
    meaning of course, an apostate from the Lord God. And if this appellation 
    can rightly be attached to the ungodly, how much more to him. There is, however, 
    some uncertainty about the 'temple' in which he is to take his seat. Is it 
    the ruins of the temple built by king Solomon, or actually in a church? For 
    the Apostle would not say 'the temple of God' if he meant the temple of some 
    idol or demon. For that reason some people have it that Antichrist means here 
    not the leader himself but what we might call his whole body, the multitude, 
    that is, of those who belong to him, together with himself, their leader. 
    And they suppose that then it would be more correct to say, following the 
    original Greek, that he 'takes his seat as the temple of God...' (1 Cor.3:16-19) 
    instead of 'in the temple of God,' purporting himself to be God's temple, 
    that is, the Church, in the same way as we say, 'He sits as a friend' meaning 
    'like a friend.'&quot; </font>Augustine's City of God, Book XX<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">By Franz Schurman</font></p>
<p align="center">FEBRUARY, 2002</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;</b>The United States, now the world's solo superpower, is fast 
    becoming a world empire...An empire is a political entity that rules over 
    diverse peoples and territories. Its power is based on an awesome ability 
    to rule over others, and it is led by an emperor. Both &quot;empire&quot; 
    and &quot;emperor&quot; come from the same Latin root, <i>imperare, </i>meaning 
    &quot;to command.&quot;</p>
  <p>Just as the British Empire--the most recent empire on the world stage--ruled 
    the seas and world trade, so now does the United States. Its military forces 
    are now almost everywhere in the world. Despite the recession, it remains 
    the heart and core of the world economy.</p>
  <p>America created and dominates the World Trade Organization. It created and 
    dominates NATO. The military forces of its allies, such as Turkey, Egypt, 
    Japan and many others, are armed with American weapons and organized along 
    American lines.</p>
  <p>Historically, an imperial state produces an aura of a religious or law-giving 
    character...America's aura is not so much about law as values. American values 
    in almost every sphere of individual and social life have spread throughout 
    the world. </p>
  <p>The citizens of an empire are not always comfortable with their role...In 
    the last presidential campaigns, both the progressive Ralph Nader and the 
    nationalist Pat Buchanan opposed globalism. George W. Bush and Al Gore supported 
    it. Immediately after Sept. 11, President Bush, a moderate conservative, fingered 
    the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan as rebels against the world. Three month 
    later, the Taliban was crushed...When Bush delivered his State of the Union 
    address, interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai sat next to Laura Bush...Has 
    Bush now become commander in chief in Afghanistan? The answer is yes...</p>
  <p>Other nations have recognized the new empire-in-the-making. The Egyptian 
    newspaper Al-Ahram last month quoted a Chinese general, Fu Quangyou: &quot;America 
    is using the war on terror to gain world hegemony.&quot;</p>
  <p>Though China is relatively silent on the subject, it has made clear its worry 
    about America's military penetration of Central Asia, specifically building 
    air bases in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and stationing troops in Tajikistan. 
    All three border on China.</p>
  <p>High Russian officials have voiced strong criticism of America's entry into 
    a region that used to be part of the defunct Soviet Union. And they are even 
    more critical of America's persistent pushing of &quot;NATO expansion.&quot;</p>
  <p>The American Empire has become a reality that can't be pulled back. And leaders 
    of the world may be turning into so many satraps.<b> </b><font size="2">San
