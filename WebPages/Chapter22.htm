<p><font size="+1">As the Gospels are a suprahistorical and futuristic insight 
  into the structure of higher reality--a blend of (true) myth and history composed 
  in that peculiar epic tense characteristic of the Hebrew mind--so the Book of 
  Revelation follows in the same pattern. It is, however, not only a vision of 
  future historical events (events that have been unfolding in the world since 
  the beginning of the great judgment wars of the 20th century, and which are 
  still unfolding), it is a composite, or a paraphrase, of all the books of the 
  prophets that came before it. It reaches into the past and translates all that 
  was written in those ancient times directly overhead and into the future. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You will recall from the 11th chapter that there was a prophetic 
  code hidden in the Mystery of the Hebrew Kings...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/HebrewKings2.gif" width="478" height="706"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">...and that the keys to that code was discovered 
  in the 9th chapter of Daniel and the 25th chapter of Jeremiah:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">IN THE FIRST YEAR OF DARIUS the son of A-has-u-e'RUS, 
    of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans 
    </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(over Babylon)</font><i><font size="+1">;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">IN THE FIRST YEAR OF HIS REIGN I Daniel understood by 
    books the number of the years, WHEREOF THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAH 
    THE PROPHET that He would accomplish Seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 
    9:1,2).</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of 
    Judah IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF JEHOIAKIM the son of Josiah king of Judah, THAT 
    WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF NEBUCHADREZZAR KING OF BABYLON...</font></i><font size="+1">(Jeremiah 
    25:1). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Look into the 25th chapter of Jeremiah, and see in those prophetic 
  accounts, not a record of things that happened in the ancient past but of things 
  that came to pass when Thomas Woodrow Wilson and the The United States of America 
  broke the bounds, violated the covenant of Life, and declared war on Central 
  Europe in the 20th century. This was also the year that the Soviet Union came 
  to power in the East, for the Medes were to ancient Babylon what the Soviets, 
  and now Russia, are to America (Revelation 6:1-4). Please read the 24th chapter 
  of Matthew, as well as Luke, chapter 21 in the light of those events.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And so likewise, we open the pages of the Book of Isaiah in 
  the days of <i>Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah </i>(Isaiah 
  1:1), which are also the times of the American and French Revolutions, and counting 
  the years further backwards we can begin to open the Books of David and Solomon 
  in the 16th century, at the time of the Reformation and the exploration and 
  return again to the Western Continent--to Eden.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the author(s), having the keys, looking into the pattern 
  of creation, sensing the ominous presence of the Dragon below their feet, and 
  the Presence of God everywhere around and above them, understanding the Law 
  of Correspondances (As above, so below; As in the East, so in the West; as in 
  the Past, so in the Future), consulted the oracles, poured over the sacred texts, 
  listened to the Spirit, and knowing that the texts were not referring to that 
  city of Jerusalem in the East, but the City Above, <i>The Mother of Us All</i>, 
  and that God would not only judge that City, as He did that city in the East 
  in their own time, but also raise up the kingdom of Babylon again in the last 
  days, projected all that they understood and believed Forty Jubilees (40 X 49 
  years) into the future. The things that they saw, in dreams and visions, are 
  the very things that are unfolding in the world as we write. It was a terrible 
  vision, even as Paul (in league with the secret teachings of the Essenes, and 
  quoting from the first chapter of <a href="SideLinks/HabakkukCommentary.htm">Habakkuk</a>), 
  wrote:</font></p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish: for I work 
    a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man 
    declare it unto you...</font></i><font size="+1">(Acts 13:40,41; Habakkuk,

  <p>Ursa Major (the Great bear) is direct and clear cut. It is neither inferred 
    nor constructed. It is simply there, taken in visually. One of its main stars

    the night and all times of the year...</p>

    of its stars by Indo Europeans as the Seven Rishis (the Seven wise ones, and), 
    as sources of cosmic harmony and PERENNIAL WISDOM...The possibility that Ursa 
    accounts for the whole northern Seven mystique already had arisen. ...We need 
    to ask (however) what status Ursa Major had in the Middle East and whether 
    it was conspicuous enough to promote the mystique derived from it. We also 
    need to ask whether the mystique took shape there independently or came as 
    an import...It appears that the Seven Rishis might have entered Mesopotamia 
    as the Seven Sages <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(and later as 
    the Bishops of the Seven Churches)</font>...</p>
  <p>Santillana and von Dechend hit on it in the passage quoted; where they say 
    that 'the cosmic ordering is mythically dictated by the Seven sages,' as they 
    are often cryptically mentioned in India and elsewhere. '...They are the Seven 
    Rishis or Seven Seers of the Indo-Aryans,' identified with the stars, whom 
    we have glimpsed apparently passing into Mesopotamia as the Seven Sages, the 
    Sebettu, founders of Seven cities...</p>

  After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first

  Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. </p>
<p>4:2 <br>
  And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven,

  were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits

  of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD

<p>4:9 <br>
  And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the

  worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the

  and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. </p>

  And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open 
  the book, and to loose the seals thereof? </p>
<p>5:3 <br>
  And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open 
  the book, neither to look thereon. </p>

  neither to look thereon. </p>
<p>5:5 <br>

  of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the 
  seven seals thereof. </p>
<p>5:6 <br>
  And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and 
  in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven 
  horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all 
  the earth. </p>
<p>5:7 <br>
  And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the 
  throne. </p>
<p>5:8 <br>
  And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell 
  down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full 
  of odours, which are the prayers of saints. </p>
<p>5:9 <br>
  And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open 
  the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood 
  out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; </p>
<p>5:10 <br>
  And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

  the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten 
  thousand, and thousands of thousands; </p>

  Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power,

  noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. </p>
<p>6:2 <br>
  And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a 
  crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. </p>
<p>6:3 <br>
  And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and 
  see. </p>
<p>6:4 <br>
  And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that 
  sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: 
  and there was given unto him a great sword. </p>
<p>6:5 <br>
  And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and 
  see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of 
  balances in his hand. </p>
<p>6:6 <br>
  And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat 
  for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not 
  the oil and the wine. </p>
<p>6:7 <br>
  And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast 
  say, Come and see. </p>
<p>6:8 <br>
  And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, 
  and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part 
  of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with 
  the beasts of the earth. </p>
<p>6:9 <br>
  And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them 
  that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 
</p>
<p>6:10 <br>
  And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost 
  thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? </p>
<p>6:11 <br>
  And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, 
  that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also 
  and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. 
</p>
<p>6:12 <br>
  And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; 
  and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; 
</p>
<p>6:13 <br>
  And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her

<p>6:14 <br>
  And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain

<p>6:15 <br>
  And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief

  Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nephthalim 
  were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand. 
</p>
<p>7:7 <br>
  Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were 
  sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand. 
</p>
<p>7:8 <br>
  Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph 
  were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. 
</p>
<p>7:9 <br>
  After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, 
  of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, 
  and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; </p>
<p>7:10 <br>
  And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon 
  the throne, and unto the Lamb. </p>
<p>7:11 <br>
  And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the 
  four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, 
</p>
<p>7:12 <br>
  Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, 
  and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. </p>
<p>7:13 <br>
  And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed 
  in white robes? and whence came they? </p>
<p>7:14 <br>
  And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which 
  came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white 
  in the blood of the Lamb. </p>
<p>7:15 <br>
  Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in 
  his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. </p>
<p>7:16 <br>
  They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light 
  on them, nor any heat. </p>
<p>7:17 <br>
  For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall 
  lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears 
  from their eyes. </p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>8:1 <br>
  And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the 
  space of half an hour. </p>
<p>8:2 <br>
  And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven 
  trumpets. </p>
<p>8:3 <br>
  And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there 
  was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of 
  all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. </p>
<p>8:4 <br>
  And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended 
  up before God out of the angel's hand. </p>
<p>8:5 <br>
  And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast 
  it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and 
  an earthquake. </p>
<p>8:6 <br>
  And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. 
</p>
<p>8:7 <br>
  The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, 
  and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, 
  and all green grass was burnt up. </p>
<p>8:8 <br>
  And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire 
  was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; </p>
<p>8:9 <br>
  And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; 
  and the third part of the ships were destroyed. </p>
<p>8:10 <br>
  And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning 
  as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the 
  fountains of waters; </p>
<p>8:11 <br>
  And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters 
  became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. 
</p>
<p>8:12 <br>
  And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and 
  the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third 
  part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and 
  the night likewise. </p>
<p>8:13 <br>
  And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying 
  with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of 
  the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>9:1 <br>
  And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: 
  and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. </p>
<p>9:2 <br>
  And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as 
  the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason 
  of the smoke of the pit. </p>
<p>9:3 <br>
  And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given 
  power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. </p>
<p>9:4 <br>
  And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, 
  neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not 
  the seal of God in their foreheads. </p>
<p>9:5 <br>
  And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should 
  be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, 
  when he striketh a man. </p>
<p>9:6 <br>
  And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire 
  to die, and death shall flee from them. </p>
<p>9:7 <br>
  And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and 
  on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the 
  faces of men. </p>
<p>9:8 <br>
  And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of 
  lions. </p>
<p>9:9 <br>
  And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of 
  their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. </p>
<p>9:10 <br>
  And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: 
  and their power was to hurt men five months. </p>
<p>9:11 <br>
  And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose 
  name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name 
  Apollyon. </p>
<p>9:12 <br>
  One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter. </p>
<p>9:13 <br>
  And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the 
  golden altar which is before God, </p>
<p>9:14 <br>
  Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which 
  are bound in the great river Euphrates. </p>
<p>9:15 <br>
  And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, 
  and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. </p>
<p>9:16 <br>
  And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: 
  and I heard the number of them. </p>
<p>9:17 <br>
  And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates 
  of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as 
  the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. 
</p>
<p>9:18 <br>
  By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, 
  and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. </p>
<p>9:19 <br>
  For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were 
  like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. </p>
<p>9:20 <br>
  And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented 
  not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols 
  of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, 
  nor hear, nor walk: </p>
<p>9:21 <br>
  Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their 
  fornication, nor of their thefts. </p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>10:1 <br>
  And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: 
  and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his 
  feet as pillars of fire: </p>
<p>10:2 <br>
  And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the 
  sea, and his left foot on the earth, </p>
<p>10:3 <br>
  And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, 
  seven thunders uttered their voices. </p>
<p>10:4 <br>
  And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: 
  and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the 
  seven thunders uttered, and write them not. </p>
<p>10:5 <br>
  And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his 
  hand to heaven, </p>
<p>10:6 <br>
  And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the 
  things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and 
  the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: 
</p>
<p>10:7 <br>
  But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, 
  the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the 
  prophets. </p>
<p>10:8 <br>
  And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and 
  take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon 
  the sea and upon the earth. </p>
<p>10:9 <br>
  And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he 
  said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but 
  it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. </p>
<p>10:10 <br>
  And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was 
  in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. 
</p>
<p>10:11 <br>
  And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, 
  and tongues, and kings. </p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>11:1 <br>
  And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, 
  Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. 
</p>
<p>11:2 <br>
  But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for 
  it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot 
  forty and two months. </p>
<p>11:3 <br>
  And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand 
  two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. </p>
<p>11:4 <br>
  These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the 
  God of the earth. </p>
<p>11:5 <br>
  And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth 
  their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. 
</p>
<p>11:6 <br>
  These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: 
  and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with 
  all plagues, as often as they will. </p>
<p>11:7 <br>
  And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth 
  out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, 
  and kill them. </p>
<p>11:8 <br>
  And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually 
  is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. </p>
<p>11:9 <br>
  And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their 
  dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to 
  be put in graves. </p>
<p>11:10 <br>
  And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, 
  and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them 
  that dwelt on the earth. </p>
<p>11:11 <br>
  And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, 
  and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. 
</p>
<p>11:12 <br>
  And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And 
  they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. </p>
<p>11:13 <br>
  And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city 
  fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant 
  were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. </p>
<p>11:14 <br>
  The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. </p>
<p>11:15 <br>
  And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, 
  The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; 
  and he shall reign for ever and ever. </p>
<p>11:16 <br>
  And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon 
  their faces, and worshipped God, </p>
<p>11:17 <br>
  Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art 
  to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. 
</p>
<p>11:18 <br>
  And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, 
  that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants 
  the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; 
  and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. </p>
<p>11:19 <br>
  And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple 
  the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, 
  and an earthquake, and great hail. </p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>12:1 <br>
  And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and 
  the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: </p>
<p>12:2 <br>
  And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. 
</p>
<p>12:3 <br>
  And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, 
  having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. </p>
<p>12:4 <br>
  And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to 
  the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, 
  for to devour her child as soon as it was born. </p>
<p>12:5 <br>
  And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of 
  iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. </p>
<p>12:6 <br>
  And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, 
  that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. 
</p>
<p>12:7 <br>
  And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; 
  and the dragon fought and his angels, </p>
<p>12:8 <br>
  And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. </p>
<p>12:9 <br>
  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, 
  which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels 
  were cast out with him. </p>
<p>12:10 <br>
  And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, 
  and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of 
  our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. 
</p>
<p>12:11 <br>
  And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; 
  and they loved not their lives unto the death. </p>
<p>12:12 <br>
  Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters 
  of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great 
  wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. </p>
<p>12:13 <br>
  And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman 
  which brought forth the man child. </p>
<p>12:14 <br>
  And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into 
  the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, 
  and half a time, from the face of the serpent. </p>
<p>12:15 <br>
  And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that 
  he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. </p>
<p>12:16 <br>
  And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed 
  up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. </p>
<p>12:17 <br>
  And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant 
  of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus 
  Christ. </p>

<p></p>
<p>13:1 <br>
  And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, 
  having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his 
  heads the name of blasphemy. </p>
<p>13:2 <br>
  And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the 
  feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him 
  his power, and his seat, and great authority. </p>
<p>13:3 <br>
  And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound 
  was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. </p>
<p>13:4 <br>
  And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped 
  the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with 
  him? </p>
<p>13:5 <br>
  And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; 
  and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. </p>
<p>13:6 <br>
  And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and 
  his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. </p>
<p>13:7 <br>
  And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: 
  and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. </p>
<p>13:8 <br>
  And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written 
  in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. </p>
<p>13:9 <br>
  If any man have an ear, let him hear. </p>
<p>13:10 <br>
  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with 
  the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith 
  of the saints. </p>
<p>13:11 <br>
  And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns 
  like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. </p>
<p>13:12 <br>
  And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the 
  earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly 
  wound was healed. </p>
<p>13:13 <br>
  And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on 
  the earth in the sight of men, </p>
<p>13:14 <br>
  And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which 
  he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the 
  earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a 
  sword, and did live. </p>
<p>13:15 <br>
  And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of 
  the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the 
  image of the beast should be killed. </p>
<p>13:16 <br>
  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive 
  a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: </p>
<p>13:17 <br>
  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of 
  the beast, or the number of his name. </p>
<p>13:18 <br>
  Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: 
  for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and 
  six. </p>

<p></p>
<p>14:1 <br>
  And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred 
  forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. 
</p>
<p>14:2 <br>
  And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice 
  of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: 
</p>
<p>14:3 <br>
  And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, 
  and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and 
  four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. </p>
<p>14:4 <br>
  These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These 
  are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from 
  among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. </p>
<p>14:5 <br>
  And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the 
  throne of God. </p>
<p>14:6 <br>
  And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel 
  to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, 
  and tongue, and people, </p>
<p>14:7 <br>
  Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his 
  judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, 
  and the fountains of waters. </p>
<p>14:8 <br>
  And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that 
  great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her 
  fornication. </p>
<p>14:9 <br>
  And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship 
  the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, 
</p>
<p>14:10 <br>
  The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without 
  mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire 
  and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the 
  Lamb: </p>
<p>14:11 <br>
  And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have 
  no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth 
  the mark of his name. </p>
<p>14:12 <br>
  Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments 
  of God, and the faith of Jesus. </p>
<p>14:13 <br>
  And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead 
  which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may 
  rest from their labours; and their works do follow them. </p>
<p>14:14 <br>
  And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto 
  the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. 
</p>
<p>14:15 <br>
  And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that 
  sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee 
  to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. </p>
<p>14:16 <br>
  And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth 
  was reaped. </p>
<p>14:17 <br>
  And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having 
  a sharp sickle. </p>
<p>14:18 <br>
  And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried 
  with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp 
  sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are 
  fully ripe. </p>
<p>14:19 <br>
  And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of 
  the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. </p>
<p>14:20 <br>
  And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, 
  even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

  Chapter 15</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>15:1 <br>
  And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having 
  the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God. </p>
<p>15:2 <br>
  And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten 
  the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over 
  the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. 
</p>
<p>15:3 <br>
  And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, 
  saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true 
  are thy ways, thou King of saints. </p>
<p>15:4 <br>
  Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: 
  for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made 
  manifest. </p>
<p>15:5 <br>
  And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony 
  in heaven was opened: </p>
<p>15:6 <br>
  And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed 
  in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. 
</p>
<p>15:7 <br>
  And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full 
  of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. </p>
<p>15:8 <br>
  And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; 
  and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the 
  seven angels were fulfilled. </p>

  Chapter 16</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>16:1 <br>
  And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your 
  ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth. </p>
<p>16:2 <br>
  And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a 
  noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and 
  upon them which worshipped his image. </p>
<p>16:3 <br>
  And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the 
  blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea. </p>
<p>16:4 <br>
  And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; 
  and they became blood. </p>
<p>16:5 <br>
  And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, 
  and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. </p>
<p>16:6 <br>
  For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them 
  blood to drink; for they are worthy. </p>
<p>16:7 <br>
  And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and 
  righteous are thy judgments. </p>
<p>16:8 <br>
  And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto 
  him to scorch men with fire. </p>
<p>16:9 <br>
  And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which 
  hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. </p>
<p>16:10 <br>
  And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his 
  kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, </p>
<p>16:11 <br>
  And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and 
  repented not of their deeds. </p>
<p>16:12 <br>
  And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and 
  the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might 
  be prepared. </p>
<p>16:13 <br>
  And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, 
  and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 
</p>
<p>16:14 <br>
  For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the 
  kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that 
  great day of God Almighty. </p>
<p>16:15 <br>
  Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, 
  lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. </p>
<p>16:16 <br>
  And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. 
</p>
<p>16:17 <br>
  And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great 
  voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. </p>
<p>16:18 <br>
  And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, 
  such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and 
  so great. </p>
<p>16:19 <br>
  And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations 
  fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the 
  cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. </p>
<p>16:20 <br>
  And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. </p>
<p>16:21 <br>
  And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight 
  of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the 
  plague thereof was exceeding great. </p>

  Chapter 17</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>17:1 <br>
  And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked 
  with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of 
  the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: </p>
<p>17:2 <br>
  With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants 
  of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. </p>
<p>17:3 <br>
  So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit 
  upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads 
  and ten horns. </p>
<p>17:4 <br>
  And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold 
  and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations 
  and filthiness of her fornication: </p>
<p>17:5 <br>
  And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER 
  OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. </p>
<p>17:6 <br>
  And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood 
  of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. 
</p>
<p>17:7 <br>
  And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the 
  mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven 
  heads and ten horns. </p>
<p>17:8 <br>
  The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless 
  pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose 
  names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, 
  when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. </p>
<p>17:9 <br>
  And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, 
  on which the woman sitteth. </p>
<p>17:10 <br>
  And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not 
  yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. </p>
<p>17:11 <br>
  And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, 
  and goeth into perdition. </p>
<p>17:12 <br>
  And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom 
  as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. </p>
<p>17:13 <br>
  These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. 
</p>
<p>17:14 <br>
  These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he 
  is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, 
  and chosen, and faithful. </p>
<p>17:15 <br>
  And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, 
  are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. </p>
<p>17:16 <br>
  And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, 
  and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her 
  with fire. </p>
<p>17:17 <br>
  For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give 
  their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. </p>
<p>17:18 <br>
  And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the 
  kings of the earth. </p>

<p></p>
<p>18:1 <br>
  And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great 
  power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. </p>
<p>18:2 <br>
  And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, 
  is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul 
  spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. </p>
<p>18:3 <br>
  For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and 
  the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants 
  of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. </p>
<p>18:4 <br>
  And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that 
  ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. </p>
<p>18:5 <br>
  For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 
</p>
<p>18:6 <br>
  Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to 
  her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double. </p>
<p>18:7 <br>
  How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment 
  and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, 
  and shall see no sorrow. </p>
<p>18:8 <br>
  Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; 
  and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth 
  her. </p>
<p>18:9 <br>
  And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously 
  with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke 
  of her burning, </p>
<p>18:10 <br>
  Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great 
  city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come. </p>
<p>18:11 <br>
  And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth 
  their merchandise any more: </p>
<p>18:12 <br>
  The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and 
  fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all 
  manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of 
  brass, and iron, and marble, </p>
<p>18:13 <br>
  And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, 
  and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, 
  and slaves, and souls of men. </p>
<p>18:14 <br>
  And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things 
  which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them 
  no more at all. </p>
<p>18:15 <br>
  The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar 
  off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, </p>
<p>18:16 <br>
  And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and 
  purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! 
</p>
<p>18:17 <br>
  For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and 
  all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar 
  off, </p>
<p>18:18 <br>
  And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like 
  unto this great city! </p>
<p>18:19 <br>
  And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, 
  alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by 
  reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate. </p>
<p>18:20 <br>
  Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath 
  avenged you on her. </p>
<p>18:21 <br>
  And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into 
  the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown 
  down, and shall be found no more at all. </p>
<p>18:22 <br>
  And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall 
  be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, 
  shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard 
  no more at all in thee; </p>
<p>18:23 <br>
  And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice 
  of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for 
  thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all 
  nations deceived. </p>
<p>18:24 <br>
  And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were 
  slain upon the earth. </p>

<p>19:1 <br>
  And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, 
  Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: 
</p>
<p>19:2 <br>
  For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, 
  which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood 
  of his servants at her hand. </p>
<p>19:3 <br>
  And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. </p>
<p>19:4 <br>
  And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped 
  God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. </p>
<p>19:5 <br>
  And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, 
  and ye that fear him, both small and great. </p>
<p>19:6 <br>
  And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many 
  waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord 
  God omnipotent reigneth. </p>
<p>19:7 <br>
  Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the 
  Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. </p>

  And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: 
  for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. </p>

  supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. 
</p>
<p>19:10 <br>

  I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: 
  worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. </p>
<p>19:11 <br>
  And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him 
  was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. 
</p>
<p>19:12 <br>
  His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had 
  a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. </p>
<p>19:13 <br>
  And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The 
  Word of God. </p>
<p>19:14 <br>
  And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed 
  in fine linen, white and clean. </p>
<p>19:15 <br>
  And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: 
  and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of

  And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND 
  LORD OF LORDS. </p>

  That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh 
  of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the 
  flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. </p>
<p>19:19 <br>
  And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered 
  together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. 
</p>
<p>19:20 <br>
  And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles 
  before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, 
  and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of 
  fire burning with brimstone. </p>

  And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which 
  sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, 
  and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake

  Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, 
  even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; </p>
<p>21:12 <br>
  And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve 
  angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes 
  of the children of Israel: </p>
<p>21:13 <br>
  On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; 
  and on the west three gates. </p>
<p>21:14 <br>
  And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the 
  twelve apostles of the Lamb. </p>
<p>21:15 <br>
  And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates 
  thereof, and the wall thereof. </p>
<p>21:16 <br>
  And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and 
  he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and 
  the breadth and the height of it are equal. </p>
<p>21:17 <br>
  And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according 
  to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. </p>
<p>21:18 <br>
  And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, 
  like unto clear glass. </p>
<p>21:19 <br>
  And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of 
  precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the 
  third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; </p>
<p>21:20 <br>
  The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, 
  beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; 
  the twelfth, an amethyst. </p>
<p>21:21 <br>
  And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: 
  and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. </p>
<p>21:22 <br>
  And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the 
  temple of it. </p>
<p>21:23 <br>
  And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for 
  the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. </p>
<p>21:24 <br>
  And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the 
  kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. </p>
<p>21:25 <br>
  And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night 
  there. </p>
<p>21:26 <br>
  And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. </p>
<p>21:27 <br>
  And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever 
  worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's 
  book of life. </p>

  Chapter 22</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>22:1 <br>
  And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding 
  out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. </p>
<p>22:2 <br>
  In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there 
  the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit 
  every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 
</p>
<p>22:3 <br>
  And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall 
  be in it; and his servants shall serve him: </p>
<p>22:4 <br>
  And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads. </p>
<p>22:5 <br>
  And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of 
  the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and 
  ever. </p>
<p>22:6 <br>
  And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of 
  the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which 
  must shortly be done. </p>
<p>22:7 <br>
  Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy 
  of this book. </p>
<p>22:8 <br>
  And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, 
  I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. 
</p>
<p>22:9 <br>
  Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of 
  thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: 
  worship God. </p>
<p>22:10 <br>
  And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for 
  the time is at hand. </p>
<p>22:11 <br>
  He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him 
  be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he 
  that is holy, let him be holy still. </p>
<p>22:12 <br>
  And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according 
  as his work shall be. </p>
<p>22:13 <br>
  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. </p>
<p>22:14 <br>
  Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree 
  of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. </p>
<p>22:15 <br>
  For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, 
  and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie. </p>
<p>22:16 <br>
  I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. 
  I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. </p>
<p>22:17 <br>
  And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. 
  And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water 
  of life freely. </p>
<p>22:18 <br>
  For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this 
  book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues 
  that are written in this book: </p>
<p>22:19 <br>
  And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, 
  God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, 
  and from the things which are written in this book. </p>
<p>22:20 <br>
  He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, 
  come, Lord Jesus. </p>
<p>22:21 <br>
  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. </p>
