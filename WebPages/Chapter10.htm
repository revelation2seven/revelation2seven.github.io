    welfare of the city to which I have exiled you and pray for it to the Almighty, 
    for through its welfare will you have welfare.&quot; This has been a cornerstone

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Maimonides wrote this Letter to 
    the Jewish Community of Yemen almost 1,000 years ago]</font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And as King Solomon knew with divine 
    inspiration that the Jewish People would face the consequences of this and 
    that suffering would come upon them, and warned the Jewish People not to do 
    this (i.e. violate the Three Oaths), and in a metaphorical way made them swear 
    not to commit these acts, as it is written in Song of Songs, 3,5: I made you 
    swear Daughters of Jerusalem by the deer and gazelles of the field should 
    you not arouse or awaken love until it is so desired. </font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, you, dear brethren, 
    must accept the Oath and do not attempt to arouse the love until the proper 
    time when the Alm-ghty shall remember us and you with his trait of mercy to 
    gather his portion from Exile to behold his glory at his holy Temple and redeem 
    us from the Valley of the shadow of Death where he has placed us, THEREBY 
    REMOVING THE DARKNESS FROM OUR EYES AND THE FOG FROM OUR HEARTS. HE WILL THEN 
    FULFILL IN OUR DAYS AND IN YOURS THE VERSE FROM ISAIAH 9:1 The nation wandering 
    in darkness shall see a great Light, and a Light shall shine on those residing 
    in the land of the shadow of death. At that time G-d shall darken the eyes 
    of all those who rise up against us, and fulfill the verse from Isaiah 9:2 
    Verily darkness shall cover the land and fog shall cover nations, but the 
    light of G-d shall shine upon you, and you shall display his honor.</font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Maharal of Prague (Rabbi Betzalel 
    Lowy who lived in the 17th century) explained that the prohibition of violating 
    the Three Oaths applies even if the other nations force the Jewish People 
    to do so.</font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, he wrote in his book 
    Netzach Yisroel (Chapter 24) that these Oaths may not be modified so as to 
    affect the decree of Exile, and he expanded on the description in the Midrashic 
    text on Song of Songs 2:18.</font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;Even if the nations wanted 
    to kill the Jews with terrible torture, the Jews are forbidden to change the 
    applicability of the Oaths. This is relevant to every one of these oaths and 
    must be understood.&#148; Therefore, not only is it forbidden to leave the 
    Exile even with the permission of the nations, but even if they force the 
    Jewish People to do so under pain of death, it is forbidden to violate these 
    Oaths in the same way it is required to give up one&#146;s life rather than 
    accept another religion.</font></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rabbi Avraham Galanti, who other 
    rabbis described as outstanding in his level of holiness, and who was a student 
    of the great kabbalist Rabbi Moshe Cordovero in the 16th century, explained 
    aspects of the Three Oaths in his book Zechus Avos [Merit of the Patriarchs] 
    where he recounts how some Jews in Portugal wanted to revolt against the kingdom 
    rather than submit to forced conversion. A rabbi quoted the verses from Song 
    of Songs to the people who wanted to revolt, and pointed to the Talmudic tractate 
    Ketuboth p. 111 which states that G-d made the Jewish People take three Oaths 
    &#150; one was that they should not rebel against G-d by rebelling against 
    the nations. Thereafter the Jews submitted to death rather than forced conversion. 
    Although the description in Ketuboth does not say that the Oaths involve directly 
    rebelling against G-d, it is clear that the very violation of these Oaths 
    is rebellion against G-d himself. </font>Jews Against Zionism.com</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There are two obvious conclusions 
    that emerge from the death march of the last decade. First, there is no peace 
    and there will not be peace, notwithstanding all of our good intentions. There 
    will be no peace, not in our generation, perhaps not for several generations, 
    and perhaps not until the Messianic era...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'There will be no peace' is a reality 
    that has to penetrate our psyches. We should recognize it and deal with it...We 
    must avoid falling into the trap of thinking that 'now if we only make more 
    concessions, then peace will come.' Peace is not coming, no matter what we 
    do. This realization calls for a major paradigm shift, an abrupt change in 
    focus, and an end to the lies and prattle that constitute political discourse 
    in the Jewish world. Peace is not coming! Jews, get used to it...The disappointment 
    is intense, because our expectations were so high. We thought Israel was the 
    end of the exile, instead of the same old exile in another form and venue.</font></p>

    Jewish people dwelling in the land of Israel according to the laws of the

    realize that we rely upon our Father in Heaven, and His abundant compassion.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Mukti: We are confused, lost, 
    searching. Strange images that I have encountered in the kabbalah were not 
    as strange as the history around me, as this twentieth century of ours. Did 
    the kabbalah feed your inner world--you have lived through such stormy years 
    in such a strange world?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scholem: I can't say. Maybe it 
    fed me more than I'm willing to admit. I suppose that I considered kabbalah 
    as one of the possibilities for Jewish survival in history, that gave a dimension 
    of depth to those who decided to remain Jews. I saw that there was something 
    to kabbalah, but I didn't see it as the be-all and end-all. I was not out 
    to be a promoter of kabbalah but to state what I understood and did not understand. 
    Historical processes generally lead to quite different results than they seemed 
    headed to at the outset.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cannot say that if I decided 
    today on matters of principle, I would decide according to the instructions 
    of the kabbalists...I don't think the Talmud will help us much (either), even 
    though I am far from denigrating the Talmud...But I don't think that the Talmud 
    or the kabbalah will provide us with the answers to the fateful questions

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mukti: I was not referring to the 
    political-messianic dimensions but to a different aesthetic aspect--to the 
    linguistic style of our strange era. The kabbalists were struggling with ineffable 
    things--the sense of chaos all around--and precisely this speaks to us, even 
    though it was written in a different conceptual world than ours.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scholem: If you ask me, I say that 
    the kabbalists had a fundamental feeling that there is a mystery--a secret--in 
    the world. The world is also--but not only--what is apparent to us...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modern man lives in a private world 
    of his own, enclosed within himself; and modern symbolism is not objective: 
    it is private; it does not obligate. The symbols of the kabbalists, on the 
    other hand, did not only speak to the private individual, they displayed a 
    symbolic dimension to the whole world. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IN THE REALITY 
    IN WHICH TODAY'S SECULAR PERSON LIVES, THIS DIMENSION WILL BE REVEALED AGAIN...</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;A new sense of Jewish peoplehood 
    had begun to dawn upon Herzl at the end of 1891, when his paper assigned him 
    as a correspondent in Paris. In the ensuing years the public agitation over 
    the Panama scandal and the trial of Captain Dryfus demonstrated to a young 
    man already troubled by the persistence of anti-Semitism in Austria and Germany 
    that there were no limits upon this disease if it could so virulently infect 
    even the land of the great revolution. His imagination began seeking dramatic 
    cures--first in the form of a play, then in thoughts of a novel, and finally 
    in succession of plans for some grand 'coup de theatre' on the stage of life 
    itself. Soon he had vaguely formulated a scheme for the mass regeneration 
    of European Jews and their emigration to some distant land where they could 
    form a political entity...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Herzl soon found himself with a 
    succession of invitations. One was from the chief Ashkenazi rabbi of the British 
    Empire...with whom conversation was easy since he was a native of Germany. 
    On Saturday evening, after the close of the Sabbath, Herzl was among a handful 
    of guests invited to dinner at Rabbi Adler's home. Over glasses of red wine...he 
    expounded his ideas...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At lunch at (one Sir Samuel Montagu's 
    home), Herzl had a glimpse of the synthesis of traditions that had been uniquely 
    achieved by the aristocrats of English Jewry. 'A house of English elegance 
    in grand style,'...'Kosher food, served by three liveried footmen.' In the 
    smoking room afterward, Herzl unfolded his scheme. Sir Samuel...was aroused 
    to enthusiasm AND ENVISIONED SETTLING IN PALESTINE WITH HIS WHOLE FAMILY; 
    he would not even consider Argentina, which Herzl still regarded as a possibility. 
    He was ready to join in, he said, 'AS SOON AS ONE OF THE GREAT POWERS TAKES 
    THE MATTER SERIOUSLY.' </font>(Understand Matthew 24)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That evening Herzl spoke before 
    the Maccabeans, AN ORGANIZATIONS OF INTELLECTUALS dedicated to the spread 
    of Jewish culture. Zangwell was prominently involved in it, and Colonel Goldsmid 
    was a former president. Herzl was unanimously elected an honorary member...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Goldsmid rejected Argentina out 
    of hand and insisted 'that only Palestine could be considered.' HE ARGUED 
    THAT THE 'PIOUS CHRISTIANS OF ENGLAND WOULD HELP US IF WE WENT TO PALESTINE. 
    FOR THEY EXPECT THE COMING OF MESIAH AFTER THE JEWS RETURNED HOME.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Herzl concluded his English stay 
    with a visit to the London home of Rabbi Singer...Among (others there) was 
    Asher Myers, editor of the Jewish Chronicle of London, the august weekly that 
    had been the journalistic spokesman for English Jewry since 1841. Myers had 
    his doubts about Herzl and disliked his lack of religious commitment; nevertheless 
    he asked Herzl to send him a summary of the pamphlet he was then preparing...Herzl 
    did so after he got back to Paris, with the result that, in January 1896, 
    Herzl's plan made its first appearance in print in the pages of the Jewish 
    Chronicle. His full-length bid to change history, 'Der Judenstaat' (The Jewish 
    State), was published IN VIENNA the following month...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Jewish nationalist student 
    circles of his own Vienna--within which the term Zionism had recently been 
    coined--took warmly to his ideas and personality and through their network 
    of contacts began promoting their goal of a general Zionist congress...Ordinary 
    Jewish folks wrote him letters of thanks, even as (others) denounced his stress 
    on Jewish nationality over religion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Important political contacts had 
    also come about. The Reverend William Hechler, chaplain to the British embassy 
    in Vienna and author of the pamphlet called 'The Restoration of the Jews to 
    Palestine According to the Prophets,' had presented himself to Herzl in March...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the ensuing year, Herzl, indefatigably 
    speaking, writing, traveling, organizing--succeeded in creating a mass movement. 
    And on August 29, 1897, a dream was realized: the First Zionist Congress assembled 
    in Basel for three days of deliberation...(Other voices in Judaism were) withering 
    before the overwhelming personality of the 'marvelous and exalted figure'--in 
    the words of one witness--who stood before the congress in frock coat and 
    white tie: 'It is no longer the elegant Dr. Herzl of Vienna; IT IS THE ROYAL 
    SCION OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID, risen from among the dead, clothed in legend 
    and fantasy and beauty.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for Herzl himself, he went home 
    at the end of the congress and wrote in his diary: 'At Basel I founded the 
    Jewish State...Perhaps in five years, and certainly in fifty, everyone will

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The true reason for the agitation 
    raised by the Zionists who deceive and incite the people of Israel away from 
    the Lord and away from His holy Torah, is that THE FEEBLE LIMBS OF THE BODY 
    OF ISRAEL were already mingled among the nations and joined with them. A Jew 
    of this kind who in Germany regarded himself as a German, and in Austria as 
    an Austrian, etc., and felt that he belonged to his native land and had a

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Berel Wein</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today being Jerusalem Day--<i>Yom 
    Yerushalayim</i>--my thoughts naturally tend toward contemplating this sacred 
    and scarred city. When I refer to the two Jerusalems in the title of this 
    article, I do not intend to imply any territorial, demographic, or political 
    division of the city. Rather I am referring to the classic Two Jerusalems 
    of Jewish tradition--THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM AND THE EARTHLY JERUSALEM.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The heavenly Jerusalem is the Jerusalem 
    of our dreams and hopes--the perfect society and MOST BEAUTIFUL CITY IN THE 
    WORLD; a harmonious place where tolerance, goodwill, and common sense reign. 
    Heavenly Jerusalem is the repository of all our memories and our eternal destiny, 
    the reaffirmation of our traditions and religious beliefs and observances, 
    the utopian MESSIANIC JERUSALEM.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then there is the Earthly Jerusalem...There 
    are suicide bombers that destroy its buses and murder its innocent citizens, 
    and the promised canopy of peace of the Hebrew prayer book has yet to be spread 
    over its environs. The Earthly Jerusalem is also home to religious fanatics, 
    and its population is one of the poorest in all Israel. Yet Earthly Jerusalem 
    also contains many and great yeshivot, and Torah is studied everywhere in 
    the city by all groups and ages of Jews...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has become increasingly clear 
    that those who no longer have a vision of the Heavenly Jerusalem have also 
    loosened their ties to Earthly Jerusalem. Ehud Barak's wild gamble with the 
    Temple Mount and a redivision of Jerusalem is an example of this...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was the Heavenly Jerusalem with 
    its fantasy and pristine unreality that helped create the grimy, real, pulsating 
    Jerusalem of our time. The founders of the State were non-observant, and many 
    of them were anti-religious. But they came from a Jewish existence in the 
    Diaspora that remained imbued with the idea of JERUSALEM AS THE CENTRAL CITY 
    IN THE JEWISH WORLD. They still had a glimpse of Heavenly Jerusalem tucked 
    away in their memory.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ben-Gurion fought to make Jerusalem 
    the capital of the country. Later in the Six-Day War, the Jewish title to 
    Jerusalem was restored in blood and tears and joy and hope. The nonJewish 
    world, which never acknowledged the existence of the Heavenly Jerusalem still 
    refuses to recognize the Earthly Jerusalem as well...Without an ability to 
    explain the Jewish vision of the Heavenly Jerusalem to the world, our rights 
    to Earthly Jerusalem will always remain contested and contentious...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All Jews--secular, religious, and 
    all shades in between--should realize that it is only the idea and belief 
    in the Heavenly Jerusalem that allows the Earthly jerusalem to continue to 
    grow, build and prosper. I am certain that the Heavenly Jerusalem extends 
    to the Earthly Jerusalem its blessings on this Jerusalem Day.</font></p>

    significance </font>(writes I. Domb in <i>The Transformation</i>)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    of the fact that at the time when Hitler's Germany was fighting for its life, 
    and when every pair of hands were needed for the war effort, he preferred 
    to destroy six-million Jews who would have been only too willing to be obedient 
    slaves in Hitler's war machine in return for their lives?...Why did Hitler 
    feel impelled, to withdraw tens of thousands of S.S. brutes from the fighting 
    line in order to employ them in his devilish extermination process at Auschwitz 
    and Treblinka, in order to destroy the very source of manpower which might 
    have brought him great advantages and the attainment of victory? Which of 
    us, while pondering over these facts can fail to see the relevance to them 
    of these unforgettable verses in Deuteronomy:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="+1"></font></i></font><i><font size="+1">For 
    a fire flames in my wrath, and shall blaze unto the lowest hell, and shall 
    consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundation of the 
    mountains. I will exhaust my evils upon them: I will spend my arrows upon 
    them. They shall be emaciated with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, 
    and with bitter destruction: I will also send forth the teeth of wild beasts 
    upon them, with fury of those crawling in the dust. The sword without, and 
    horror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling 
    with the man of gray hairs. O that they were wise, that they understood this, 
    that they would consider their latter end; except that G-d had sold them, 
    and the Eternal has delivered them.</font></i></p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">And the glory of the Lord of Israel was gone up from the

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The application of these verses 
    to a work of destruction calculated from every point of view--moral, political, 
    propaganda, military, and economic--to hinder everything else that Hitler 
    hoped to achieve, was clear to some of Hitler's victims. A young rabbinical 
    scholar, who suffered <a href="../UsedImages/Wiesel.gif">in Auschwitz</a>, 
    once seized the opportunity of asking his S.S. torturer why he was behaving 
    in that way and received the reply: 'I don't know, I am just obeying orders.' 
    When he was asked what was the purpose of these orders, he said: 'They don't 
    know themselves.' The rabbinical scholar made the following instructive comment 
    on this conversation: 'After that I could no longer see S.S. and gas chambers 
    in Auschwitz, but I could see only verses from the Bible, moving in front 
    of my eyes in the full living horror of their fulfillment.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only this recent catastrophe 
    but the whole path of blood and tears leading throughout the long exile cannot 
    be understood otherwise; but Zionism, with its atheistic approach has desecrated 
    all the holy and fundamental truths, diverted the Jewish way of thought into 
    a temporal direction and marched roughshod over the ideals and values, and 
    beliefs sacred to the Jewish people. Instead of drawing the right conclusions 
    and accepting the manifestation of G-d's will as a rebuke, they deliberately 
    took advantage of the confusion which reigned after that stunning blow, to 
    exploit it for their own political ends which are, in fact, the very reverse 
    of those designed for His people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mighty Zionist propaganda machine 
    set to work soon after the conflagration to distort and misinterpret the meaning 
    of the event by allegedly logical reasoning. 'This happened,' they shouted 
    from the rooftops, 'because the Zionist idea was not accepted long ago; because 
    we did not have the means to defend ourselves and to fight back; we must therefore

    the afternoon, August 16, 1949, when an airplane, flown by an American pilot, 
    appeared over the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Immediately it was joined 
    by four fighter planes from the Israeli air force. That day this plane had 
    flown from Austria. It carried the remains of a Jew who had died forty five 
    years before and whose body slept quietly, all these years, wrapped in a blue 
    and white flag of Zion, in a cemetery in Vienna...And now, in 1949, only one 
    year after the new State of Israel had been formed, the body of that man was 
    being brought to Israel, where it would lie in the sacred soil of Mount Herzl 
    outside of Jerusalem.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DECLARATION BY JEWS 
  OPPOSED TO ZIONISM</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The Definition of the Neturei 
    Karta group.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Neturei Karta group is a spearhead 
    group within the Jewish People, who are prepared to stand up and express openly 
    a religious and humanitarian philosophy held in essence by large numbers (hundreds 
    of thousands) and possibly the majority of authentic Orthodox Jews. A philosophy 
    totally opposed to the attitude adopted by the Zionists and to Zionism as 
    a whole.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The philosophy in essence is that 
    for the last two thousand years or so the Jewish people have been in a state 
    of exile decreed by the A-lmighty. The Jews were exiled from their land because 
    they did not maintain the standards expected of them. This state of exile 
    is the situation that exists right up to the present day. It is a basic part 
    of our belief to accept willingly the Heavenly decree of exile and not to 
    try and fight against it or to end it by our own hands. In practical terms, 
    exile for us means that Jews must be loyal subjects of the countries in which 
    they live and not attempt to rule over the established indigenous populations 
    of those countries. And of course this includes Palestine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zionist movement founded approximately 
    100 years ago based on secular nationalistic aims, was a complete abandonment 
    of our religious teachings and faith - in general - and in particular regarding 
    our approach to our state of exile and to the peoples among whom we live.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Neturei Karta's position towards 
    Israel</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ideology of Zionism is to take 
    the law into ones own hands and to try to force the outcome in the form of 
    a State irrespective of the cost in life and property to anyone who stands 
    in the way. The Palestinians stood in the way.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The practical outcome of Zionism 
    in the form of the State known as 'Israel' is completely alien to Judaism 
    and the Jewish Faith and has been and continues to be the cause of untold 
    suffering and bloodshed both Jewish and non-Jewish. The apparent connection 
    between Judaism and Zionism is false. The connection has been nurtured by 
    the Zionists in order to ensnare as many Jews as possible within their net.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the Torah and Jewish 
    faith, the present Palestinian Arab claim to rule in Palestine is right and 
    just. The Zionist claim is wrong and criminal. It follows, therefore, that 
    the Jewish people have no right to rule today in Palestine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One must add to this wrong, the 
    fact that in order to achieve an ill conceived nationalistic ambition, a shocking 
    contravention of natural and humanitarian justice was committed by the Zionists 
    in setting up an illegitimate regime in Palestine completely against the wishes 
    of the established population, the Palestinians, which inevitably had to be 
    based on loss of life, killing and stealing. Our attitude to Israel is that 
    the whole concept is flawed and illegitimate. It is a tragedy for the Palestinians 
    and also for the Jewish people.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Neturei Karta's position towards 
    Zionist Jews</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zionists have made themselves 
    to appear as the representatives and spokespeople of all Jews thus, with their 
    actions arousing animosity against the Jews. But, this is simply not true! 
    Zionism is not Judaism. Zionists cannot speak in the name of Jews. Although, 
    it must be remembered that a large number of people living within the Zionist 
    State are there by force of circumstances and are by no means ideological 
    Zionists. Their support for the Zionist State is by force of habit and circumstance. 
    They would be quite happy to live under a Muslim regime if they would be allowed 
    to do so in safety.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Neturei Karta's position towards 
    Muslims and Arabs</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The connection between Muslims 
    and Jews goes right back into ancient history. Mostly the relationship was 
    friendly and mutually beneficial. Historically, the situation frequently was 
    that when Jews were being persecuted in Europe they found refuge in the various 
    Muslim countries. Our attitude to Muslims and Arabs can only be one of friendliness 
    and respect.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To sum up. We consider the Palestinians 
    as the people with the right to govern in Palestine. The Zionist oppression, 
    abuse and murder of Arabs is a tragedy not only for the Palestinians but for 
    the Jewish people as well. The continuing existence of the Zionist State is 
    the underlying cause of the strife in Palestine.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It must be clear that opposition 
    to Zionism and its crimes does not imply hatred of Jews. On the contrary Zionism 
    itself and its deeds are the biggest threat to Judaism. Governments of the 
    world should realise that supporting Zionists and Zionism is not helping Jews 
    or Judaism but only perpetuates the tragic impasse and constant bloodshed 
    in the Middle East. We are waiting for the annulment of Zionism and the dismantling 
    of the Zionist regime, and would welcome the opportunity to dwell in peace 
    in the holy land under a rule which is entirely in accordance with the wishes 
    of the Palestinian People. We pray for a solution to the terrible and tragic 
    impasse that exists. Hopefully based on results brought about by moral, political 
    and economic pressures imposed by the nations of the world.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Crowds of jeering, cursing American Zionists were held at bay 
  by police barricades at a recent demonstration in support of the state of Israel 
  in New York City. The demonstration was held in front of the Israeli Consulate, 
  near the United Nations, and barracades were in place to separate the crowds 
  from a small, courageous group of Neturei Karta who had appeared to state the 
  Jewish cause. The four orthodox Jews, who were holding up signs in support of 
  Palestinian rights, and against the Israeli occupation of that land, had to 
  be whisked away in a taxi so that they would not have to walk through the thick 
  of that (violent) mob. </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When we see how the whole 
    Torah is neglected and even annulled by a large section of Jewry </font>(and 
    may we add Christians)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> in our day, 
    and to a lesser extent in other generations, somehow we find ourselves all 
    the more unable to understand how the process will eventually be resolved. 
    What one part of Jewry seeks to remedy, the other seeks to spoil, and the 
    devastation seems much greater than the extent of the remedy. The devastation 
    seems to be leading in a completely different direction and we are unable 
    to see any change for good. On the contrary, we see things leading to an even 
    steeper decline.</font><b> </b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we think of all the calamities, 
    the slaughters and the persecutions the Jews have suffered throughout the 
    generations, and especially the experiences of our own generation...WE CANNOT 
    REALLY SEE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH ALL THESE CALAMITIES ARE LEADING, NOR CAN 
    WE GRASP WHAT ALLL THIS SUFFERING IS MEANT TO ACHIEVE NOR THE CAUSE OF IT, 
    NOR THE WAY IT IS GOING TO END.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is difficult to suppose that 
    all these sufferings and afflictions are leading the suffering Jewish people 
    to repentance or to an improved observance of the Torah. We cannot see this 
    at all clearly if we look at the history of previous sufferings, and we certainly 
    cannot see it today. All this adds to our bewilderment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WE CAN BE SURE THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS 
    IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIVINE PLAN, and that all the afflictions have been 
    stirred in motion in accordance with that plan. We can be sure on the authority 
    of the Torah that there is eventual good in all these sufferings and that 
    they are not, Heaven forbid, merely a matter of vengeance and punishment for 
    sins and evil deeds. Of course there is a close connection between the sufferings 
    of the Jewish people and sins and transgressions committed against the Torah, 
    but we cannot believe that the punishments inflicted on the Jews for those 
    sins constitute an end in themselves. We believe that the punishment does 
    not end in punishment, but that there is something further that comes afterward...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shem Yisborach (G-d, May His Name 
    be Blessed) is fulfilling His aim in every detail, but that aim permits of 
    two alternatives leading to the same ultimate end. One path is speedy and 
    even, the most convenient of paths, the path of the Torah and Commandments. 
    That is to say, from our observance of the Torah there can be created all 
    the illuminations and remedies constituting the Remedy of the World. WHEN 
    ALL THE LEVELS OF SANCTITY HAVE BEEN REACHED ACCORDING TO THEIR MEASURE, THE 
    FINAL DESTINY WILL BE FULFILLED, THE DESTINY OF THE COMING OF THE MESSIAH 
    AND ALL THE GREAT EXPERIENCES OF EXALTATION RESULTING FROM IT.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE REMEDY OF THE WORLD IS A DIVINE 
    MATTER, A MATTER OF DIVINE COMPLETION ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL LEADING TO THE 
    DIVINE MATTERS WHICH WILL THEN BE REVEALED. It will be accomplished by great 
    material benefits, but the detailed content of the whole matter, as well as 
    the content of the Torah and Commandments in quality and quantity which will 
    be required to constitute the Light of Messiah and, the whole Remedy of the 
    World, are known only to Shem Yisborach.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The general faith that is spread 
    and proclaimed by the Nation of Israel through our sages, and those upon whom 
    the Holy Spirit has descended, holds, that Torah and the Commandments constitute 
    the material from which the ultimate end is constructed. Apart from the individual 
    reward, which every Jew will receive for his fulfillment of Torah and Commandments 
    in this world and in the next, the sum total of the sanctity acquired by all 
    generations, all the good deeds of the Jews, and all Jewish attempts to approach 
    nearer to Shem Yisborach, combine to form that great Light. Torah and Commandments 
    bring sanctity into the life of every individual Jew and, out of a unity of 
    all these individual acquisitions of sanctity, the whole world will be sanctified 
    with a general sanctity. This process is continuing the whole time unnoticed. 
    But the time will come when the process will be revealed to every living person.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Christian evangelicals speak of religious Jews from a distance 
  (and perhaps they have no choice), but also with an air of self-certainty, as 
  well as a measure of dishonesty, because they also believe it is these Jews, 
  as well as the present nation of Israel, and not themselves, who still have 
  a final spiritual lesson to learn. (After all, it is they who are to be &quot;raptured&quot; 
  away while the Jews and the rest of us are left here to experience the &quot;tribulations&quot; 
  of the last times). And Jews speak of Jews, and to Jews, well, as <a href="../UsedImages/pg17topisaiahweb2.gif">if 
  Christians did not exist</a>, and as if they, or at least a remnant of them, 
  had nothing whatsoever to do with the redemption of Israel. I. Domb, however, 
  has touched the truth of it all (and, it is quite certain, not with the hidden 
  doctrines of Christianity in mind), when he says that &quot;the whole world 
  will (begin to) be sanctified with a general sanctity at the coming of Messiah.&quot; 
  It is only then that the true Israel will be manifest, both to itself and the 
  world. And though it will thoroughly repent before the other peoples of the 
  world for all of the evils that have been accomplished in the name of G-d, and 
  though it will recommit itself to its own high calling--as bearer of the oracles 
  of God, and servant to the peoples of the world--it will not ask permission 
  from the other nations of the world to exist in the same way as the Zionist 
  State did in 1948. As every child is born from its own Mother's womb, so the 
  true Holy Nation will have no choice but to come into existence. Divine Nature 
  is already rising up in all of Her manifestations to compel it to exist. In 
  fact the Universal Nation itself is named after Her...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The name &quot;Israel&quot; (Yod, Shin, Resh, Alef, Lamed), 
  is composed immediately of the letter Yod, the Hebrew equivalent of the number 
  Ten. The number Ten expresses the relationship that exists on the Tree of Life 
  between the doctrines of the Universal Israel and all of the other nations and 
  religious traditions of the earth. Israel is a nation being taken out of and 
  removed from the midst of all the other nations of the earth--the Zionist nation 
  among them. (Revelation 5:9). The Number Ten (expressing Fulness) encompasses 
  and includes all of the nations of the earth, from the East as far as the West, 
  with the Universal Israel emerging out of them. The name is completed with the 
  suffix &quot;el&quot; (Aleph and Lamed), an ancient manifestation of the Divine 
  Name, one which is also expressed in the dimensions of this same Tree of Life.

    It was the reappearance, in the midst of medieval Judaism, of a frankly mythical 
    statement, presented, moreover, without the slightest apology for its boldness, 
    as though it were the most natural thing in the world...(The following passage 
    from the Bahir is an illustration):</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">It is I who planted this &quot;Tree,&quot; that all the 
    world may delight in it, and with it I have spanned the All and called it 
    All; for on it depends the All, and from it emanates the All, all things need 
    it, and look upon it, and yearn for it, and from it all souls go forth. I 
    was alone when I made it, and no angel can raise himself over it and say: 
    I was there before thee; for when I spanned my earth, when I planted and rooted 
    this Tree and caused them to take delight in each other and (myself) delighted 
    in them--who could have been with me to whom I might have confided this secret?</font></i></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This Tree of God, which is the 
    Tree of the world but at the same time the Tree of souls, is spoken of in 
    other fragments of the 'Bahir.' In some passages, however, it is not represented 
    as something planted by God, but as the mythical structure of God's creative 
    powers:</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And what is this Tree of which you have spoken? He said 
    to him: All powers of God are (disposed) in layers and they are like a Tree: 
    just as the Tree produces its fruit through WATER, so God through WATER increases 
    the power of the Tree. And what is God's WATER? It is Hokhmah (WISDOM), and 
    that (i.e., the fruit of the Tree) is the Soul of the righteous men who fly 
    from the source of the Great Channel, and it rises up and clings to the Tree. 
    And by virtue of what does it flower? By virtue of ISRAEL: when they (the 
    children of Israel) are good and righteous, the SHEKINAH dwells among them,

  will not only unfold, but will mandate themselves in the final events of our

    before the negotiations, and they do not hide it now, except from those who 
    cannot see.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Israel knew it was a mockery to

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE SEDRA OF THE WEEK</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Parashat Nitzavim-Vayelech&quot;...When 
  Chutzpa Rears Its Ugly Head</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Talmud (see Sotah 49b 
    and Rashi) states that among the many ominous manifestations that will be 
    seen in the days just prior to the coming of Moshiac, will be <i>chutzpa yasga</i>, 
    meaning that chutzpa will attain unprecedented heights (or depths). By that 
    indication of the imminent arrival of Moshiac, he should be just at the outskirts 
    of our cities. For chutzpa in general society, as well as in the Jewish community, 
    is rearing its ugly head. The Torah in this Sedra, without using the specific 
    word &quot;chutzpa,&quot; speaks of it in the following words: <i>Lest there 
    should be among you a man or woman, a family or tribe whose heart turns away 
    this day from the L-rd our G-d to go and serve the gods of these nations...and 
    who will bless himself in his heart saying 'I shall have peace though I walk 
    as my heart sees fit...G-d will not be willing to pardon him. </i>(Deut.29:17-19). 
    Rashi explains that the chutpzadik person brags that nothing will happen to 
    him (or them) for following the inclinations of his heart. The chutzpa element 
    here is the brazen arrogance of publicly proclaiming <i>Shalom Yiye Li </i>(nothing 
    will happen to me). </font>(Compare Micah 3:10-12).</p>
  <p>(The Rabbi goes on to say):<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> These 
    days we see an alarming rise of chutzpa on yet another level. In addition 
    to people's certainty of immunity from the grim consequences of their actions 
    detailed in this <i>Sedra</i> (in the balance of chapter 29), there is an 
    insistence that their behavior must be accepted by those who do not wish to 
    'serve the false gods,' or follow fly-by-night fads, and public posturing 
    of certain unacceptable orientations...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also this brand of chutzpa 
    that enables the spiritual leaders of the non-Orthodox movements here and 
    in Israel to demand recognition as rabbis. One would think that once these 
    leaders cast off the <i>Ol Malchus Shoymayim</i> (the authority of the kingdom 
    of Heaven), by not submitting to the binding character of the Oral and Written 
    Law, thus releasing themselves from the discipline of the <i>Halacha</i>, 
    they would be satisfied. But that gain is not enough. They also want the Orthodox 
    Rabbinate to grant them <i>Halachic</i> legitimacy and authority. They want 
    it both ways. Freedom from the Torah and acceptance by the Torah community. 
    This is not possible. In these days of <i>Chesbon Hanefesh</i> (self-examination) 
    we turn to the non-Orthodox spiritual leaders and say to them: THIS IS NO 
    TIME FOR CHUTZPAH. MAKE A CHOICE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. As the Torah says 
    in this sedra: <a href="../UsedImages/chooselife.gif">CHOOSE LIFE</a> SO THAT 
    YOU AND YOUR DESCENDANTS MAY LIVE. (Deut.30:19).&quot; </font>Rabbi David

  FLUNKS NEW ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTS</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Gustav Niebuhr</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bible's account of King David 
    is so well known that even people who rarely crack the Good Book probably 
    have an idea of his greatness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David, Scripture says, was such 
    a superb military leader that he not only captured Jerusalem but also went 
    on to make it the seat of an empire, uniting the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. 
    Thus began a glorious era, later amplified by his son King Solomon, whose 
    influence extended from the borders of Egypt to the Euphrates River. Afterward, 
    decline set in. Yet what if the Bible's account doesn't fit the evidence on 
    the ground? What if David's Jerusalem was really a rural backwater--and the 
    greatness of Israel and Judah lay far in the future?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lately such assertions are coming 
    from some authorities on Israel's archaeology, who speak from the perspective 
    of recent finds from excavations into the ancient past. &quot;The way I understand 
    the finds, there is no evidence whatsoever for a great united monarchy which 
    ruled from Jerusalem over large territories,&quot; said Israel Finkelstein, 
    the director of the Institute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University. &quot;King 
    David's Jerusalem,&quot; he added, &quot;was no more than a poor village at 
    the time.&quot;...His reports from Megiddo that some structures attributed 
    to Solomon were actually built after his reign have touched off a fierce debate 
    in Israel.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within a larger context, what he 
    says reflects a striking shift now under way in how a number of archaeologists 
    understand Israel's past. Their interpretations challenge some of the Bible's 
    best known stories, like Joshua's conquest of Canaan. Other finds have turned 
    up new information that supplements Scripture, like what happened to Jerusalem 
    after it was captured by the Babylonians 2,600 years ago. </font>(That city 
    in the Middle East was never captured by the Babylonians [the Scythians]. 
    Please see chapter 11)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I think it is time to put 
    archaeology in the front line,&quot; said Mr. Finkelstein, the co-author with 
    Neil Asher Silberman of &quot;The Bible Unearthed,&quot; to be published in 
    January by the Free Press...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many archaeologists, both before 
    and after the founding of the modern state of Israel, shared a similar approach 
    in the field, seeking direct evidence for biblical stories. This outlook was 
    shaped by either their religious convictions or their nationalist views, said 
    Amy Dockser Marcus...The problem, she said, is that &quot;you can't help but 
    go in and look at material and interpret material in a certain way.&quot; 
    And that, she added, &quot;led to certain mistakes.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In her book, (&quot;The View From 
    Nebo&quot;), Ms. Marcus...notes that Mr. Yadin believed he had unearthed evidence 
    in the ruins of a place called Hazor that corroborated the biblical account 
    of how that Canaanite city had been destroyed. The Bible says that Hazor fell 
    to invading Israelites led by Joshua. But these days, she said, an increasing 
    number of archaeologists have come to doubt that Joshua's campaign ever took 
    place. Instead, they theorize, that the ancient Israelites emerged gradually 
    and peacefully from among the region's general population--a demographic evolution, 
    not a military invasion.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. Finkelstein makes the same 
    argument: &quot;Archaeology has shown that early Israel indeed emerged from 
    the local population of late Bronze Canaan.&quot; </font>(Which is not exactly 
    correct either)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. In addition, he 
    said, archaeology has turned up no physical remains to support the Bible's 
    story of the Exodus: &quot;There is no evidence for the wanderings of the 
    Israelites in the Sinai desert.&quot; </font>(Which is absolutely correct)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Asked how such conclusions have 
    been received in Israel, Mr. Finkelstein replied that they had produced a 
    &quot;quite strong and negative&quot; reaction. But the anger, he said, was 
    not coming from strictly Orthodox Jews (&quot;who simply ignore us,&quot; 
    he said) but from more secular Jews who prize the biblical stories for their 
    symbolic value to modern Israel. &quot;I think that the younger generation--at 
    least on the liberal side--will be more open and willing to listen,&quot; 
    he said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still considerable disagreement 
    exists among archaeologists on how to interpret many recent finds. And the 
    new theories about ancient Israel are emerging against the backdrop of a raging 
    dispute over so-called biblical &quot;minimalists,&quot; scholars who argue 
    that biblical accounts of early Israel, including the stories of David and 
    Solomon, have little if any basis in history.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This debate was recently fought 
    out in a lively issue of the Biblical Archaeological Review...in which one 
    of the minimalists, the British scholar Phillip Davies, wrote that biblical 
    accounts of early Israel were purely theological, not historical. </font>The

  when she appeared in that land in the 4th century with Bible in hand and a retinue

  </i>must be that place.&quot; And millions have been making pilgrimages to those 
  places ever since. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Biblical literalists immerse themselves in their own studies, 
  in their own rituals, their own interpretations and their own observances. They 
  imagine that their own religion, or sect (or their own intellectual and &quot;scholarly&quot; 
  points of view), to be the ultimate focus of all others--the one to which all 
  others must ultimately return. (And in a collective sense this is true, because 
  we must all eventually arrive at the meaning of each other's traditions, at 
  the core of each other's understandings, in order to arrive at the deep and 
  central meanings of our own). Those Jews and Christians, and Muslims, however, 
  who are caught up in this delusion, that their's is the ultimate expression 
  of God's truth, become as the saying goes (and if we can see it in the Oracle), 
  as those who spend their entire lives hopping around on one foot, with one eye 
  closed, continually throwing themselves and everyone around them off balance. 
  Such is the present state of the entire Judaeo-Christian-Islamic world. It is 
  completely out of balance--out of alignment with Divine Reality. The rest of 
  the world as a result has rejected each of them, and their message (just as 
  they reject each other). And while each imagine themselves to be the apple of 
  God's Eye, each is also in need of the same great deliverance that they believe 
  the others are in need of. Which means, of course, even if they will not acknowledge 
  it, that each of them is waiting on the same manifestation of the sons and daughters 
  of God in our time. (Romans 8:17-36). How and when will these appear? They shall 
  appear in the light of the Lord of Glory, the Lord of History, as God rises 
  up in the collective events of our time, now to judge the two great Zionist 
  nations, America and Israel. (Revelation 19:11-16). Where will they appear? 
  In the darkest place of all, America. Every religious tradition has its roots 
  in the Tree of Life and must trace its origins to the same beginning; and where 
  the beginning was there will be the end be manifest. And where the end is, there 
  will be the new beginning. </font><font size="+1"><a href="SideLinks/TheSeventhMonth.htm">Simchat

<p><font size="+1">God placed Adam in the garden of Eden. We do not contend over 
  the racial characteristics of Adam as some do, for the higher Garden encompass 
  the entire earth, all of its peoples and all of their beliefs. The religion 
  of Israel comprises the sum and comprehends the whole. The garden's lower dimensions, 
  however, to which we have been brought again, and from which the Hebrew mind 
  must ultimately be raised again, are discovered here in the Eastern part of 
  the land we now call the United States of America. <i>Eastward in Eden</i>. 
  Many have already made the Eden-Atlantis connection; others have placed the 
  fabled Atlantis beneath the waves of the sea. We have brought the Genesis account 
  of that age back up onto dry land, onto the mainland of the North American continent 
  (please read the Reader's Digest<i> </i>edition of <i>Mysteries of The Ancient 
  Americas</i> for a basic but comprehensive primer on this subject); and from 
  here we have traced the effects of these ancient teachings outwards across the 
  entire Atlantean world of that time. (Please see chapters 2 and 4).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Ignatius Donnely, of the literally-submersed-continent school 
  of thought, nevertheless comes close enough to our own point of view, so we 
  will quote from him. (All of it in our continued interest of discovering in 
  what manner Ephraim has gone backwards, and from where):</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We have understood this convulsion of nature to be, not a geological 
  or meteorological eruption (beyond the intensity of natural events we are witnessing 
  with horrifying frequency again), thus not a literal flood large enough to cover 
  a whole civilization. The legend of Atlantis has to do, instead, with an overflowing 
  of human events, and to be more specific, of human warfare, as it is also written:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">Matthew 24:37-51.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The central core of these mysteries, though the mysteries themselves 
  were carried into all these other lands as Donnely describes, were taken to 
  ancient Britain where they formed the foundation and the driving ideas, the 
  soul as it is, behind what would come in time to be recognized as Indo-European 
  culture (and thus subsequently the Hebrew mysteries). Recall, however, the Ark 
  had both men and beasts aboard, both clean and unclean spirits. The mysteries 
  were being attended by the activities and counteractivities of both: those of 
  the spiritual sort like Abel (or Seth), and those of the natural sort who were 
  characterized by the spirit of Cain. Those who were like Cain, who heard the 
  teachings of Adam, but in whose minds the meanings could not take root, continued 
  to follow the ways of mortal combat--war as politics. These sons of Adam were 
  counted among the brute warriors of those times, as they still are today--regardless 
  of whether they are Hindu, Jew, Christian or Muslim. These are all the sons 
  of <i>Hagar</i>. (Galatians 4:19-31). Those, however, who were like Abel in 
  those times were like every true pacifist of our times. So we must recognize 
  and distinguish the one spirit from the other as we pour over the ancient accounts, 
  and as we search them for the meanings of our own times. </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, 
    when He separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according 
    to the number of the children of Israel...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 
    32:8). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">From Britain the adepts in these spiritual sciences passed 
  over into Europe. Sensing its presence, awed by its presence, they passed over 
  onto the realm of the Great Dragon, where they sensed by mystic intuition lay 
  hidden the very center of the World Mystery--the Navel of the Earth itself. 
  There was no doubt an ancient oracle there, a Sibyl dedicated to the worship 
  of the Divine Mother. The prophets said of this place situated there at the 
  Navel of the earth: <i>Thy father was an Amorite</i> (from the West) <i>and 
  thy Mother a Hittite </i>(of the East), (Ezekiel 16:3). These adepts, having 
  come up out of the wars that were overflowing the maritime regions (on their 
  eventual way to India and Egypt and other such places), naturally made offerings 
  to the Divine Mother (for it was She, Wisdom, who led them there). As they arrived, 
  however, they were able to infuse the old cultus with a sense of the new--with 
  their developing sense of the universal dimensions of the World Tree. Their 
  sense of &quot;threeness&quot; took its place alongside of the idea of &quot;oneness,&quot; 
  and even &quot;twoness,&quot; and even &quot;manyness.&quot; It was a beginning 
  of sorts of the art of philosophical speculation (the beginning of Kabbalah), 
  the kind of thought process that grows out of the study of universal structures 
  and the science/theology of mathematics and numbers. The ancient stories tell 
  us that they actually drove out, as it were, the old order of things, represented 
  by Chronus (the old concept of Time), who continually--and without reason it 
  must have seemed--devoured everything and everyone that issued forth from him. 
  There seemed to be no structure or meaning to life, or to the process of history. 
  These adepts brought the beginnings of those meanings with them. These meanings 
  would unfold in the great circular pattern of history (from Genesis to Revelation). 
  Old Chronus, we have discovered, thus fled to Eden, to remain there (or rather 
  here) until the mystery of Time itself--the great Circle of Genesis--could be 
  completed and revealed again at the end of the age. (see Isaiah 4:21-24).</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These men were covered up 
    in death, but Zeus the son of Kronos gave the others life and homes apart 
    from mortals, at Earth's edge. And there they live a carefree life, beside

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Three times a year the blooming 
    fertile earth bears honeyed fruits for them, the happy ones. And Kronos is

    Days 165-180<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">These adepts then apportioned the world according to the dimensions 
  of the Oracle, into thirds: the Heavens above, the Earth below, and the Waters, 
  or the Sea between them--the East above, the West below, and the continent and 
  the tribes (the nations) of Europe where the Great Dragon lay in between. Thus 
  we read:</font></p>

    descendants of him who had been cursed after the flood, going beyond their

    violently took the country from which they expelled them...</font>Recognitions 
    of Clement ch.xxxi<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.<font size="+1">

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We must realize that those peoples who the Hebrew scribes were 
  calling Canaanites, or even Shemites, did not call themselves by these names, 
  and perhaps for the most part knew nothing of them. The names are purely scriptural. 
  Those tribes and peoples called themselves by other names (Vedic names, Indo-European 
  names, proto-Celtic names). In time those who were called Shemites by the Hebrew 
  scribes (along with the central doctrines of the Shemites) were driven out of 
  Central Europe into the East. And those who were called the Canaanites, who 
  had their assignment in the West, took their place in the center of things. 
  With the way open to the Eastern regions the (Indo-European) &quot;Canaanites&quot; 
  also came down and inhabited those regions in the East and Middle East that 
  we presently associate with the land of Canaan, as it is written: <i>And afterward 
  were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. </i>(Genesis 10:18). They 
  also came into Egypt and infused themselves (politically and militarily), along 
  with the structure of their religious and historical beliefs, into the already-existing 
  Nubian culture. But the tribes, or the teachings of Shem (Semitism), as well 
  as the names, <i>Ham</i> and <i>Canaan</i>, <i>Mizraim</i> and <i>Cush</i> (which 
  have their origins in the West), were now associated with the East and we imagine 
  them to have originated there...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the Western mysteries, and the ideas and place-names associated 
  with them, were being carried into the East, into Mesopotamia as far as India 
  and beyond, giving rise to Vedic culture. (One can procure a work entitled <i>Beginnings 
  of Life, Culture, and History</i>, edited by S. D. Kulkarni, and published by 
  BHISHMA, Thane, India, 1988, from the local Hindu Society, and discover the 
  ancient connections that exist between the Vedic people--the Seven Rivers and 
  the mysterious lands watered by the Sarasvati, and a hidden place named &quot;Sapta&quot;--and 
  that place hidden in the center of Europe named Judaesaptan)...</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>This is the City of David...Isaiah 27 to 29.</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">And, as we have been discovering, these mysteries also found 
  their way down to Egypt and in those ancient times were built into the structure 
  of the pyramids, and inscribed in hieroglyph in almost every temple wall. Later 
  we are told that Abram and Sarai--or rather those adepts in the Vedic sciences 
  who returned Westward again in the spirit of Brahma and Sarasvati, giving birth 
  to a whole set of Hebrew archetypes in their own spiritual wanderings--came 
  into Egypt also on their way back to the land of Canaan. Like Moses</font><font size="+1">

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Holy Land of those who had 
    gone out from the body, watered by the Celestial Nile, the River of Heaven, 
    of which the earthly river was a symbol and parallel, was divided into three 
    regions, or states:the Territory of Initiation; the Territory of Illumination; 
    and the Place of Union with the Unseen Father.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the religion of Egypt, 
    the deepest and most fascinating mystery of antiquity, the visible creation, 
    was conceived as the counterpart of the unseen world. And the substance consisted 
    not of a mere vague belief in the life beyond the grave, but in tracing out 
    the Path whereby the Just, when the portal of the tomb is lifted up, passes 
    through the successive stages of Initiation, of Illumination, and of Perfection, 
    necessary to fit that soul for an endless union with the Light, the Great

    Crown of Illumination, &quot;fashioned after the form of the Zodiacal light,

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Later on the Hebrew archetype Jacob and his family (who ultimately 
  symbolize the entire family of humankind), would also have to sojourn in the 
  land of Egypt before returning to the promised state of mind (which was associated 
  by then with a land of Canaan). We also see now how that place called Egypt 
  in the East came to be associated with that realm which originally lay beyond 
  the sea in the West, (the original land of Ham)? This was the work of those 
  spiritual adepts who knew the higher universal dimensions of Egypt and how Israel's 
  sojourn and captivity in the East would become a mirror image of the Nation's 
  eventual captivity in the West at the end of the age. (Genesis 15:13-16). They 
  also understood how the office of the Egyptian Pharaoh would reflect in time, 
  the greatest of all the World Rulers (the office of the American Presidency), 
  who would rise up in the West at the end of days. One side of the World Mystery 
  was made to be a reflection of the other. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">God too was functioning in history according to the dictates 
  of the Oracle, and was in league with the adepts in the sacred mysteries; and 
  in the fulness of those times sent </font><font size="+1"><a href="../UsedImages/ChristMystery.gif">Aaron 
  and Moses</a> (the first of many noted pairs in Israel) to deliver the mind 
  of Israel from its initial state of bondage. The children of Israel (whoever 
  they were in those times), had become slaves, not simply to their Egyptian overlords 
  as we are told, but to their own fallen sense of reality. They had become pragmatists 
  and &quot;realists&quot; (facts on the ground), and had abandoned every sense 
  of the transcendent nature of things. They had fallen into a state of mind that 
  was wholly conditioned by the material and intellectual, and eventually the 
  national status-quo, which was itself attended by much injustice, oppression, 
  and war. Nor could they, by reason of this bondage, reason the nature of God's 
  Presence or the meaning of God's intentions in all of these things. They imagined 
  in their complacency, as we do today, that, despite their own difficulties life 
  in Egypt was better than life &quot;out there&quot; in the wilderness. That 
  the deliverance from those affairs was to be a reflection of the Great Deliverance 
  that shall take place in our time--from the purely American state of mind into 
  which we have fallen--is revealed in the dimensions of the pilgrim and counting 
  festivals instituted by the Spirit through Moses--the Seven days of Passover, 
  the Counting of Jubilees, and the final Day of Atonement--all of which were 
  instituted to carry the mind of Israel out of those times, across the pages 
  of history, to our own times here in the West...</font></p>

    of a single human life between the generations, and an entire people's history

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Moses now begins to shepherd 
    the flocks of Jethro...The flocks which represent the thoughts and commands 
    of the bad shepherd, have to be put in order by Moses, led into justice. His 
    relation to Jethro is indeed like Jacob's to Laban, but is much better a type 
    of the way in which the Good Shepherd will come and shepherd the flock. The 
    allegory is an extended one of the divine power of salvation, and the divine 
    care God exercises for those who come to him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The experience at the Burning bush 
    is variously explained. In one passage Moses seems to be attempting to solve 
    the principle of cosmic causation when he approaches the Burning bush with 
    his shoes on. He is warned off the Holy ground of causation by God who has 
    reserved knowledge of this for divine natures...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With his vision of God thus clarified, 
    and with the practical assistance of Aaron, Moses now goes to Egypt to begin 
    his great work. He returns to Pharaoh to struggle with him and ultimately 
    destroy him. Pharaoh represents all that is bad (or subtle) in human nature, 
    a lover of pleasure (or power, a man who is naturally self-possessed)...and 
    hence, with Egypt his country, represents the body in its worst form. </font>(See 
    Ezekiel 31)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Captive in this country is the 
    mind 'fond of seeing,' Israel, which at this stage is rather the mind 'capable 
    of seeing.' This mind must be led out of Egypt if it is to get the vision, 
    and it is Moses who, with Aaron, has the power to do this for man's higher 
    nature. The salvation he brings the Israelites is one 'where the helping principle 
    of its own accord comes wholly from the outside to shield us after our own 
    faculties have been quite destroyed.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the people are thus united in 
    one great collective act of migration they are made one; from being a multitude, 
    or a tribe, or a people, they become an 'ecclesia,' a church, united not so 
    much in body as in mind, intent, and spirit. The Passover is held at evening 
    because of the significance of evening, the time of the fading of the material 
    light at the coming of the immaterial illumination. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In another passage Pharaoh is king 
    of the lower bodily mind in revolt against God. Not only is the mind engrossed

    self-satisfaction that comes with a sense of religious self-certainty, and 
    self-righteousness, as well)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, but 
    it takes the higher mind, with its possibilities of vision, and enslaves it. 
    The higher mind groans heavily at this subjection and cries to God the only 
    Saviour. In answer God commands, 'Send forth the people that they may serve 
    me.' The type of service to which he calls them is not a menial one; it consists 
    of going up to the aetherial heights with their reasonings, setting them before

<p><font size="+1">To enact the episode in a microcosmic way, as an image of the 
  Greater Journey, Moses (whoever Moses was), led the children of Israel a literal 
  three day's journey to that barren place in Palestine, where he built that city 
  we now call Jerusalem. He built it of stone (just as it is said that the Written 
  Law was carved in tables of stone), as an image-below of that living City Above, 
  which God would build later in the heights of the Oracle, just as it is written: 
  <i>For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. </i>(Hebrews 
  13:14).<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></font><font size="+1">Of 
  course literal tradition holds that Moses never crossed the Jordan River but 
  had to stand on the other side while Israel went over to conquer the promised 
  land. And this because he did not only &quot;once&quot; but &quot;twice&quot; 
  struck the <i>Rock</i>. (Numbers 20:1-12; Ex.17:1-7; Deuteronomy 34). Anyone, 
  however, who is developing an epic sense of the meaning of the oracles can also 
  sense the meaning of these passages. They mean that while the spirit of Moses 
  has guided Israel across two epoch periods, all the way to the farthest ends 
  of the earth, the Written Law by itself, and the Literal Tradition alone, cannot 
  pass over, nor can it of itself bring forth <i>Water from the Rock</i>. Only 
  the Spirit can perform such a miracle, and only in the Higher meaning of the 
  Law can the people pass over: and only when it is revealed can it deliver the 
  Nation. So Moses, explaining the meaning of the text to the children of Israel, 
  pointed them ahead to the time when Israel would ascend into the Promise again 
  in the Mystery of Christ, as it is written: <i>And Joshua the son of Nun was 
  full of the spirit of Wisdom; for Moses laid his hands upon him: and the children 
  of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses. </i>(Duet.34:9). 
  Thus Paul says: <i>And that Rock that followed them was Christ...</i>(1 Cor.10:4).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The tradition also assumes that that river Jordan over there 
  is the Jordan of the Scriptures (and not simply some lower image of it as well), 
  and, of course, that Palestine itself is both the land of Canaan and the land 
  of Promise into which Israel crossed...</font></p>

    away from there to Judaea, since he was displeased with the state of affairs

    For he said and taught that the Egyptians were mistaken in representing the 
    Divine Being by the images of beast and cattle...and that the Greeks were 
    equally wrong in modeling gods in human form; for according to him God is 
    this one thing alone which encompasses land and sea--the things which we call 
    heaven, or universe, or the nature of all that exists...Nay, people should 
    leave off all image carving, and, setting apart a sacred precinct and a worthy 
    sanctuary should worship God without an image; and people who have good dreams 
    should sleep in the sanctuary, not only themselves on their own behalf, but 
    also others for the rest of the people; and those who live self-restrained 
    lives should always expect some blessing or gift, or sign from God, but no 
    others should expect them.</font></p>

    which anyone would make a serious fight; for it is rocky, and although it 
    itself is well supplied with water, its surrounding territory is barren and 
    waterless...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At that time Moses, INSTEAD OF 
    USING ARMS, put forward as defense his sacrifices and his Divine Being, being

    them either with expenses or with divine obsessions or with other absurd troubles...His 
    successors for some time abided in the same course, acting righteously and 
    being truly pious toward God; but afterward, in the first place superstitious 
    men were appointed to the priesthood, and then tyrannical people; and from 
    superstition arose abstinence of flesh, from which it is their present custom, 
    and circumcisions and excisions. And from tyrannies arose <a href="../UsedImages/Why_.gif">bands 
    of robbers</a>; and some revolted and harassed the country, both their own

  and of the great paradox that attended this mysterious Presence in the world: 
  the realization that the God of War reveals Himself to none but children of 
  perfect peace, which is why neither America or the Israelis, nor Islam, can 
  understand the nature of the judgments that are falling upon them. (Please see 
  the chapter on the Allegory of Holy Warfare). The whole of it was explained

  AND COMING WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Louis Rene Beres</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The term &quot;correlation of forces&quot; 
    is a useful concept of military strategy. Widely used by the former Soviet 
    Union, it is applied as a measure of armed forces, from the subunit level 
    to major formations. Additionally it has been used to compare resources and 
    capabilities on both the levels of military strategy and of so-called &quot;grand 
    strategy.&quot; This meaning is closely related to the concept of &quot;force 
    ratios&quot; used in the West.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, with the winds of war blowing 
    again in the Middle East, Israel must undertake productive assessments of 
    enemy states with particular reference to &quot;correlation of forces.&quot; 
    Here it must seek more than an &quot;objective&quot; yardstick for measurement 
    of opposing forces...This is especially the case in matters of grand strategy, 
    where opposing forces are endowed with weapons of mass destruction...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, it must take full account 
    of enemy leaders' intentions as well as capabilities. Such an accounting is 
    inherently more subjective than assessments of personal, weapons and basic 
    logistic data. Such an accounting must be subtle and nuanced, relying less 
    on scientific modeling than upon carefully informed profiles...It will be 
    important to put themselves into the shoes of each enemy leader, (and if the 
    enemy is the God of War Himself?), determining what Israel looks like to them....</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Correlation of forces will essentially 
    determine the outcome of the coming catastrophic war. It is time for Israel 
    to go well beyond the usual numerical assessments to &quot;softer&quot; considerations, 
    and to focus especially upon the cumulative importance of unconventional weapons 
    and strategies in the region. The </font>Jewish Press, Feb.9, 2001<b>.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This is the kind of demonic language that presently defines 
  the relationship, not only of the Israeli people to their own government, and 
  to the surrounding nations, but to God. And what difference can it make if Israel 
  is capable of destroying the entire Arab world, if the Jewish people and the 
  Israeli state are destroyed in the same process? Wake up!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Forty years of wandering in the wilderness is another historical 
  allegory. It makes use of the three periods of history that have transpired 
  from the time of Adam to our time: Forty jubilees of years (40 X 49 years) from 
  Adam unto Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Forty jubilees of years from that time 
  to the time of Christ. And finally Forty jubilees of years from the time of 
  Christ to our time, for a total of 120 jubilees (the age of Moses), as 120 X 
  49 = 5,880 years. So the number Forty, whether it be jubilees, years, or days, 
  symbolizes a time of initiation, a time of trial and of coming to spiritual 
  perfection--and particularly does it apply to the time of initiation that has 
  transpired from the time of Christ to our own time--when Israel ascended <a href="SideLinks/GreekMyths.htm">up 
  into Europe</a> again, under the name of Joshua again.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The academic world is already complete with books and articles 
  dedicated to the connections that exist between ancient Israel and the classical 
  world, and between Israel and the Druids of old, many of which we have already 
  cited in the preceding chapters. One must want to discover them however. One 
  must want to open their eyes, and must hunger for reason and meaning to what 
  seems to be a religious world so divided and completely out of order, so ignorant 
  of itself, and so devoid of remedy in our time. To do so one must be able to 
  break from one's own tradition, long enough to step back, to look at the whole 
  from a completely detached point of view. Stripped of all forms of certainty 
  one is then free to wonder what God's purpose in all this confusion could be, 
  expecting, that is, to also receive an answer. One must not only believe that 
  God is, but one must also learn to ask the right questions of God. If not, then 
  God (the mystic Voice of Nature) is not obliged in any spiritual, or even in 
  any practical sense of the term to provide the right answers. One must approach, 
  however, with a sound mind and in a spirit of true love. If one does not approach 
  God in this way--not just with a love for God alone (for what can this mean?), 
  but for all that God is, and for all that God has created, indeed, for the very 
  process of creation itself--it is literally impossible to shed the right tears, 
  or to hunger for the right things, thus to frame the right questions and to 
  receive the right answers. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Love, of course, is the key. Love for God and love for others 
  is found among the practitioners of every other religious tradition on earth. 
  Which means that Christianity and Judaism are not the only true religions, and 
  most often seem the very furthest from it, for Love itself is the true religion, 
  <i>For God is Love. </i>And<i> Love is the fulfilling of the law</i>. It is 
  found among the non-religious as well. It is found in great cities and in seemingly 
  barren places, and everywhere in between. One finds it among the poor, and among 
  the poor-in-spirit, and sometimes among the not-so-poor. Though love seems powerless 
  in the world today (and we mean real love, that kind which is detached from 
  personal ambition), it can be found everywhere, serving others and being served. 
  The wealthy and the powerful steal from it, using the word itself as a guise 
  to mask their worldly intentions. They steal the words that define it; they 
  appear among those who are practicing it, hoping to exalt themselves among them, 
  but to fulfill its absolute requirements--repentence, humility, surrender, self 
  denial, vulnerability, anonymity--they would not dare. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As one learns that just as Love is not limited to any single 
  place, or any single group in the world, so neither is Truth, for Love and Truth 
  are bound up intricately to one another, and both are in a sense one single, 
  extended aspect of the same Divine Reality. In the pursuit of them one is drawn 
  out of one's own tradition to the traditions and writings of all others, and 
  along the way to an understanding of the historical forces that are bringing 
  all such others, as well as ourselves, to this present and common state of mind. 
  One discovers at last that Truth (which includes the realities of both light 
  and darkness, good and evil, both of which flow from the same Cosmic Source) 
  transcends all individuals, and all nations, and all their individual traditions, 
  but rather encompasses them and includes them. Truth embraces all. (The Universal 
  Israel is God's expression of that embrace). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If led by the spirit of Truth, to open all the right books, 
  to walk through all the right doors, and to listen to all the right voices, 
  one will find it. And if so, one is invariably led by these studies and these 
  voices, and this quest, to the Oracle, and to all of the reasonings that reveal 
  themselves, world upon world, level upon level, word upon word, precept upon 
  precept, from the center of the Oracle. With each wave of understanding a segment 
  of the world puzzle fits into place. (Keep the pieces). As each piece fits into 
  place, in one's own thoughts that is, the Whole begins to be recreated there. 
  One's mind begins to align itself with the Whole--with the structure of Reality, 
  with the Mind of God... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And then Compassion sets in--compassion for God as well as 
  for men. One naturally, is disturbed by the judgments sweeping the world, but 
  not for the same reasons, or with the same failure of reason as others, because 
  one senses the higher meaning of it now. It is disturbing, but there is a higher 
  reason. One struggles with God about it all, but ultimately understands that 
  such judgments are emanating into the world--from the Mind of God itself, indeed 
  from the depths of Divine consciousness itself--in the very interest of Love 
  itself. Not only in the interest of actually creating Love, but in the ultimate 
  interest of freeing Love from its captivity in the lower world. <i>How shall 
  we liken this generation... </i>It is all unfolding in the great interest of 
  connecting the heart chakra to the mind, and of opening the two in conjunction 
  with each other. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And while natural self-interest and a timely sense of self-preservation 
  in the face of mortal danger may seem to deliver many from the judgments that 
  are coming (especially upon those who presently seem <a href="../UsedImages/chooselife.gif">intent 
  to go down</a> with the Zionist state as they did at Masada during the judgments 
  of those ancient times), Love will lead those who understand to the words which 
  say again: <i>If two make peace with each other in this one house, they will 
  say to the mountain</i> (this true Holy nation), <i>'Move away,' and it will 
  move away. </i>(Gospel of Thomas 48; Mth.17:20). Such words will have their 
  fullest meaning here in the West, however, for American Zionism is in a much 
  greater state of transgression than Jewish Zionism, because it is being accomplished 
  in the name of Christ--the very one who came into the world to tell us that 
  <i>it is a Terrible thing to fall into the hands of the Living God.</i>.(2 Corinthians 
  5:11; Hebrews 10:31). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If we can understand how love is the key that opens the Door 
  to the higher realities, we can begin to see how the absence of love has led 
  to all the troubles that beset us--in addition to the fact that God has also 
  cast a historic spell over us until the times were full. (Isaiah 28 and 29, 
  KJV). Ancient Israel was entrusted with the oracles of Life and Death, and charged 
  with demonstrating their effects to the world. The covenant was for both good 
  and evil as is being clearly witnessed in these present times. (The covenant 
  with Israel is also a figure of the covenant God will remake with the whole 
  world, once all of the sublime and hidden meanings of the Torah are revealed. 
  One, of course, can not be born into such a covenant [as many in Judaism would 
  have it] or forced into it [as the Roman Church did to millions in its time, 
  and as Islam has, and which it still attempts to do in many of the lands under 
  its dominion], but each must ultimately bring themselves to it as their own 
  free will offering). Israel would have become a very present blessing to humankind 
  if it would have kept the covenant (which it did not, and, of course, could 
  not), and a curse if it did not (which it has become). Israel was also entrusted 
  with the means of excelling in the truth, while being able to hide the truth 
  from the children of Darkness at the same time (which it has accomplished)--allowing 
  the spirit of Darkness to expose itself in the end. </font></p>

  She was referring, not to issues involving the Zionist state directly, but to 
  the almost irreconcilable differences that were evident several years ago between 
  the Black and Hasidic communities in Brooklyn after the death of young Gavin 
  Cato (which, nevertheless, reflects the intractable differences that exist between 
  literalists of every kind, in every land). It has to do with the precept in 
  the Torah which says: <i>Thou shalt not seeth a kid in its mother's milk. </i>(Exodus 
  23:19; 34:26). Those who observe this precept in a purely literal way, refrain 
  in their daily lives from cooking dairy products in the same vessels in which 
  meats are also prepared (for how else could the precept be interpreted once 
  the Mystery of Christ is rejected); and so, in the interest of their own rigid 
  religious observances, such individuals could never accept an invitation to 
  dinner at a home of anyone who seems not to observe or regard this precept, 
  for fear of staining one's own Jewish soul. (Please see Acts, chapter 10). And 
  they would naturally not invite any such people to their own homes in any attempt 
  at reconciliation, for fear of being contaminated by the outside world, seeing 
  how such people are so obviously &quot;gentiles,&quot; and &quot;nonbelievers&quot; 
  anyway. They could not, in their own rigid observances, realize how these others 
  might well be every much a child of Israel as themselves, observing the precept, 
  in a higher way--from the other side of the Oracle. For what the precept really 
  means is that one should not prepare to offer &quot;themselves&quot; (the kid) 
  as <a href="../UsedImages/ThinkingAloud.gif">a living sacrifice</a>, and as 
  an atonement to God, in accordance with the literal statutes of the Torah (the 
  Mother), (see Isaiah 28:9-13), but, rather, must do so according to the true 
  inner, higher and enlightened meanings of the Torah. According to these higher 
  precepts, those on the Left side of the Oracle are called at last to lay down 
  their lives, literally for those on the Right side, as it is also written:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It was these very differences of interpretation that separated 
  the first Christians from their Jewish co-religionists--Essenes from Pharisees--in 
  the first century, just as the revelation of them now will separate the true 
  Israel from the Zionist nations of the world to which it is captive in our own 
  time. But we can trace these differences, and the great confusion that was born 
  of them back to the time of Moses itself...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It began when some of Israel (the figurative two and a-half 
  tribes) remained in the East, forming the religious base for what would later 
  become the Samaritan religion, while the rest of Israel followed the spirit 
  of Joshua up into Europe. (Deut.31:23 to 32:52). And then it was exacerbated 
  when the mind of Israel fell out with itself and was led away from the center 
  of its own mysteries (Judah) back into the East again after the time of D.V.D. 
  and Solomon. There is a remnant of Samaritans in Palestine today whose own histories 
  offer an obscured account of these things, recalling how these schismatics from 
  the North pushed their way out of the Homeric period into the regions of Samaria, 
  and then almost continuously afterwards, until they had fully occupied Jerusalem 
  (that &quot;backwater&quot; city in the East) after the time of the Maccabees. 
  By this time the history of Israel was so confused that no one outside of the 
  school of the Hebrew prophets could remember which way it went, which way it 
  came and which way it was going. Because true religion falls into the realm 
  of philosophy at the intellectual level, philosophy itself is the culprit that 
  removes the mind from its own spiritual center, such as the philosophy of the 
  Enlightenment that led to the formation of the American nation (see Colossians 
  2:8-10), and, as we have described before, the philosophy of Jeroboam which 
  turned the heart of Israel away from the City of David (or rather the Mysteries 
  of D.V.D.) ten centuries before the time of Christ. Like all wayward philosophers 
  he scattered Israel with a form of the truth. (See Romans 2:20). Jeroboam set 
  up the Golden Calves. These were his own misguided and imperfect interpretations 
  of the Hebrew Solar Mysteries. He said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I suppose my countrymen that 
    ye know this, THAT EVERY PLACE HATH GOD IN IT, nor is there one determinate 
    place in which He is. But He everywhere hears and sees those who worship Him, 
    on which account I do not think it right for you to go so long a journey to 
    Jerusalem which is the enemy's city to worship Him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was man who built the temple. 
    I have also made two Golden (Solar) Heifers dedicated to the same God, that 
    those of you who live closest to them may go and worship. I will order for 
    you certain priests, and let them desirous among you to be a priest bring 
    to God a bullock or a ram which they say Aaron the priest brought also.&quot;

    so Israel rebelled against the house of Judah unto this day, and made Jeroboam 
    king...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Kings 12:19,20).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We must not insist that this Jeroboam be any literal person 
  who ever lived at all, but rather a literary embodiment of the whole state of 
  mind that Israel was subject to then. In those days Israel went from &quot;Rehoboam,&quot; 
  which means from &quot;being enlarged,&quot; to &quot;Jeroboam,&quot; which 
  means &quot;to being adversaries and contentious.&quot; (1 Kings 11:28-35; 43).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Because Israel entered Europe under the command of Joshua--as 
  a pre-enactment of the time when it would enter it again in the time of Christ--and 
  because Joshua (in this aspect of the Hebrew mysteries) was from the tribe of 
  Ephraim, the name Ephraim came to symbolize the whole developing schism that 
  would not only split Israel in those ancient times, but which would ultimately 
  give rise to the Zionist heresy of the 20th century:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The &quot;women&quot; that Solomon bowed down to were not females 
  persons, or in any other literal sense &quot;700 wives and 300 concubines,&quot; 
  but rather they describe the lower thought-forms and fallen philosophies of 
  the nations that the mysteries of Israel fell into during the epic reign of 
  Solomon. Having filled the world with itself, the mind of Israel could not help 
  being assimilated downwards into the reasonings of those around it. Just one 
  degree of difference, or separation from the perfect vision of God, and of God's 
  righteousness, constitutes a &quot;strange wife.&quot; For if we recall how 
  the number 1,000 (or the cube of the Mystery, 10 X 10 X 10...Revelation 21:16), 
  represents the state of mind coming to perfection, so 1,000 foreign wives and 
  concubines represent the mind being drawn away from it. Those who maintained 
  the vision were being reduced to a remnant, while the mysteries of Israel themselves 
  wandered or were driven abroad. In time it says:</font></p>

  to be guardians of the mystery (and Keepers of the Written Law), to tell those 
  who might venture downwards to that City made-of-stone below that it was only 
  an image, an architectural oracle if you will, of the City made-without-hands 
  above. The remnant of the two and a-half tribes who remained faithful to these 
  things (even though those who came after them almost clearly forgot the meaning 
  of it all) were told by Moses that they would be delivered from the East in 
  the time of Christ, and that they were to guard the other, written half of the 
  Torah that was entrusted to them until then. All of these things are the underlying

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That God is not a respecter 
    of Jews merely because they are the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
    was to the rabbis a truism. They remind us that every gift which He bestowed 
    upon Israel He also bestowed upon the nations...He is ready lovingly to embrace 
    in His eternal arms all the children of men. His first covenant He made long 
    before the one at Sinai. He made it with Adam and confirmed it with Noah...It 
    was the original Torah, and all that the Lord required at that stage of civilization...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Ye are mine,' God is represented 
    by the rabbis as saying, 'when ye are as holy as I am,' and 'only when ye 
    sanctify My Name will I sanctify it over you.' Or as Rabbi Judah b. Ilia puts 
    it: &quot;Ye are the children of God when ye conduct yourselves in a manner 
    becoming His children.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judaism is not a matter of birth, 
    but of behavior. It is written, says R. Levi, 'and I have separated you from 
    the nations.' not the nations from you: As one selects the good from the bad, 
    God picks His children wherever they appear, like the gardener his flowers...'He 
    is present wherever the righteous are present,' says R. Johannan b. Zakkai.&quot;

<p><font size="+1">The Zionist, and even Jewish failure to regard or understand 
  these universal principles (upon which the whole Torah is based), has resulted, 
  not only in laying the Foundation again of a &quot;Jewish&quot; state <a href="../UsedImages/Palestine_Or.gif">in 
  Palestine</a>, and setting up the Gates again in the 20th century, but in the 
  impossible attempt to fully consummate a <a href="../UsedImages/Why_.gif">nation 
  called Israel</a>, in the midst of a world that sadly looks on, knowing intuitively 
  that the true &quot;Israel&quot; is a much greater and holier thing than that. 
  And among certain Christian Anglo-philes it has also led to the erroneous belief 
  that Britain and America are Ephraim and Manasseh. Those who are led by this 
  belief--the various Anglo-Israel movements, the Mormon Church and all of its 
  American Identity offshoots, and Southern Baptists to a different extent, and 
  the American Klan that spawned from them after the Civil War--are then driven 
  by many other misinterpretations of the Law to regard America, not merely as 
  a place where Zion is presently sojourning but where Zion shall be established 
  for all time. These believe that the United States was founded upon the principles 
  of the Law and the Prophets (instead of in violation of them), that Zion is 
  a purely Christian (and for some a purely white) phenomenon, and that in time 
  some champion (perhaps some extraordinary leader or President like Ronald Reagan, 
  or as George W. Bush Jr. is presently aspiring) would arise to lead everyone 
  back to these founding principles. Or in the case of Mormonism, that God will 
  eventually lead us all back to the principles of American Zionism as they are 
  expounded by the prophets of the Mormon Church. Such ideas lead either into 
  full-blown participation with the American political, economic, and military 
  order of things (with a fervent belief in those institutions), or to a state 
  of religious paranoia, and in some to the idea that in the absence of such a 
  champion it is the people's duty to organize, or arm themselves (in accordance 
  with all of the precepts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, 
  which are considered to be sacred documents next to the Bible), and to stand 
  ready to defend the principles of &quot;Zion&quot; whenever they are threatened, 
  with their own lives, and the lives of their sons and daughters if necessary. 
  (Think of the Israeli settlers).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The mainline American church, on the other hand, believes that 
  it is not involved with the irrational theological behavior of such groups, 
  or cults as it calls them, and cannot see how all of that is a direct reflection 
  of their own involvement in the activities of the mainline American religious 
  and body-politic. All of them collectively, in one way or another, seek to impress 
  upon the American state of mind, and its leaders, the statutes of Israel as 
  it perceives them, thus upon the ultimate American leader the obligation of 
  carrying them out...thus further encouraging and empowering him in the mystique 
  of Christ, that is, in the mystique of the office of the President itself, which 
  is antichrist. Never mind that the American nation has been in violation of 
  the most obvious of God's laws since its very founding, as has the State of 
  Israel, but what few can actively see is that the true children of Israel are 
  actually lost and oppressed among these two nations, and that the greatest contribution 
  to the disorder in the world today is World Zionism itself...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Ephraim and Manasseh are not in the literal sense simply two 
  of the tribes of Israel, but, according to the ancient methods of employing 
  types and figures, these two, the offsprings of Joseph, symbolize the entire 
  nation in itself. They embody, apart from the other tribes of Israel, the entire 
  epic in themselves--just as the tribe of Dan also did when Israel first came 
  up into Europe in the time of Joshua. From this eponymous and prophetic viewpoint 
  Ephraim embodies the center of the Mystery, while the two half-tribes of Manasseh 
  represent those who stayed in the East and those who wandered in time toward 
  the West. But &quot;Ephraim went backwards.&quot; (Psalm 78:9-11; Hosea 8:11-13). 
  Ephraim did not follow the course of the heavens, or the path of the Higher 
  Sun as it took its rise out of the East in the time of Christ, to its setting 
  here in the West at the end of the age. Which is why the tribe of Ephraim is 
  not listed among the tribes of Israel that have come out of the great tribulations 
  of our time in Revelation, chapter 7.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When the State of Israel shot out its branches in 1948 every

  was <i>fruitless</i>, as it is also written: <i>Ephraim is smitten, their root 
  is dried up, THEY SHALL BEAR NO FRUIT. </i>(Hosea 9:16). And then, that the 
  center of Israel could not lie in the East where the Sun rises upon the earth 
  at the time of the Spring equinox, but that it must be situated somewhere in 
  the North where the Sun is at its full strength at the time of the Summer solstice.

<p><font size="+1">A study of the Kabbalah informs us that a complete spiritualization 
  of the Law would occur under the dominion of the Tree of Life. Thus Paul said 
  of those who have governed their lives by a complete application of the Literal 
  Torah: <i>For I testify again to every man that is (literally) circumcised</i>, 
  <i>that he is a debtor to do the whole law. </i>Even if one were sitting in 
  the middle of</font><font size="+1"><a href="SideLinks/TempleArea.htm"> the 
  Temple itself</a> (one built with human hands that is, and with a blueprint 
  formed of normal human logic...Ezekiel 40 to 48), they could not hope to please 
  God, or to fulfill the precepts of the Torah, if they thought for a moment they 
  could do so by continuing in the literal precepts of the law. God would throw 
  such a temple down again--directly on top of those who imagine once again that 
  God could be pleased with the blood of rams and oxen, sheeps, goats, and doves. 
  Especially after all the blood that has already been spilled on the earth over 
  the last two thousand years, and which is still yet to be spilled. Are not these 
  Five Kinds (Leviticus 7:37) a figure of the collective qualities of Christ--not 
  simply of all those who have been consciously laying down their lives as willing 
  sacrifices over the centuries, but in an equal sense, of those millions upon 
  millions in the world whose lives were also required of them beyond their own 
  comprehension, as it is written of the various other powers of the earth: <i>Are 
  they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall 
  be heirs of salvation? </i>(Hebrews 1:5-14). (Hebrews, chapters 9, and 10)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus Paul did not attack the law, his old <i>schoolmaster</i>, 
  but those who could not see into its hidden structure (while professing that 
  they could). <i>For the law is good, </i>he says, <i>if men use it lawfully. 
  </i> Messiah is zealous for the hidden things of the law, for these lead the 
  mind in the pathways of Wisdom and Understanding. The written, or literal precepts 
  of the law were framed around those universal truths that were already being 
  revealed to the world before the time of Moses. The Torah's effects, as we said 
  before, was to preserve these truths from the children of this world, while 
  revealing them to the children of the world-to-come. </font></p>

  <i>Thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land.

  &quot;us.&quot; Every child born into the world, even though they might be born 
  into the most religious, or the most orthodox of families, is born into the 
  Egypt of its own personal existence. And every soul must explore the depths 
  of their very own being before it can ascend to the Covenant in its own right, 
  with its own mind. And many may even find themselves going back down, as it 
  were, to work out some spiritual difficulty or another before they come back

  and lead us home to the Promised land.&quot;</font></p>

  <p align="center"><b>&quot;According to Teitelbaum, Zionism and the establishment 
    of the State of Israel constitutes a violation of the Three oaths which the 
    people of Israel was made to swear (see Ket. 3). This has delayed the coming 
    of the Messiah and complete redemption, and resulted in all the troubles affecting 
    the Jewish people in the 20th century. The Holocaust also was a punishment

<p><font size="+1">The Rebbe, Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, was, according to his followers, 
  &quot;born inspired from the womb.&quot; We have another opportunity here to 
  see into the mysteries of metempsychosis (the transmigration of certain souls 
  from one place in time to another), and into the way in which the ministry and 
  the words of the prophets have been fulfilled in the world in our time. For 
  even though these Jewish opponents of the Zionist movement out of Europe could 
  not see into the hidden structure of spiritual reality--even though the Rebbe 
  and his followers did not know that the true City of David was situated just 
  up river from their own villages in Eastern and Central Europe--they were directed 
  by the Overshadowing and Indwelling Spirit to behave as if they did. The historic 
  effect is the same. And though this Jewish remnant could not fully understand 
  in what way the United States is both the original Chaldea and the Babylon of 
  the prophets, or how their sojourn in this land was a fulfilling of the book 
  of <a href="../UsedImages/Lamentations.gif">the prophet Jeremiah</a>, they were 
  led by the Spirit to behave as if they did. When it was said that the Rebbe 
  was &quot;inspired from the womb,&quot; it was because the prophet Jeremiah 
  of ancient times was also inspired from the womb, and because these times are 
  the fulfillment of those times:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before 
    thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and ordained thee a prophet 
    unto the nations.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then said I, Ah Lord God! behold, I cannot speak; for 
    I am a child.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for 
    thou shalt go to all that I send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou 
    shalt speak...</font></i><font size="+1">(Jeremiah 1:5-7).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We learn from the stories preserved in Martin Buber's <i>Tales 
  of the Hasidim, Later Masters, </i>that the spirit of Jeremiah was already preparing 
  to descend in the time of the Rebbe's great grandparents:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum (d.1839) 
    was always waiting for the coming of the Messiah. Whenever he heard a noise 
    in the street, he asked in trembling tones: 'Has the Messiah come?'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before going to sleep he would 
    lay out his Sabbath clothes near the bed and lean his pilgrim's staff against 
    them. A watchman had orders to wake the rabbi at the first sign he saw.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once someone wanted to sell Rabbi 
    Moshe a fine house right next to the House of Prayer. 'What would I do with 
    it,' he cried. Soon the Messiah shall come and I will go to Jerusalem.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The great zaddikim of his era said 
    that a spark from the soul of Jeremiah had been reborn in him. When anyone 
    wondered at the greatness of his sorrow on the day commemorating the destruction 
    of the Temple, he said, 'Why should you be astonished? I am a man that hath 
    seen affliction, but God will let me see the restoration as well,'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even when he was very old, it never 
    occurred to him that he could possibly die before the coming of Messiah.&quot; 
    </font>The Later Masters, p.191<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We will come to see, as we look deeper into the meaning of 
  the mystery of the <a href="../UsedImages/HebrewKings.gif">Hebrew Kings</a> 
  in the following chapter (so don't be confused yet), that these grandparents 
  were living in times that were spiritually connected to and similar to our own--<i>in 
  the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah</i> (the time of Napoleon)--in which it 
  was said that the Messiah would come. In them we see the spirit of &quot;the 
  Assyrian king&quot; bestriding the continent in all of his arrogance. (Isaiah 
  36 to 38). It is not the American kings yet, who are the ultimate Assyrians, 
  but Napoleon is another in the list of &quot;familiar spirits&quot; (<a href="SideLinks/Nimrod.htm">Nimrod 
  figures</a> beginning with Pharaoh) that lead up to the reign of the American 
  kings in the 20th century. It is he who had to appear <i>for a short time</i>. 
  (Revelation 17:10). The spirit of Jeremiah finally appeared in the person of 
  Yoel Teitelbaum who was born in <i>the days of Josiah, the son of Mannaseh, 
  king of Judah.</i> And the time of Manasseh was the time when the <i>Haskalah 
  </i>began to bear its dark fruit. This is the name given to the whole period 
  of Jewish intellectualism and &quot;enlightenment&quot; that swept through Central 
  and Eastern Europe as far as the Pale of Settlement in Russia (which is Edom) 
  from the eighteenth century up to the years just prior to the 20th century. 
  Out of it grew the Zionist movement to Palestine. There are many excellent and 
  comprehensive studies on the period so we will remain with the Scriptural account 
  of it:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JUDAISM AND ZIONISM</font></p>
<p align="center"><b>A broadcast over Station WBAI-FM, New York (8/27/69)</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I am a member of the Friends 
    of Jerusalem, the American affiliate of the world-wide Jewish Neturei Karta 
    movement...In commenting on Jewish affairs, no topic is more vital today than 
    a clarification of the difference between Judaism and Zionism. All too many 
    Americans are under the impression that these terms are more or less synonymous--that 
    being a Jew means automatically to be a Zionist and that this also implies 
    a certain loyalty to the state of Israel. LET ME THEREFORE STATE RIGHT AT 
    THE BEGINNING THAT JUDAISM AND ZIONISM ARE COMPLETELY INCOMPATABLE AND MUTUALLY 
    EXCLUSIVE. IF YOU ARE A GOOD JEW, YOU CANNOT BE A ZIONIST. IF YOU ARE A ZIONIST, 
    YOU CANNOT BE A GOOD JEW. The reason for this is fairly simple to explain. 
    The Jews are not a race, such as Caucasians or Negroes, as Hitler contended. 
    The Jews are not a nation, like France, Great Britain, the United States, 
    or any other of the nations. And they are not just a religion, like Catholicism, 
    Buddhism, or any of the Protestant denominations. They are, rather, a unique 
    combination, unlike any other. It is true that the Jews are, according to 
    the Bible and their own belief, the Chosen People. But they are not chosen 
    for domination; they are not elected to rule over other people; but THEY ARE 
    CHOSEN FOR ONE PURPOSE ONLY: FOR SERVICE--TO SERVE THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE 
    AND THE FATHER OF US ALL IN A VERY SPECIAL WAY, AND THEREBY TO SERVE ALL MANKIND. 
    </font>(This is a singular truth, one which is clearly understood by both 
    Remnants--those on the Jewish side of the Oracle, and those on the other, 
    Christian, side of the Oracle)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While, according to the Jewish 
    faith, there are only Seven laws that are automatically binding and valid 
    for each human being and while there are Ten Commandments which have been 
    accepted by the civilized world and particularly by the monotheistic faiths 
    as appropriate basic rules for human behavior, the Jews are subject to 613 
    commandments which are in one way or another mentioned in the Five Books of 
    Moses. These laws, which have been codified and spelled out and commented 
    on through the centuries in an immense number of books, constituting the Rabbinic 
    and Halachic literature, are obligatory for everyone born of a Jewish Mother 
    </font>(Please understand here the relationship that exists in the dimensions 
    of the Tree of Life between the Torah and the Mystery of Christ--between &quot;Mary,&quot; 
    the Universal Jewish Mother, and everyone born into the Commonwealth of Israel 
    through the ministrations of these Higher, Oral Traditions...see Matthew 5:17-20)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    or one who has voluntarily accepted the Jewish faith.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The written and oral law, 
    the Torah, is the eternal constitution of the Jewish people, which may be 
    interpreted by those properly qualified, but which can never, in essence, 
    be abrogated, changed, or amended. </font>(Again, see Matthew 5:17-20)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    Through hundreds and thousands of years, Jews everywhere on earth have lived 
    under these rules, sometimes under extreme difficulties, but always willing 
    to live up to this strict code when necessary even to lay down their lives 
    rather than give up their cherished faith,</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Political Zionism started 
    in Europe more than seventy years ago under the impact of anti-semitism. It 
    is a complete departure from this ancient holy tradition. The leading figures 
    in Zionism from the very beginnning have always been men and women who rejected 
    the obligation of these Jewish religious laws, who have never lived by this 
    code and who indeed deny categorically even that the Bible is of divine origin, 
    thereby reducing the five books of Moses, the writings of the prophets, and 
    the other books which together make up the Tenach--the Hebrew Bible--to mere 
    folklore and ancient sages and tales. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The aims of Zionism are: 
    to give the Jewish people a country of their own, to revive Hebrew as its 
    everyday language, to give it a government of its own, a parliament, an army, 
    navy and air force--and all the other paraphernalia and characteristics of 
    a nation like all others. The Jews, who in the words of the Bible are to be 
    a kingdom of priests and a holy nation </font>(see also 1 Peter 2:9)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    are supposed to lose their special character.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Zionists consider it a great 
    day when they declared the state of Israel to be in existence again when the 
    flag of their state was raised on a flagstaff in front of the United Nations 
    among the banners of all the other countries.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This creation of a secular, 
    so-called Jewish state is treason to the Jewish people, as constituted on 
    Mount Sinai. It is not only a crass degradation from a lofty and singular 
    level, but in thus changing the character and mission of the Jewish people, 
    it would also do the following:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Free the Jews as a people from 
    their religious obligations...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Subject the Jewish people to 
    the ordinary laws of national existence, thus ending the unique and extraordinary 
    qualities that let the Jews, as a people, survive through the millennia, and 
    make these people (G-d forbid) vanish like all the other nations that have 
    appeared on the surface of the earth and long since have been relegated to 
    history.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. It would automatically and inevitably--the 
    State of Israel now being a nation like the others, but claiming a special 
    relationship to Jews everywhere--force these Jews, in case of conflict, to 
    face and decide questions of their primary loyalty. It is hardly necessary 
    to add that this problem of loyalty has already been posed in a number of 
    countries during the past twenty years.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In this short presentation, 
    it is impossible to deal with the impact of Zionism on the United States, 
    although this would be a very interesting topic, or with the danger that it 
    creates for other countries. We are tonight concerned only with the difference 
    between Zionists and Jews who are loyal to their faith. </font>(What is true 
    for Jews and the State of Israel is also true for Christians and the United 
    States, as well as for Christians and all the other nations of the world in 
    which they reside...Revelation, chapter 18)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It might be mentioned that 
    there are minority groups and parties in Israel and elsewhere who try to combine 
    the traditional practice of the Jewish faith with Zionist activity, but by 
    its very nature, this is a hopeless cause. By accepting the leadership of 
    irreligious or anti-religious Jews, who under Jewish law are not qualified 
    to exercise any leadership or occupy any position of trust within the Jewish 
    community, and also by subjecting matters of faith and religious law to parliamentary 
    and other majority votes, they actually admit the priority of the secular 
    national Jewish state over the divinely instituted special nationhood of the 
    Jewish people...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The Holy Land (the Grand Idea 
    of a Holy and Promised Land) is and always has been beloved by Religious Jews 
    and that land, and the city of Jerusalem, are mentioned innumerable times 
    every single day in prayers said by Jews everywhere. These prayers have been 
    said for thousands of years, but they have nothing to do with the atheists 
    who founded the state of Israel or with their state. On the contrary, these 
    prayers also state that the Jews' exile from Eretz Yisroel is willed by the 
    Ruler and Father of us all; and as to self-respect because of victorious armies 
    and bombers, the Bible states that the Jews have been chosen because they 
    are the most humble and self-demeaning of all nations, not because of their 
    worldly or military power. And the fact, that during the past twenty years 
    more Jews have been killed in the Israeli wars than anywhere else on earth 
    and that more non-Jews have been killed there by Jews than anywhere else, 
    is not a source of pride, but one of deepest regret to all Jews who have not 
    been infected by the poison of Zionism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. It is not at all surprising 
    that so many Jews have been swayed by Zionism (as have Christians been swayed 
    by the even grander spirit of Zionism in America). Anyone who is surprised 
    by this fact reveals an abysmal ignorance of Jewish history. </font>(Quite 
    so)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Right from the start of Jewish 
    peoplehood--and it is significant that the Bible tells us that the Jews became 
    a nation in the wilderness, not in the land of Israel--it happened all too 
    often that the vast majority of Jews was misled and followed false prophets 
    and false gods, from the golden calf and the Baal, to the fake messianic movements 
    of all ages down to today's Zionism. But any student of Jewish history knows 
    also that, in the long run, all these movements failed and that only &quot;that&quot; 
    Judaism and &quot;those&quot; Jews survived as Jews who accepted the primacy 
    and totality of the Jewish written and oral law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. As to the state of Israel as 
    a place of refuge, this is perhaps the greatest fallacy of them all. Anyone 
    who has read such books as <i>Min Hametzar</i> by the late Rabbi Weismandel, 
    or <i>Perfidy</i> by the late Ben Hecht is aware of Zionist treachery during 
    the most critical time of the Nazi persecution. In fact, Zionism is most interested 
    in undermining the position of Jews in other countries so as to make them 
    emigrate to the state of Israel and this plan has already been systematically 
    carried out in a number of countries...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And finally, as to the Zionists 
    as the legitimate spokesmen for all Jews, they have been neither appointed 
    nor elected by a majority of Jews to speak or act for them. From a religious 
    point of view, they are completely and utterly disqualified from exercising 
    any function, even within a local Jewish community, let alone being authorized 
    to act on a national or international basis, except, of course, for Zionist 
    party members.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me sum up by repeating what 
    I initially said. A good Jew cannot be a Zionist. A Zionist cannot be a good 
    Jew.&quot;<font size="+1"> </font></font></p>

  <p><b>From this point on in every <i>amidah</i> until the <i>musaf </i>service 
    on the first day of Pesach, the congregation mentions that God is One Who 
    makes the wind blow and the rain fall.</b></p>
  <p><b>Once we experience the pleading of this prayer, the Sukkot water pouring 
    takes on a deeper quality. Perhaps it is not intended to coerce nature, but 
    to free the people from their own dryness so that they could one week later 
    plead with God. It is to be our prayers that water heaven, not the water poured 
    upon the ground.</b></p>
  <p><b>Why is the prayer for rain introduced into the blessing that praises God 
    for reviving the dead? Because rain revives the parched and deadened earth, 
    gives life to the seeds that are buried underground. And so as Sh'mini Atzeret 
    ends, we look once more to the great revival.</b></p>
  <p><b>In the afternoon, although Sukkot is over and it is no longer a <i>mitzvah</i> 
    to eat in the sukkah, the traditional custom was to eat there anyway one last 
    time, as a gesture of love and respect, and on leaving to say: &quot;JUST 
    AS I MERITED TO SIT IN THIS SUKKAH, MAY IT BE YOUR WILL THAT NEXT YEAR I MERIT 
    TO SIT IN THAT SUKKAH MADE FROM THE SKIN OF LEVIATHAN. NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM. 
    For when messiah comes, according to folk legend, God will turn leatherworker 
    (as at the end of Eden when God made leather garments for Eve and Adam). God 
    will at last slay the primeval sea monster Leviathan, and from its skin will 
    tailor the the Great Sukkah that enfolds all Israel in Peace. Under that sukkah 
    we will all sit, to dine on Leviathan's meat. No longer will we need to fear 
    a monster from the deeps--the ocean deep, or the depths of our own souls.&quot;
