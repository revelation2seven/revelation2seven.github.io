  <p><i>The man walking the tightrope between the demands of Russia's ultranationalists 
    and the desire to bring the country into a closer relationship with the West 
    is Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, 43. In an interview with </i>Time<i> last 
    week, he spoke about some of his concerns.</i></p>
  <p><b>TIME: What do you expect to accomplish at this week's G-7 meeting in Naples?</b></p>
  <p><b>KOZYREV: This is an important meeting, since we expect the G-7 to become 
    the G-8 (with Russia's inclusion). There should be important discussions on 
    world politics, the situation in Bosnia, Korea, nuclear nonproliferation, 
    other regional issues. But this is just the political aspect. We'll also try 
    to engage our partners in a more substantive discussion of Russian participation 
    in the economic field, since we are becoming a more and more active factor 
    in world markets.</b></p>
  <p><b>TIME: Are you encountering resistance from the G-7 nations to your inclusion?</b></p>
  <p><b>KOZYREV: Yes, of course. It's a particular situation on the one hand, 
    the need to include Russia is understood (by the G-7 partners), because it 
    is in the best interest of both Russia and the West. THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD 
    BE AWFUL: THE ISOLATION OF RUSSIA AND CONFRONTATION WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD--SOMETHING 
    EVERYONE WANTS TO AVOID. Still we face considerable difficulties when it comes 
    to practical matters. This is quite natural. Russia is a special case, SINCE 
    IT IS A MAJOR COUNTRY WITH INTERESTS BOTH IN THE EAST AND THE WEST. Sometimes 
    I wonder myself how we can balance these global interests...</b></p>
  <p><b>TIME: How do you build new partnerships while convincing everyone that 
    Russia does not have new imperial ambitions?</b></p>
  <p><b>KOZYREV: There is internal strife in Russia. There is a party of war, 
    new imperialists, even fascists...They called me a traitor for signing the 
    Partnership for Peace (with NATO)...There is a total lack of political culture 
    in the whole space of the former Soviet Union. The typical Soviet mentality 
    was to take up your rifle and grab power. We were brought up with these ideas. 
    One day Comrade Lenin did it, SO YOU TOO CAN SEIZE A GUN AND ESTABLISH A PARADISE 
    ON EARTH. Now there is more than one Comrade Lenin in our areas of ethnic 
    conflict. After they take up their rifles, they ask for Peacekeeping forces, 
    which really means, &quot;Be with us and help us defeat the other side--if 
    you don't you're imperialists.&quot; That is why we ask--beg--for an international 
    presence.</b></p>
  <p><b>TIME: Have you made any progress in persuading your Western partners not 
    to lecture you?</b></p>
  <p><b>KOZYREV: It's difficult, but I don't think it's a lost cause. Sometimes, 
    though, there is a real lack of sensitivity toward Russia, that strikes me 
    as too much self-assurance, even arrogance, PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN 
    WHAT THEY LEARNED IN COLD WAR TEXTBOOKS--THAT THERE WAS ONCE AN EVIL EMPIRE. 
    YOU CAN'T EXPECT ANGELS AND PARADISE TO APPEAR OVERNIGHT...</b></p>
  <p><b>TIME: Do you see any hope for Bosnia? Can Russia play a special role?</b></p>
  <p><b>KOZYREV: I'm active out of despair. We simply cannot afford to lose any 
    opportunity, since the alternative is clear: there will be growing confrontation 
    and hostility, and not just in Bosnia itself. THERE IS A REALISTIC SCENARIO 
    EMERGING THAT IS A REPETITION OF WHAT HAPPENED (IN THE BALKANS) AT THE BEGINNING 
    OF THE CENTURY, WHEN MAJOR POWERS CAME INTO CONFLICT...THIS COULD PRODUCE 
    A SITUATION WHERE THE U.S. MAY BE DRAWN INTO SUPPORTING ONE SIDE AND RUSSIA 
    SUPPORTING THE OTHER. WE HAVE TO GIVE SERIOUS THOUGHT TO THIS DOOMSDAY SCENARIO</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">What were we to make, not only of the appearance of the Soviet 
  order in 1917 but of its sudden dissolution? The world looked on in utter amazement 
  as the very structure and apparatus upon which Soviet Power was built collapsed 
  before our eyes. And not only that, but the antagonisms that existed between 
  the two world orders--which brought the world to the brink of apocalypse on 
  several occasions--seemed suddenly to have been resolved. Right at the time 
  it appeared that God was ready to bare His Holy Arm in the sight of the Western 
  powers He suddenly made it more possible for them to continue in their venturesome 
  ways--to continue their quest <a href="../UsedImages/Endgm-nto-iron.gif">to 
  create a world order</a> in their own image, and in their resolve to bring it 
  to pass. Right at the time the world seemed in dire need of that paradigm shift, 
  the kind that can come from heaven alone, the words in Marilyn Furguson's <i>Aquarian 
  Conspiracy</i> came to mind instead:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;But suddenly the crowd becomes solemn and despondent. The streets 
    empty quickly. Word comes from the frontier: 'The barbarians are not coming, 
    there are no more barbarians.' 'And now without the barbarians,' asks the 
    poet, 'what is to become of us? After all, they would have been a kind of 
    solution.'&quot;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The words, however, also sprang to mind which said: <i>For 
  God shall send them a strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.</i> (2 
  Thess.2:11). Despite the sudden optimism, it seemed obvious to some that this 
  lie was intricately bound to the sudden belief among the capitalist reformers 
  in Russia and the leaders of the Western world that the future belonged to them 
  now, and that even peace could, at last, be at hand.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">But what was really happening? Did Russia suddenly cease to 
  be the &quot;riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma&quot; that Churchill 
  described? Or could this really be a daring Russian, or Soviet trick as some 
  thought, a plot hatched upon the world stage from somewhere deep inside the 
  Kremlin walls, to draw the West into a state of complacency before the hammer--or 
  rather, before the Sickle fell? (Understand Joel 3:9-16 and read such works 
  as<i> The Great Universal Embrace, </i>by Kenneth Adelman, and <i>The Perestroika 
  Deception</i>, by Anatoliy Golitsyn; nor should we fail to mention <i>The Grand 
  Chessboard </i>by Zbigniew Brzezinski). Those who thought so were actually closer 
  to the truth than others, but for reasons well beyond theirs' and everyone else's 
  comprehension. For neither the Soviets (nor the Russians), had a hand in it--the 
  plot that is. All such plotting emanates from above, as it is written: <i>As 
  the heavens are higher than the earth...saith the Lord. </i>(Isaiah 55:7-11).</font></p>
<p align="center"><b>THE RUSSIAN IDEA</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>In <i>The Russian Idea </i>Berdyaev allows the reader to span seventy, 
    and twice seventy, years and reach back into the living history of Russia's 
    finest thinkers. In this book we can hear, as if rising from the depths, from 
    under the rubble, the prophetic voice of the spirit of Russia as Berdyaev, 
    in the mood of humility and pride characteristic of Christian mystical-philosophical-existentialism, 
    proclaims it. This spirit--which IS the Russian idea--speaks of a vision of 
    the world very different from our own and very different from the ways in 
    which recent history has allowed us to imagine Russia. IT IS INTENSELY SPIRITUAL--APOCALYPTIC, 
    ESCHATOLOGICAL--and yet at the same time deeply personal, overflowing with 
    character and experience, speaking in a unique voice from one heart to another. 
    This voice of Russia, as Berdyaev utters it, speaks of first, last, and present 
    things but in a way we are not used to--holistically, integrally, cosmically, 
    and with a special emphasis on the <i>Sobornost</i> or all-togetherness of 
    human beings viewed not as material entities but as spiritual images of the 
    divine. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Russian Idea, by 
    Nikolai Berdyaev, p.10.</font></p>
  <p><b>&quot;I wrote in my book on Dostoyevsky that the Russians are apocalyptics 
    or nihilists. The Russian is an apocalyptic revolt against antiquity (Spengler). 
    This means that the Russian people, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR METAPHYSICAL 
    NATURE AND VOCATION IN THE WORLD, ARE A PEOPLE OF THE END. Apocalypse has 
    always played a great part both among the masses of our people and at the 
    highest cultural level, among Russian writers and thinkers. IN OUR THOUGHTS 
    THE ESCHATOLOGICAL PROBLEM TAKES AN IMMEASURABLY GREATER PLACE THAN IN THE 
    THINKING OF THE WEST, AND THIS IS CONNECTED WITH THE VERY STRUCTURE OF RUSSIAN 
    CONSCIOUSNESS...</b></p>
  <p><b>Roman Catholic thought fears the eschatological interpretation of Christianity 
    since it opens up possibilities of dangerous innovations. The spirit which 
    strives TOWARDS THE WORLD WHICH IS TO COME, THE MESSIANIC EXPECTATION, is 
    incompatible with the academic socially organized character of Roman Catholicism; 
    it evokes fears that the possibility of the direction of souls might be weakened. 
    In the same way bourgeois society, believing in nothing whatever, fears that 
    eschatological thought might loosen the foundations of that bourgeois society...</b></p>
  <p><b>In years of catastrophe the apocalyptic mentality has made its appearance 
    in European society. Such was the case after the French Revolution and the 
    Napoleonic wars. At that time Jung-Stilling prophesied THE NEAR APPEARANCE 
    OF ANTICHRIST...Nearer to the Russians were the prophesies of Joachim of Floris 
    about a new era of the Holy Spirit, an era of love, friendship and freedom, 
    although all this was too much associated with monarchism. The figure of St. 
    Francis of Assisi has close affinities with the Russians, Saint Francis who 
    redeemed many of the sins of historical Christianity. But the Christian civilization 
    of the West was organized outside of eschatological expectation. I must explain 
    what I understand by eschatology. I have in mind not the eschatological sections 
    of theological Christianity which one can find in every course on theology, 
    whether Catholic or Protestant; I have in mind the eschatological interpretation 
    of Christianity as a whole, which must be opposed to the historical interpretation 
    of Christianity. THE CHRISTIAN REVELATION IS AN ESCHATOLOGICAL REVELATION, 
    A REVELATION OF THE END OF THE WORLD, A REVELATION OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD. 
    The whole of primitive Christianity was eschatological. It expected the second 
    Advent of Christ and the coming of the Kingdom of God. Historical Christianity 
    and the Church of history indicate failure in the sense that the Kingdom of 
    God has not come; they indicate failure, owing to the accommodation of Christian 
    revelation to the kingdom of this world. There remains, therefore, in Christianity 
    the Messianic Hope, the eschatological expectation, and it is stronger in 
    Russian Christianity than in the Christianity of the West. The Church is not 
    the Kingdom of God; the Church has appeared in history and it has acted in 
    history; it does not mean the <i>transfiguration of the world</i>, the appearance 
    of a new heaven and a new earth. THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS THE TRANSFIGURATION 
    OF THE WORLD, NOT ONLY THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL MAN, BUT ALSO 
    THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC; AND THAT IS THE END OF THE 
    WORLD, OF THE WORLD OF WRONG AND UGLINESS, AND IT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF A NEW 
    WORLD, A WORLD OF RIGHT AND BEAUTY...</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

  the Spirit's descent into the spiritual, intellectual, emotional and physical 
  range of human existence, so each of these texts are referring to the various 
  spirits that indwell humanity. Likewise, where we are prohibited by Moses from 
  laying with a beast (see Leviticus 18:23-25; Deut.27:21), it is a prohibition 
  against intercourse or marriage with other persons whose world-view is lower 
  or less developed than our own, or whose beliefs (or non-beliefs) will cause 
  confusion in the spiritual life of any children born to this union. Lacking 
  a center the children will wander <i>to and fro</i> in the earth, and not finding 
  it they will create new centers, as they did in the time of ancient Egypt, or 
  Nineveh, Athens and Rome, London or Washington D.C., whose inhabitants must 
  always, in their own continued self-interests, remain at war against the True 
  Center of All Things which is God. And God is <i>a God of War</i>, <i>that is 
  His Name </i>(Exodus 15:3; Revelation 15:1-3), This is the supreme reality of 
  our time.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="+1">ADAM, NOT THE FIRST HUMAN BEINGS, BUT THE 
    FIRST OF THE ANCIENT ANGELIC ORDER TO PERCEIVE AND UNDERSTAND THE UNITY OF 
    ALL THINGS. ADAM WAS THE FIRST MONOTHEISTS IN THE EARTH.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><i><font size="+1">When the Most High divided to the nations 
    their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of 
    the people according to the number of the children of Israel...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 
    32:8). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">All of this translates in the Scriptures into terms of the 
  struggle that has been waged since the time of Adam, between the newly-created 
  mind of Light in the world (afterwards symbolized by Abel, and then by Seth), 
  which is able to perceive the Presence of God in all things, and in every other 
  being, and the mind of Darkness (symbolized by Cain), which cannot. God ordained 
  this struggle from the very beginning when They created the heaven and the earth 
  (Genesis 1:1), that is, when They set some things <i>above</i> or <i>beyond</i> 
  human understanding, and some things <i>below</i>, or rather <i>within</i> our 
  range of mental perceptions. Thus the words:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of 
    God ascending and descending upon the Son of man...</font></i><font size="+1">(John 
    1:51). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The struggle was activated tens of thousands of years before 
  Cain and Abel when God placed in the very first human beings the first mixture 
  of these two lights--the greater light to rule the Day, and the lesser light 
  to rule the Night. (Genesis 1:14-18; 1 Thess.5). This means that God placed 
  in those first human spirits a potential ability to distinguish a higher way 
  from a lower--and in the primal human sense this involved a simple moral equation 
  involving the means of distinguishing those ways that enhance life (which was 
  good), from those that enhance death (which was evil). It was the first, basic 
  level of discerning Light (life) from Darkness (death). It was primarily utilitarian 
  in nature, not yet spiritual, yet served in time to balance the impulse for 
  self preservation with a higher ethic, and with the possibilities of social 
  conventions founded in the rule of law. In time--thousand and thousands of years 
  later, as the human mind was slowly prepared for it, God finally appeared to 
  that (archetypal) human couple we know as Adam. It was then that God placed 
  in humanity an ability to transcend the common sense of life and death (those 
  ideas associated with good and evil, light and darkness), and allowed <i>man 
  </i>to see into the hidden order above. God gave Adam a glimpse of Their own 
  invisible Presence as the Single Unifying Force in the universe, as the authors 
  of both Day and Night, of both Life and Death. For a moment in time <i>man</i> 
  realized that both Good and Evil flowed from the very same source. Adam--not 
  the first human beings--was the first monotheists. They were also the first 
  intentional pacifists in the earth, as it is written: <i>Follow peace with all 
  men, without which no man shall see the Lord</i>. (Hebrews 12:14). (Pacifism, 
  it follows, must be the first-fruit of the Beautific Vision, the first result 
  of one's ability to perceive the Presence of God in All things).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Adam was now set aside and distinguished from the rest of the 
  primal human order. A new human order had been born. As such their minds were 
  caught up into another dimension to the meaning of Life. They (Adam) realized 
  that physical life was merely an image (an illusion if you will), or a reflection 
  below of the higher reality that exists above--just beyond the range of normal 
  human comprehension. God brought them into the Greater Light and placed them 
  in the Garden of the Tree of Life--upon whose limbs all the mysteries of the 
  Higher Realm are revealed and preserved. (And we reason that sometime prior 
  to the events we associate with the <i>Fall of man</i>, and the subsequent collapse 
  of the Atlantean age, the spirit of Adam also came across the sea to the land 
  we now call America, enacting in their own lives the later history of the Nation-Church 
  that would rise up in their name). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(We also reason that no one can tell what physical race Adam 
  belonged to, or even that the first adepts of these mysteries were concerned 
  about it, because the literary <i>Adam</i> of the Bible is an archetype, and 
  their seed is not a physical seed but spiritual [understand John 1:12,13]. These 
  mysteries went on to take hold in every continent, and among every race of humankind. 
  And though these mysteries were first centered in Europe for what are now very 
  obvious geo-metaphysical and historical reasons, we reason that the first adepts 
  of this science, who were represented by every race together, understood why 
  and agreed to it).</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>Isaiah, chapters 27 to 20; Matthew, chapter 24; Luke 21...(KJV)</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Adam went from being able to distinguish good from bad, in 
  its earthly, physical sense, to being able to distinguish the two from the One 
  invisible Force that inhabits all things, the good and the evil alike, as Paul 
  would say in time: <i>All things are working to the good for those that love 
  God, and who are called according to God's purposes</i> (even those things that 
  appear to be evil). The Unity of things-above was discovered to be an integral 
  part, and the central reality of the duality of things-below. Adam learned that 
  there are two kinds of Darkness: the Darkness wherein God hides (Psalm 18:11), 
  and the darkness which keeps the mind of man from realizing that God is hiding 
  in the Darkness. It is the latter form of darkness that we must fight against--and 
  this battle must be waged against the &quot;self,&quot; not against other human 
  beings, for to fight against other human beings in the Name of God is to be 
  fighting against God Himself. They learned that there are two kinds of Death: 
  that which no human soul can avoid, the eventual death of the body, and the 
  kind that brings about the death of the lower nature and the lower intellect, 
  bringing the mind onto the plains of higher consciousness. This is the death 
  that Paul speaks of when he says: <i>Know ye not that ye who are baptized into 
  Christ are baptized into his death? </i>(Romans 6:3)...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which 
    are above, where Christ sitteth on the Right Hand of God.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Set your affections on things above, not on things on 
    the earth.</font></i></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Such a death leads the mind upwards, into the higher heavens. 
  Paul spoke of being caught up (or <i>raptured</i>), to the <a href="SideLinks/Paradise.htm">Third 
  Heaven</a> where he saw visions of Paradise and discovered the cosmic as well 
  as the historic dimensions of the Tree of Life. And in the books of Enoch we 
  read of that angel's ascent to the Seventh and Tenth heavens, there being a 
  heaven corresponding to each of the Ten sefirot of the Tree of Life, thus to 
  each of the heavenly spheres that divide the earth, the Sun and Moon, the planets, 
  and the stars from one another, and therefore the various states of mind of 
  which humankind is possessed from one another as well. We all dwell on the same 
  physical planet, but we are not all of the same cosmic state of mind as it is

  times--before the Spirit finally instructed Nicholas Copernicus to put things 
  back in their rightful place in the 16th century. The Earth-centered system 
  taught man (Adam) how to sense his own central place in the cosmic scheme of 
  things, and to realize that he was, indeed, the Temple of the Living God, and 
  the repository of the Living Oracles. His own limbs were an extension of his 
  own mind, and could project his thoughts into the Four quarters of the starry 
  heavens and back. These seers (these ancient adepts of the hidden science) also 
  discovered that if humanity was, indeed, created in the image of God (and if 
  the Heaven and Earth were somehow what God looked like), then the heavenly bodies 
  which moved about the earth, from East to West, each in their own spheres, were 
  a sure sign of the various operations of God's Hands--not merely in the heavens 
  above, but in the heavenly affairs of the whole human family. As above, so below

<p><font size="+1">We described the Ark in the fourth chapter of this work. We

  first line is a record of the vast time that passed between the Creation of 
  the universe (the Great Emanation), and the time six cosmic days later, when 
  God appeared to the mind the Adam. (Genesis 1:1-27). The second line is also, 
  according to the Scriptures, divided into six days of one thousand years each. 
  It reflects the period of time that has transpired between God's revelation 
  to Adam, six thousand years ago, and our own time. Together these lines create 
  the dimensions of the Ark which is 300 cubits long and 50 cubits wide, or Six 
  times longer than it is wide. Then into this vessel we layed the structure of 
  the Tree of Life itself...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Making proper use of the Oracle then, which has been preserved

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;What man of sense will agree with the statement that the first, 
    second, and third days, in which evening is named and the morning, were without

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Agreeing with Origen that the material sun, moon, and stars 
  came forth on the first day of creation, we ask, then what do the Scriptures 
  mean when they say?...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And God said, let there be lights in the firmament of

    1:14-19).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Genesis 1:14-19 speaks of the higher, spacial regions of the 
  universe. Genesis 1:20-23 speaks of the middle, or the fluid regions, the sea 
  and the air. And Genesis 1:24,25 speaks of the earth, or the solid region of 
  matter. And the three are compared to events that took place on the Fourth, 
  Fifth, and Sixth days of creation. But just as the text is not referring to 
  the formation of the material sun and the moon, or the stars in space, so neither 
  is it referring to the creation of literal birds and fish, or four-footed beasts 
  in the earth. It refers rather to the Three-storied creation and development 
  of the human life-force--of God's descent from the higher regions of His/Her 
  own Spiritual domain, into the planet Earth, the creation of the human life-force 
  on the Fourth day, and His rising up in time (His own awakening if you will), 
  in the mind of Adam....</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/FourDomains.gif" width="217" height="415"></p>
<p><font size="+1">The verses speak of the formation of the Higher Spirit in man; 
  of the Soul of man (the middle region where spirit and form meet); and of the 
  Body, or the lower material form of man itself. These verses speak of the spiritual 
  domain, apart from the lower animal world that <i>man</i> inhabits; and then 
  his intellectual and emotional qualities (the center of the Soul); and his sensual 
  and physical qualities (the Body or the Flesh). It speaks of the Descent of 
  God into human form, from the highest state of reality to the lowest--into the 
  very primal (angelic) state of human consciousness itself, from which God has 
  been elevating the mind of humanity since the time of Adam. They speak of the 
  fact that the Tree of Life provided the model for the very first totem, which 
  reflected the symbiotic relationship that existed between the soul of man and 
  the soul of animals. They speak of the realization that when God first inspired 
  and formed the mind of Adam in the earth, thousands upon thousands of years 
  after the first humans were created, that Adam was able to look back across 
  the world in which they lived and was able to look within and discern the nature 
  of the various spirits that inhabited and motivated the rest of human kind. 
  Some of their fellow human beings, like some of the other animal creatures around 
  them, were violent and cruel. Others were gentle and kind. Some had the characteristics 
  of the Fowls of the air (understand Genesis 15:11 and Jeremiah 7:33), all were 
  like the fish of the sea. All of them functioning naturally and instinctively, 
  even as God still gives them direction. (Every one on earth, except <i>Adam</i>, 
  is obeying God. Only <i>Adam </i>has the power to disobey as it is written: 
  <i>For where no Torah is, there is no transgression...</i>Romans 4:15). And 
  while the entire human family is angelic in nature some in the human family 
  were set aside to do the work of warring angels--fiery angels.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And another glory of the Stars, for one star differeth 
    from another star in glory...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 Corinthians 15:41).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Where then is the creation of the literal animal kingdom on 
  earth referred to in Genesis? In the words: <i>Let the earth bring forth grass</i> 
  (Gen.1:11), as it is also written: <i>All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness 
  thereof is as the flower of the field. </i>(Isaiah 40: 6,7). Life on earth, 
  however, first appeared with the words: <i>Let there be light.</i> (Gen.1:3). 
  For in the language of the Scriptures Life and Light are equal to one another. 
  Also, as we follow the second, or lower line in the structure of the Ark, from 
  the Fourth day to the present, we notice two things: First, that God began to 
  shape the physical and intellectual dimensions of humanity at the same time 
  on the upper line as They (the Divine Mother and Father) appeared to the world 
  in Christ on the second line--when the words began to take effect which say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For God, who commanded the light (Life) to shine out of 
    darkness, hath shined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge 
    of the glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ. (the Great Spiritual Sun)...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Corinthians 4:6).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> We conclude then that the events of the Fourth day refer to 
  that time in the way distant past when God--who had already created the visible 
  heavens, and whose own Great Invisible Presence already filled the heavens and 
  the earth--rose up in the Earth to create and indwell the first truly human 
  species, as it is written: <i>When the morning Stars sang together. </i>(Job 
  38:7). Thus we reason that these lights are not only broken up now into the 
  sparks that kindle the conscious soul of every living being (for every single 
  human being is descended from the very same elements that were created in the 
  center of great fiery, distant stars), but are the same that burn continuously 
  from generation to generation in the Living Temple of God itself. This Temple 
  is maintained by Adam, that is, by the mind of Christ. </font></p>

  hidden as they were from the mind of Darkness--were to be tended by Aaron and

  the children of the Day from the children of the Night in the last day, as Paul

  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus some members of the human family seemed to be &quot;fixed&quot; 
  in place, just like the stars. They appear inflexible and somehow differently 
  disciplined than others. According to the Divine Law of Correspondances we have 
  been likening some of the families of Asia, China, the Koreas and Japan, and 
  especially the Soviet spirit to these heavenly bodies. It is like staring up 
  at the Seven Stars of the Great Bear Constellation, and realizing as the ancients 
  did, that &quot;it alone has no part in the baths of Ocean.&quot; Which means 
  that it has no rising and setting. The minds that governed the old Soviet political 
  and military order (and we speak of it as if it still exists), have not been 
  called up into the fulness of the (Solar) mysteries of Christ, and cannot, therefore, 
  fall from its precepts, disobey its commandments, or resist its transformative 
  influences--as those &quot;fallen angels&quot; who boast of their exalted place 
  in the spiritual order of things here in the West. Others have called this constellation 
  the Mariner's Escort, because it sits alone in the heavens (always in the North), 
  guiding the direction (the fate) of those who &quot;go down to the sea in ships.&quot; 
  (See Psalm 107)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus other members of the human family have taken journeys, 
  not only from one end of the earth to the other, but from one state of mind<b>--</b>through 
  a whole range of spiritual, intellectual and emotional transformations--to another. 
  Chief among these bodies are the Sun and the Moon. The ancient adepts, as they 
  studied how the Sun gives its light to the Moon, and how she receives it, began 
  to associate these two with the two side of the oracles of Life, the Male side 
  and the Female side. Later the prophets also associated them with the two tribes, 
  Levi and Judah (<a href="SideLinks/TheSunandMoon.htm">Christianity and Judaism</a>), 
  as it is written: <i>And he hath made us priests and kings unto God.</i> (Revelation 
  1:6). &quot;As above so below,&quot; was the maxim, and by use of it the prophets 
  were not only able to divine the mysteries of the human spirit but the future 
  direction of historical events...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Sun and Moon moved according to mind of the ancients within 
  a set of spheres that were vastly interior to the fixed Stars. But the Planets, 
  these too moved along lines removed from the Stars. They accompanied the Sun 
  and Moon along their circuits. Unlike the two, however, who moved according 
  to established and observable ordinances, the Planets gave the impression of 
  being an unruly group who could not agree on any set course. Because they were 
  always in such a state of disagreement the prophets saw in them the figures 
  of those Gentiles (who appear heavenly), who would accompany the Nation-church 
  to the ends of the Earth, and who are all presently mingled in the same Western 
  sky with her:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were 
    before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the Grace 
    of God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord YHShWH.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast 
    with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water,

    own shame; </font></i><font size="+1"><i>WANDERING STARS, to whom is reserved 
    the blackness of darkness forever...</i>(Jude 4:12,13).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">1982 (a pivotal year in the general nature of the times, when 
  the great American Prophet, Ronald Reagan, was in power), opened with a sign 
  from heaven which was variously perceived by those who possess a spiritual sense 
  of the times, and variously scoffed at by those who lack a sense of God's awesome 
  Presence in the affairs of the world. One headline read: &quot;Jupiter Effect 
  Fails to Bring Doom; No Increased Solar Activity Bombarded the Earth Yesterday...the 
  Day of the So-Called Jupiter Effect.&quot; Another read:</font></p>
<blockquote>

    around the Sun in a 98.3 arc every 179 years...but in addition this time,

    This marked the first time the three events occurred simultaneously since 
    949 A.D.</b></p>

<p><font size="+1">The February 14, 1982 New York Times reported: &quot;March 
  Doomsday? Don't Plan On It...Will the world come to an end on March 10, or at 
  least suffer earthquakes, because the planets are lined up in a devastating 
  configuration?...Religious tracts have notified millions around the world of 
  this idea by relating it to biblical prophecy and the current fashion to predict 
  the imminent end of the world.&quot; Had these reporters access to the ancient 
  maxims <i>(As above, so below)</i>,<i> </i>they might have wondered if there 
  was any correlation between these celestial events and the historic fact that 
  while the peoples of the West are assembled on the same side of the heavens 
  as the Sun and the Moon (at the places numbered Seven and Eight on the Tree 
  of Life), they have forsaken the ordinances of <a href="SideLinks/TheSunandMoon.htm">Levi 
  and Judah</a>, as well as the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Measure thou the time diligently in itself; and when thou 
    seest part of the signs past which I told you before...Then thou shalt understand 
    that it is the very same time wherein the Most High will begin to visit the 
    world which He made.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore when there shall be earthquakes, AND UPROARS 
    OF PEOPLES IN THE WORLD, then shalt thou well understand that the Most High 
    spake of these things from the beginning.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For as like all that is made in the world hath a beginning

    plain beginnings in wonders and powerful works, and endings in effects and 
    signs...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 Esdras 9:1-6).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The significance of March 10 of that year was not in the planets' 
  alignment, but in their disalignment. God set the cycles of the planets and 
  other heavenly bodies in motion long ago so that they would come together in 
  this particular disarrangement on the very day that they did...<i>Wherefore 
  they call these days Purim. </i>(Esther 9:24-32). March 9, and 10 fell on 15 
  Adar, the day of Purim. Doomsday? Not for the children of Israel. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Ronald Reagan proclaimed 1983 The Year of the Bible; John-Paul 
  named it The Holy Year of Redemption. Perhaps they had witnessed the Seventh 
  and final eclipse of 1982 (December 29). It was a spectacular affair. On this 
  morning the Sun and the Moon could be seen rising together...</font></p>

      that Ursa accounts for the whole northern Seven mystique already had arisen. 
      ...We need to ask (however) what status Ursa Major had in the Middle East 
      and whether it was conspicuous enough to promote the mystique derived from 
      it. We also need to ask whether the mystique took shape there independently

      Mesopotamia as the Seven Sages (and later as the Bishops of the Seven Churches)...</b></p>
    <p><b>If the Seven mystique in the Middle East was a product of Ursa Major

      were great sea-farers, they steered by Ursa Minor. (?) Yet Semites had the 
      same mystique as the Sumerians. An outside influence is needed...That is 
      what we already have in the Indo-Aryan context (the original Shemites). 
      Santillana and von Dechend hit on it in the passage quoted; where they say

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">So when we read of how the children of Seth went down in ancient 
  times to cohabit with the darker spirits, it was not their natural genes that 
  were getting lost (there is absolutely no prohibition in the Law of God against 
  intermarriage between the natural races of human kind), but it was the instructions 
  and the teachings of their parents--the spiritual adepts who lived at that time--that 
  were being confused. The teachings of Adam/Manu were new in the earth, for in 
  Adam God was creating an entirely new order of humankind--a new angelic order, 
  the order of <i>Man</i>. These teachings involved the precepts of the Oneness 
  of God's Presence in the sum of all things--in the ways of peace as well as 
  in the ways of war, in the evil as well as the good. (This was a very radical 
  departure from the common view of reality, and still is). And as a result these 
  teachings carried with them an absolute requirement and dedication to the principles 
  of pacifism (giving birth to the spirit of Abel), without which the whole idea 
  of the Oneness of God, and of a truly New Order of humanity collapses, and is 
  rendered meaningless. The precepts, of course, were forsaken.</font></p>

    earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
    continually...</font></i><font size="+1">(Genesis 6:3-5).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And <i>Giants</i> were born unto them. This means that as the 
  confusion that was engendered between the union of the one state of mind and 
  the other took hold (one pacifistic and Christ-like, and the other natural and 
  war-like), it increased and grew up to govern the thinking of &quot;large&quot; 
  amounts of people. The Roman Church is one such giant (it is none other than 
  Goliath himself), as are the Russian, the European, and American empires in 
  our times (not to fail to mention the giant corportions that are presently treading 
  roghshod over the earth). So, as the teachings, and those emerging Atlantean 
  and Indo-European tribes who subscribed to them, grew in power and stature among 
  the ancient peoples of the earth, giants appeared and the cult of Nimrod was 
  born. (And therefore the hiding and the allegorization of the mysteries by the 
  true spiritual adepts of those times. The sons of Darkness--the spirit of Cain 
  and Nimrod--were getting hold of the ideas and were perverting them, just as 
  they are at this very time in history)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Unable to rise up to the higher meanings of things, the sons 
  of Darkness (Cain and his ilk), conscripted the teachings and brought them down, 
  forcing upon them their own reasonings and interpretations in order to make 
  them conform to their own fallen world view. And so it says that <i>It repented 
  God that He had made man in the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart.</i> 
  (Genesis 6:6-13). But how, we ask, could God be grieved to have happening in 
  the earth exactly what They ordained to happen? Had They no foresight? Was there 
  a force lurking in the cosmos that was equal, or more powerful than They, something 
  that could upset the creative design? Did God not let Truth fall, so that the 
  mind of humanity could witness the effects of it all? And did They not follow 
  it up with Truth again and again in the form of revelation, and send it out 
  into the world again and again, in order to overturn the works of Darkness and 
  gather all things together in the Mystery of Christ in the last day? If these 
  things are so, then we must rise above the written word in order to interpret 
  it. It says that it &quot;repented&quot; God, not because God was confused, 
  or because God discovered that They had somehow made a terrible mistake in creating 
  man, but because the written word came into the earth to produce certain effects 
  in the heart and mind of man. It requires us to question it, to look within 
  it in order to discover its fullest meanings. And at last it drives the God-within-us 
  to repentance as we discover our own part in this drama, and as we survey the 
  worldwide effects of our own fallen state.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We may extend the same logic to the words: <i>For, behold, 
  the Lord will come with Fire, and with His chariots, to render His anger with 
  fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.</i> (Isaiah 66:15). For how can God 
  be angry at the things They themselves have created? Especially at a people 
  that has no more of a higher mind in them than God was willing to impart. The 
  meaning is not that God is &quot;angry&quot; but that the forces of Divine Justice 
  that God has created will render their anger (if we can perceive it is as such), 
  or their righteous indignation, upon the forces of Darkness that God also created. 
  But humanity first had to experience this face of Darkness, this spirit of disobedience 
  and violence, oppression, and injustice, that has come into the world in the 
  Name of God. We had to experience it so that we could also see for ourselves 
  what God absolutely will not tolerate in the age to come. God is demonstrating 
  it by rising up against the wickedness in humanity in the collective form of 
  humanity itself. How will future generations know when God is risen? When that 
  which is Darker than darkness has risen, and when that which is more Deadly 
  than death itself is abroad in the earth. (Deut.32:39-42; Daniel 12:7; Rev.10:5,6):</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">What are the &quot;borders of wickedness?&quot;</font><i><font size="+1"> 
  </font></i><font size="+1">They are the extent of understanding, or the limits 
  to which the children of this world (Esau) will travel within their own narrow, 
  cultural, religious, and nationalistic points of view (but no further), in pursuit 
  of the knowledge of God. As soon as one transcends their own limited world-view, 
  and enters the domain of correct interpretation and right action, they have 
  come upon the borders <a href="../UsedImages/land.gif">of the Promised Land</a>--the 
  Land of Israel.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are those in the Black Revisionist movement who contend 
  that <i>Esau</i> is the &quot;white man&quot; pure and simple, and that God 
  hates him pure and simple. While European man definitely bears the burden of 
  the word spoken against Esau, the belief itself is childish and not very well 
  thought out. First of all it is unscientific, and holds that Esau (the White 
  race) and Jacob (the Black race) were literally (not figuratively) born from 
  the same womb, at the same time, one hated and one loved. (Genesis 25:23). Like 
  others who espouse such ideas, it leaves us with a God who is cold and emotionless, 
  responsive only to the physical struggles of some of Their children (Their Black 
  children for instance), but not to the psychological and spiritual, thus not 
  to the inner, as well as epic struggles and supplications of Their other children. 
  The doctrine itself falls apart when subject to the rigorous disciplines of 
  higher thought, nor does it take into account the import of the words which 
  say: <i>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of 
  the will of man, but of God. </i>(John 1:13). Besides, no one can tell what 
  &quot;color&quot; a person actually is until they find out what frequency that 
  soul is resonating at. The outer man is just a shell or a garment containing 
  the spiritual essence of the individual--the soul, and must ultimately be set 
  aside, and all attachments to it broken, as the soul enters the spiritual realm. 
  </font><font size="+1">Esau rather, like his brother Jacob, is another literary 
  archetype, a figure of the Hebrew genius. He never actually existed. He is ultimately 
  the figure of every one, regardless of race and nationality, who hates his brother, 
  and who over the long process of history has learned to express this hatred 
  through the <a href="../UsedImages/ranti.gif">use of the sword</a> and <a href="../UsedImages/anti.gif">other 
  forms of violence</a>. Esau is another figure of the &quot;natural man,&quot; 
  one who lacks an understanding of spiritual matters, and of the process of spiritual 
  maturation in others:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We will recall in the previous chapters that we applied the 
  words at Hebrews 12:14-17 (which are an allusion to the king of Babylon's vision 
  in Daniel, chapter 4), to the likes of Thomas Woodrow Wilson who rose up to 
  brandish the sword of <i>Christian righteousness</i> during the First World 
  War, and the description of Esau to those who followed him and all the presidents 
  after him right into the events of our time. We applied the words concerning 
  Esau to all those in the West who would continue to sacrifice their birthright 
  to the kingdom of God for one extra measure of material comfort or physical 
  well-being--while their more spiritual brothers and sisters are offering the 
  kind of spiritual sacrifices, and experiencing the kind of hardships and persecutions 
  that come with attempting to live a <i>true</i> spiritual witness in America...

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And as we worked our way into the twists and turns of the Hebrew 
  oracles w</font><font size="+1">e said that just as Jacob was never a literal, 
  individual person, but rather a Hebrew archetype (a figure of humanity itself), 
  so likewise, Esau is also a Hebrew &quot;type.&quot; The two are another in 
  a series of &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;twin&quot; figures that speak to the 
  common elements of light and darkness that dwell in every individual. We also 
  reasoned that Jacob has his own dark side, his own mirror image in the world 
  below, a beguiling one who appears in the garments of light, a subtle one who 
  comes with the name of James (Jacob). We said: <i>Be not as Esau</i>, who gave 
  up his birthright to the world above.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The figure of Esau, however, like all spiritual phenomena, 
  is also subject to the Law of Correspondences which states: &quot;As above so 
  below,&quot; and by further reasoning &quot;As in the West so in the East.&quot; 
  Just as we can trace the warrior spirit of America (the modern Chaldeans) across 
  Germanic Europe, back to the Scythes who descended out of the steppes of Russia 
  in the 6th century B.C. (the original forces of Gog and Magog), so we can trace 
  the path of the figurative Esau into the steppes and plains of ancient Russia 
  as well. This spirit of Esau ventured into the East from the center of the Oracles 
  thousands of years before it came across the times to the West in the mystery 
  of Christ...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Jacob was commanded to go on a journey, away from the spiritual 
  center of the Hebrew mysteries, in order to</font><i><font size="+1"> </font></i><font size="+1">discover 
  the meanings of life itself. It is the path every truly spiritual individual 
  takes away from the moment of its own conception, or away from the times of 
  its own innocence, or from its first moment of spiritual inspiration. It is 
  the path of spiritual maturation. And along the way he was commanded to take 
  a wife, not from among the Canaanites but from among his own kinsmen--the Syrians. 
  This, because in the allegorical meanings of the Hebrew Scriptures <i>Syria</i> 
  is a symbol of Israel's own lower nature, his own peculiar wanderings--just 
  as the Canaanites and their kinsmen are a symbol of the lower nature of the 
  Gentiles...</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God, 
    A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned 
    there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, 
    and laid upon us hard bondage..</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 26:1-10)..</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> And where it says: <i>When thou art come into the land which 
  the Lord thy God giveth thee</i>, interpret it to mean: <i>When thou art come 
  into the State of Mind which the Lord thy God giveth thee</i>. The <i>Syrian 
  ready to perish</i> in this text is each person's own former self). The journey 
  is one of human experience, and the <i>women</i> Jacob will encounter along 
  the way, and marry, is Divine Wisdom. It is She who reveals Herself in the depths 
  and in the fulness of human experience itself--She is present everywhere, and 
  is the author Herself of the entire Human story. This is why Jacob marries Four 
  wives because Divine Wisdom has apportioned Herself throughout all Four directions 
  of the earth. Jacob is a figure of the spiritual aspirant (the spiritual nation) 
  who, preordained in his or her own lifetime, will eventually attain to this 
  Wisdom, wrestle with their own angel, overcome themself and the world, and finally 
  return to the center. Esau however:</font></p>

    the last Russian tsar, Nicholas II.</b></p>
  <p><b>Tsar Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra, and their four children were killed

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Scriptures speak of <i>The kings that reigned in the land 
  of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel </i>(Genesis 36:31-36; 
  1 Chronicles 1:43-50). To the Kabbalist these rulers of Edom represent the &quot;Unbalanced 
  State of Mind.&quot; They represent every form of government, as well as every 
  pattern of individual human thought, that is <a href="SideLinks/TheBalances.htm">out 
  of balance</a>, out of harmony, or out of alignment with the hidden, </font><font size="+1"><a href="SideLinks/Dimensions.htm">universal 
  dimensions</a> of the Tree of Life. They represent every mind unwilling, or 
  incapable of comprehending, not only the perfectly balanced principles of creation--the 
  same that are unfolding and revealing themselves to the mind of Man--but the 
  universal intentions of the Mind of Nature itself as they are also unfolding 
  and revealing themselves everywhere in the world around us. Thus the kings of 
  Edom come to power at the end of every age when the Darkness, and the resistance 
  to the Light is at its greatest intensity, as it is written: <i>Beware of the 
  leaven of Herod. </i>(Mark 8:15). Herod too was an Edomite king, and all the 
  things we believe to have happened in his time actually represent things that 
  will finally come to pass in our time. The Edomite kings represent the state 
  of mind that existed in the world just prior to the words: <i>And let there 
  be light. </i>(Genesis 1:2; Jeremiah 4:23):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;This we have learned in the Book of Concealed Mystery: that the 
    Ancient of the Ancient Ones before he prepared His conformations (in the equilibrium 
    of balance) formed certain kings, collected certain kings, and gave due proportion 
    unto certain kings; but they only subsisted for a time until He could expel 
    them; and in that time He hath concealed them. </b></p>
  <p><b>This is intimated in the words, Gen.36:31: 'And these are the kings which 
    have reigned in Edom. In the land of Edom;' that is, in the place where all 
    judgments exist.</b></p>
  <p><b>But all these subsisted not until the Head (Kether) of the Ancient of 
    the Ancient Ones was disposed. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(This 
    means, not until, or not before God revealed Their own Presence to Adam in 
    the higher dimensions of Reality, as it is written: <i>Where there is no law 
    there is no transgression</i>...Where there is no Balance, or Unity, there 
    cannot be Imbalance or Disunity...Where there is no Order there cannot be 
    Disorder<i>...</i>Romans 4:15</font><b>). When this was conformed, He disposed 
    all the inferior conformations, and all the superior and inferior forms were 
    thus arranged.</b></p>
  <p><b>Thus we learn that unless the Head (or ruling power, or government) of 
    a nation...be first properly constituted, that nation cannot be properly ruled. 
    For if the Head be first disposed aright, then all things can be ordained; 
    but if that be not first disposed aright, neither can the nation be governed 
    aright.</b></p>

    He was disposed in His conformation, nothing (further) could be ordained.&quot;

  <p><b>To build support for his Kosovo policy, President Bill Clinton has played 
    seemingly every historical-rhetorical card: World War I, World War II, the 
    Cold War, Vietnam--even the struggle against hate crimes and discrimination 
    against gays and lesbians. But Clinton's orgy of analogy only proves, as Alexander 
    Pope wrote nearly three centuries ago, &quot;a little learning is a dangerous 
    thing&quot;--and so drink deep, the poet advised, or drink not at all from 
    the spring of wisdom.</b></p>
  <p><b>Clinton's arguments show that he has learned the contradictory lessons 
    of the last century of statecraft and that he agrees with all of them. The 
    most poignant of these historical references is World War I, which was triggered 
    by an assassination in the Balkan city of Sarajevo, just 100 miles from Kosovo.</b></p>
  <p><b>ONE BY ONE IN THE SUMMER OF 1914, THE GREAT POWERS OF EUROPE WERE PPULLED 
    BY THEIR ALLIANCES INTO THECAULDRON OF CONFLICT...</b></p>
  <p><b>Serbia is no strategic threat to America. But that doesn't mean that Milosovic 
    is completely without retaliatory capacity; it was Serb terror that precipitated 
    World War I and, since enemies tend to have long memories, an act of vengeance 
    <i>(For vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord...</i>Deut.32:35-42; Heb.10:30,31) 
    could come in a year, a decade, or a century.</b></p>
  <p><b>Americans have gotten used to push-button conflicts in which we suffer 
    virtually no casualties. But our power, however well-intentioned and well-aimed, 
    feels far different to those who have been on the receiving end of a cruise

<p><font size="+1">Mikhail Gorbachev presided over the collapse of Communism as 
  an economic philosophy in the West. It was to pave the way for the birth of 
  the true Communal Order--the Kingdom of God. It was also to fulfill the words:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter the congregation 
    of the Lord; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the 
    congregation of the Lord FOR EVER...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 
    23:3).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Who are these who may not enter the congregation of the Lord 
  &quot;for ever?&quot; They are those who shall come out of the caves (the recesses 
  of their own thoughts) trying to induce future generations to return to the 
  political and economic ways of this present age. It is understood in the story 
  of Lot's escape from Sodom. (Genesis 19:24-38), which prefigures the Nation-Church's 
  escape from the consumption of this age as it is written: <i>As it was in the 
  days of Lot... </i>When Lot escaped, he, along with his two daughters, entered 
  a cave. The cave speaks of the place where things are hidden, just as the more 
  worldly members of the congregation will conceal their affection for the things 
  and the ways of this age, even after being delivered into the next. The daughters 
  represent these worldly attachments, and all of those who will attempt to make 
  Lot drink from the cup again. (See 1 Thessalonians 5). They will say:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Our father is old and there is not a man to come into 
    us AFTER THE MANNER OF ALL THE EARTH, come let us make our father drink wine, 
    and we will lie with him, that we may preserve the seed </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(of 
    our old ways)</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The daughters gave birth to two sons named Moab and Ammi. And 
  when they came out of the cave these sons gave birth to two great peoples, the 
  Moabites and the Ammonites. These two represent the &quot;ways of men&quot; 
  <i>After the manner of all the earth</i>. Because Moses led the mind of Israel 
  to edge of Moab before it passed into the Promise (Deut.34; Numbers 22 to 24), 
  we reason that the Moabites ultimately refer to the peoples of the West, and 
  therefore the Ammonites to the people of the East. The two represent every thought-form 
  and earth-born philosophy that are in opposition and contention with each other--which 
  in turn serve to pull the mind of Israel from its historic center. In the 20th 
  century these are the two great world-systems of State Capitalism and State 
  Communism (and all their attendant forms). True spiritual thought is the intended 
  Synthesis in this great Dialectical struggle. Neither philosophy, however, nor 
  any of their adherents, may enter the realm of the kingdom of God...for ever.</font></p>

  <p><b>WASHINGTON__The Russian military's attempt to shape the Kosovo peace settlement 
    through its move into Pristina should not have come as a shock to Western 
    diplomats. It is only the most recent example of a disturbing and pervading 
    trend in Russia: the civilian leadership's inability to control and govern 
    its increasingly fragmented and frustrated military. </b></p>
  <p><b>This action took the West by surprise because policy-makers have grown 
    to expect passivity from the Russian military. The Russian military did not 
    resist the dogmatic political changes in their country, they seemed resigned 
    to huge budget cuts, they did not question the decline in the fighting ability 
    of their divisions, and they accepted the loss of their organization's status. 
    As a result a consensus emerged here and abroad that the Russian army would 
    not pose an immediate political threat to the Yeltsin regime or be an important 
    player in the international arena.</b></p>
  <p><b>What most people failed to realize is that while an internally fragmented 
    and increasingly weak Russian military is unlikely to launch a coup and impose 
    military rule in Russia, it can still undermine the ability of Russian state 
    leaders to carry out state policy, raising questions for us about the viability 
    of Russia's international commitments.</b></p>
  <p><b>Last month, when negotiations over the prospective relationship between 
    Russian peacekeeping forces and NATO command failed to make much headway, 
    Colonel General Ivashov, the head of the Defense Ministry's International 
    Cooperation Department, hinted that Russia might force the hand of the NATO 
    military alliance by negotiating directly with the Serbs and laying claim 
    to their own control sector in Kosovo. The arrival in Pristina of a Russian 
    brigade previously stationed in Bosnia...is clearly a move by the frustrated 
    Russian military that, in the absence of clear signals from leaders in Moscow, 
    it is trying to influence the terms of the peacekeeping agreement, and bolster 
    its country's rapidly diminishing great-power status...</b></p>
  <p><b>The Russian military initiative in Kosovo is just the most recent example 
    of how the failure of civilians to provide the military with clear political 
    leadership has led soldiers to undermine the formulation of an integrated 
    foreign policy. Earlier examples can be found in Russian negotiations with 
    former Soviet Republics over various &quot;hot spots&quot; Abkhazia, Georgia, 
    Tadjikistan, and Moldova. In these instances, Russian military leaders played 
    a key independent role in negotiating cease fires and peace-keeping operations. 
    According to a report in <i>Izvestia</i>...Foreign Minister Kozyrev publicly 
    complained, &quot;wholesale transfer of arms are taking place in Transcaucus 
    and Moldova...Under what agreement is this effected, I would like to ask...? 
    Why are the military deciding the most important issues?&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>The events in Kosovo should act as an early warning signal that civilian 
    leaders in Russia and the West can no longer put Russian military reform on 
    the back burner. It is time that policy-makers in the West review their assumptions 
    about the Russian military and realize that this limping, disintegrating organization 
    has the potential to pose a serious threat both to its own civilian leadership 
    and to the international community. POWER is based on organized force; but 
    when the organized structures of power begin to disintegrate, NEW AND UNEXPECTED 
    FORCES ARE RELEASED WHICH CAN BE EVEN`MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF THEIR SHEER 
    UNPREDICTABILITY. </b></p>

  <p><b>HONG KONG, July 17__President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in Beijing 
    tonight on the first stop of an Asian tour intended to revive his country's 
    faded diplomatic role in the region and build what could become a Chinese-Russian 
    axis to counter American influence.</b></p>
  <p><b>Mr. Putin is expected to sign at least six accords with Chinese leaders 
    on Tuesday, including a joint statement with with President Jiang Zemin condemning 
    American proposals for missile defense systems over North America and Asia. 
    Opposition to the American plan has accelerated a relationship that Russia 
    and China describe as a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; intended to counter 
    American power.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The partnership is an effort to oppose hegemony and supremacy, and 
    one single country dominating the world,&quot; said Zhao Huasheng, director 
    of the Russian Studies department at the Shanghai Institute for International 
    Studies...</b></p>
  <p><b>While it is not yet clear how warmly Mr. Putin will embrace the Chinese 
    worldview, Western analysts say the rapproachement between the countries is 
    taking on an increasingly anti-American cast.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;On one level, this is classic real-politik balance of power, but 
    on another it has the appearance of a united front against the United States,&quot; 
    said David Shambaugh, a China specialist at George Washington University and 
    the Brookings Institute in Washington. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
