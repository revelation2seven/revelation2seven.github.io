<blockquote>&nbsp; </blockquote>
<div align="center"></div>
<p><font size="+1">In 1917 Woodrow Wilson proclaimed a crusade in the name of 
  Christ &quot;to save Democracy,&quot; and the religious institutions of the 
  West fell down and worshipped. (The ways of the Spirit, of course, transcend 
  the very idea of democracy itself. They are bold in the face of injustice, but 
  utterly submissive in the presence of righteousness and justice). Those, however, 
  who would not bow down at that time were branded enemies, not simply of the 
  state but of this holy cause:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Baha'is, a religious 
    sect founded by a Persian mystic, believed that Isaiah of the Bible was talking 
    about President Woodrow Wilson when he prophesied: 'For unto us a child is 
    born, unto us a son is given, and his name shall be called...the Prince of 
    Peace'... The war meant something almost as dramatic to many who took themselves 
    to be ordinary Christians. This has been 'Christ's war,' commented the Los 
    Angeles Times. 'Christ on one side, and all that stood opposed to Christ on 
    the other side,'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At seven in the morning...factory 
    whistles blew and church bells rang in every hamlet and city in the country. 
    State officials sat expectantly at long tables ready to hand out green draft 
    cards to anyone who lined up to register his name, address and age. This was 
    the test day, the moment of truth for the government's war policy...By noon 
    apprehension among the state officials turned to rejoicing. The young men 
    of the country were indeed turning out...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was little trouble anywhere, 
    and it was easily put down wherever it occurred. The newspapers reported that 
    in Racine, Wisconsin: John Robush, employed at the J.I. Case Tin Company was 
    forced to kiss the American flag by 300 of his fellow employees after he declared 
    that he would not register and would not fight for the United States. The 
    man was made to crawl on his knees to the flag which had been spread upon 
    the floor and after kissing it compelled to salute.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Flagstaff, Arizona Navaho Indians 
    drove an Indian agent and other Federal officers off the government reservation...The 
    Federal officers were afraid the Indians would go on the warpath if further 
    attempts were made to register them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time Ute Indians of 
    Colorado refused to register under the Selective Service Act and spent most 
    of the day dancing war and 'bear' dances in native costumes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other parts of the country, 
    scattered groups of conscientious objectors who refused to register for the 
    draft were quietly put in jail...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Wilson's urging, the United 
    States...passed a law that threatened a 20-year jail sentence to anyone who 
    'shall willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, 
    or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces of the United States...Thousands 
    of people were sent to jail for their antiwar speeches and writings, and thousands 
    more were frightened into silence.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the Reverend Clarance Waldron 
    told his Vermont Bible class that 'a Christian can take no part in the war,' 
    he was sentenced to 15 years in the Atlanta penitentiary.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The day before Wilson was expected 
    to deliver his message to congress, the Reverend John Haynes Holmes, the pacifist 
    minister of a church in New York, stood in the pulpit and told a stunned congregation:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'War is an open violation of Christianity. 
    If war is right then Christianity is wrong, false, a lie. If Christianity 
    is right then war is wrong, false, a lie...When or if the system of conscription 
    is adopted, I shall have to decline to serve. If this means a fine, I will 
    pay my fine. If this means persecution, I will carry my cross. No order of 
    President, no law of nation or state, no loss of reputation, freedom or life, 
    will persuade me or force me to this business of killing.&quot;...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Such stories of true spiritual conviction, bravery and self-sacrifice 
  go on and on, from the First World War to the present. They can and will fill 
  volumes. Pacifists, religious and non-religious alike, stood side by side in 
  a cause that was not only unpopular but dangerous to uphold. One young man named 
  Ernest Meyer wrote from his prison cell:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'I wish that we war objectors were 
    not the miserable handful that we are, but a clamoring host, so that word 
    of our existence would travel on the wind to all corners, and men everywhere 
    would spike their guns and refuse longer to serve the warrior-imperialists 
    who have betrayed them. We are so few now. But late, in the next war--for 
    more will come, be sure of it--our ranks may be formidable...our folded arms 
    all powerful.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For one fleeting moment, Ernest 
    Meyer forgot about his loneliness and boredom as he contemplated a distant 
    future when thousands of young idealists like himself would act as he believed 
    real patriots should act and refuse to bear arms.&quot; </font>Hooray For 
    Peace, Hooray For War, by Steven Jantzen<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">There is (was) an active church in Greenwhich Village in New 
  York City which states as its present declaration of faith:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We declare ourselves to be a people 
    of faith; a people who claim God's creative rule in our lives above and beyond 
    the power of governments and social categories.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We believe that the will of God 
    is Life, and as one people we choose joyfully to embrace Life as holy and 
    sacred.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We reject weapons as murderous 
    protection which takes food and substance from our brothers and sisters...sisters 
    and brothers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We renounce violence, both personal 
    and institutional as contrary to our struggle to be faithful Christians.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Together we lift up our vision 
    of God's Shalom as our only true security. And with Jesus our Christ, we stand 
    in solidarity with the poor, the oppressed, the forgotten children of Creation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With our arms linked together in 
    love and hope, we confess our faith and declare that the Spirit of God is 
    upon us because God has appointed us to preach good news to the poor. God 
    has sent us proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the 
    blind; to set at liberty those who are oppressed; to proclaim the Acceptable 
    Year of the Lord. Amen and so be it...</font>(Amen and so be it)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In the great men of every age, from ancient times to the present--from 
  George Washington to George Bush--we find that image from which the people have 
  been warned to flee: <i>Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thin eyelids. 
  DELIVER THYSELF AS A ROE FROM THE HAND OF THE HUNTER, and as a bird from the 
  hand of the fowler. </i>(Proverbs 6:4,5). From whom? From NIMROD: <i>And Cush 
  begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter 
  before the Lord. Wherefore it is said, Evan</i> <i>AS NIMROD</i> <i>the mighty 
  hunter before the Lord. </i>(Genesis 10:8,9). These great ones are AS NIMROD. 
  They hunt the souls of men.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Jimmy Carter teaches ethics, and turns his hand at helping 
  the poor, and the liberal side of the church bows down. They forget the words: 
  <i>But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. </i>(Proverbs 12:10). And 
  then Ronald Reagan mentioned God on his way to the White House and the conservative 
  side of the church fell to its knees. What must be done with the words that 
  say: <i>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that friendship with the 
  world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world 
  is an enemy of God. </i>(James 4:4). The President can call for an assembly 
  of church leaders, and they will come. And they will spread his sayings across 
  the breadth of the land. One young woman asked several years ago: &quot;Well 
  what if someone like Jesse Jackson was elected President? The simple answer 
  is, then Jesse Jackson will be the antichrist, for it is the office, and the 
  pursuit of it, that corrupts the heart. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So why was the West so confounded by the events of the Russian 
  Revolution of 1917, and the rising specter of Soviet Power in the world? Didn't 
  it fall right on the heels of Woodrow Wilson's declaration of war against the 
  Holy Land? Isn't it written: <i>And when he opened the Second seal...there went 
  out another horse that was Red: and POWER was given to him that sat thereon 
  to take peace from the earth, and that they shall kill one another: and there 
  was given unto him </i></font><font size="+1"><i><a href="../UsedImages/pg178print.gif">a 
  Great Sword</a>. </i>(Revelation 6:3,4; Isaiah 63). Neither should we be confounded 
  by the present state of disorder in Russian society. Chaos is the substance 
  from which order is created--great order. (See Genesis 1:3,4)...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>THE FIRE CAME BY </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
    fact is indisputable. Something happened in Siberia nearly 70 years ago that 
    was unprecedented--an explosion unlike any the earth had ever experienced. 
    But as the first expeditions made their way to the inhospitable area, the 
    mystery only deepened. The event remains today one of the most intriguing 
    and baffling of scientific puzzles.</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">HIGH ABOVE the Indian Ocean, a 
    huge object hurtling from space pierces the earth's atmospheric shell. In 
    a long, sloping trajectory, it rockets north across the Asian mainland. Drawn 
    lower by gravity, it hits thicker strata of atmosphere, and intense frictional 
    heat builds up.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the dawn of June 30, 1908, 
    caravans winding through the Gobi Desert of western China halt and look in 
    awe at the Fireball blazing across the sky. It disappears over the border 
    of Mongolia. Plunging into the denser air layers, it glows with the heat of 
    5000 degrees F.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In remote and sparsely populated 
    central Russia, a deafening roar terrifies the inhabitants of the few small 
    settlements. Then, at 7:17 a.m., the central Siberian plateau near the Stony 
    Tunguska River--a desolate subarctic region of peat bogs and pine forests--shudders 
    under the impact of cataclysmic explosion. So violent is the detonation that 
    the seismographic center at Irkutsk, some 550 miles to the south, registers 
    tremors of earthquake proportions. Seismographs are also activated in St. 
    Petersburg (2200 miles west), Jena, Germany (3240 miles), even as far away 
    as Washington, D.C. and Java.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Instantly, a gigantic &quot;pillar 
    of fire&quot; flares up to such height it is visible above the horizon to 
    startled Siberian towns several hundred miles away. Then the air is racked 
    by a series of thunderous claps heard for more than 550 miles. Simultaneously 
    with the blinding column of fire in the sky, a searing thermal current sweeps 
    across the hilly taiga (northern woods), scorching the tall conifers, igniting 
    fires that will burn for days...</font><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">While breaking these bounds established by Moses (as the children 
  of Israel are preparing to again), by sending the young men of America up into 
  the mount to make war against God, Woodrow Wilson was also setting up the Image 
  of Greatness, as it is also written: <i>A crown was given unto him: and he went 
  forth conquering and to conquer. </i>No matter what men thought of it the Image 
  was great. He set it up Sixty cubits high, and Six cubits wide. (Daniel 3:1). 
  Six is not only a number associated with the earth, and with the unperfected 
  spirit in man, but it is also, as we have already seen, the number connected 
  to the place named Beauty on the Tree of Life--the City of Jerusalem hidden 
  in the center of the Earth. Wilson concerned himself in matters that far exceeded 
  his comprehension when he involved himself and the American nation in those 
  affairs that surrounded the city of Vienna:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel, thus saith 
    the Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the Foundation of 
    the earth, and formeth the spirit in man within him. Behold, I will make Jerusalem 
    a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in 
    the siege both against Judah and Jerusalem. </font></i><font size="+1"><i>AND 
    IN THAT DAY I WILL MAKE JERUSALEM A BURDENSOME STONE FOR ALL PEOPLE: ALL THAT 
    BURDEN THEMSELVES WITH IT SHALL BE CUT IN PIECES</i>,</font><i><font size="+1"> 
    though the people of the earth be gathered against it...</font></i><font size="+1">(Zechariah 
    12:1,2). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><b><img src="../UsedImages/pg503.gif" width="540" height="733"></b></p>
<p><font size="+1">After Wilson, Warren Harding set himself up to rule. Because 
  these men possess equal visions of their own greatness the Image now increases 
  to the height of 120 cubits. <i>The Tree grew, and was strong.</i> (Daniel 4:11). 
  It is still only Six cubits wide...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There is another facet to this mystery that we should explore 
  before continuing, one which we shall discover at length in the chapter on the 
  Mysteries of Islam. Let us take an aside, and touch on it here as briefly as 
  we can, through a work of some recent consequence among conservatively-minded 
  Christians entitled <i>The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow. </i>This book was 
  a reaction to the premise of <i>An Aquarian Conspiracy, </i>which was the title 
  of a work by Marilyn Furguson. It does, after the higher precepts of reality 
  are sorted out from the doctrines and (patriotic) beliefs (the apprehensions 
  and fears) of the American church, alert us to the fact that Humanism is in 
  itself another religion, one that is opposed in many essential ways to the Judaeo-Christian 
  tradition. So we do not agree with Humanism's every point of view. But neither 
  are we estranged from the highest aspirations of the Humanist agenda. In fact 
  one cannot attain to spiritual perfection until they have espoused the same 
  yearning for peace and justice in the world, for universal citizenship, and 
  for the dawning of a New Age in which these things shall be possible, as do 
  the sincerest of Humanists. However:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Humanism's view of man as 
    the measure of all things implies that there is nothing above man and the 
    order of nature which he is a part. It rules out the supernatural, not only 
    as an explanation of the universe but as part of reality. Only the natural 
    is real. The personal God of the Bible is seen as a product of the human imagination 
    and reflects man's early need to find an explanation for what he did not understand.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After man, for instance, discovered 
    the scientific reasons for thunder and lightning, he no longer needed a 'god' 
    to account for them.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As man learns more and more about 
    the universe, he has less and less need for supernatural explanations. However 
    tolerant Humanism may be toward contemporary faith, it is basically an atheistic 
    philosophy. And if God is simply a convenient way to explain the unexplained, 
    says the humanist, we may be sure that human knowledge will at last expose 
    him as a fraud. Man will be able to stand on his own, unaided by the crutch 
    of religion.&quot; </font>Isms On the Prowl, p.25<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">So the children of Israel must always depart from Humanism 
  on these grounds--especially when discussing what form of government each would 
  ultimately consent to. Because if it is not established according to the (Higher, 
  Universal) precepts of the Law and the Prophets, it must remain foreign to the 
  Nation-church, which must in turn continue on as a stranger and a pilgrim in 
  the midst of it. Nevertheless, we do not totally divorce ourselves from these 
  several excerpts expressed by the author of <i>The Aquarian Conspiracy</i>:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Once we understand Nature's 
    transformative powers we see that it is our powerful ally, and not a force 
    to be feared or subdued.&quot; p.25.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Aquarian Conspiracy represents 
    the 'Now What.' We have to move into the unknown, the known has failed us 
    completely.&quot; p.26.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Usually at the point of crisis, 
    someone has a great heretical idea, a powerful new insight explains the apparent 
    contradictions.&quot; p.27.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We stand at the brink of 
    a new age. An age of an open world, a time of renewal when a fresh release 
    of the Spirit may unleash new possibilities. The sum of all our days is just 
    our beginning.&quot; p.42.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When the puzzles and paradoxes 
    cry out for a resolution, a new paradigm (a new way of perceiving the world) 
    is due.&quot; p.162.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Western culture was desperately 
    searching for its center, for some balance between the inner and outer life...The 
    inner world of the whole age...is trying to compensate for some failure in 
    consciousness, to restore a balance destroyed by one-sidedness, to reconcile 
    the glaring opposites.&quot; p.54.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Then came out of that extreme 
    and absolute division, a sudden unity. A new kind of Consciousness was created 
    in them. Mind and heart, which had been irreconcilable enemies, became united 
    in the soul, which loved what it knew. The inward division was healed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Murray called this new-knowing 
    the Soul. Over the centuries, accounts of transcendental experience often 
    described it as a mysterious center, the penetration of some unknown but central 
    realm. This transcendent center is the lore of all cultures, represented in 
    mandalas, in alchemy, in the king's chambers in pyramids, the sanctum sanctorum, 
    the Holy of Holies. 'We sit in a ring and suppose,' said Robert Frost, 'but 
    the secret sits in the middle and knows.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The power of the True Center must 
    be the most frequently mislaid artifact of human wisdom. It is as if the same 
    message keeps washing ashore and no one breaks the bottles, much less the 
    code.&quot; p.81.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The political system needs 
    to be transformed, not reformed...We need something else, not something more.&quot; 
    p.191.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And then Furguson fails us, as do all Humanists, when she urges 
  us to create in ourselves what God is already creating: &quot;What we have called 
  God is the evolutionary drive of consciousness in the universe. The new earth 
  earth exists only in the heart of men.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Then the author of the <i>Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow </i>fails 
  us in much the same way. In a reaction to this &quot;conspiracy&quot; of secular 
  humanists to usher in a new age (which is, by the way, exactly what God is doing), 
  the author herds into the common lot all who reject the prevailing mythology 
  of American Evangelicals--which makes of America a Christian nation, and Humanism 
  a threat to the essential Christian character of this Christian nation. She 
  has failed to realize that the United States was founded, not by Christ-conscious 
  individuals, but by Humanists for Humanists, and, through her own neglect of 
  the Law, that the Nation-church was commanded to be a stranger in the midst 
  of it--and more specifically as this age draws to its conclusion. She fails 
  to see that the most powerful cult in America today is the Nation-cult of America 
  itself. It is the cult and the worship of Ba'al. When America's founding fathers 
  spoke of the separation of church and state they also meant: &quot;Let God tend 
  to his business, and we will tend to our's.&quot; (Although we are glad that 
  this clause was enacted into the law of the land, for had we lived at the time 
  of the Revolution we would not have wanted anyone else's &quot;christian&quot; 
  values governing us either. It was all apostasy, 1 Peter 2). But when the true 
  Nation-church speaks of separation of church and state it means: &quot;O Lord 
  draw close to us.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The real hidden danger lies in the failure of the American 
  church to perceive in its own agenda for a new, or born-again America, and in 
  its own champion, the President (particularly during the Reagan years...and 
  now even more particularly), the very fulfillment of its own fears. His vision 
  for the future of America--his chosen and elect nation--is such as can apply 
  to God's Israel alone, and none other; and the extremes to which he would go 
  to fulfill that vision--the death of millions--puts him more than any other 
  person on earth in direct and dark opposition to the True Shepherd who <i>leads 
  the flock by still waters</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The real Hidden Danger of the Rainbow can be seen on the cover 
  of Mike Evan's <i>Jerusalem D.C.</i>, another in the ever-growing, and ever-confused, 
  library of works that are dear to American evangelicals. How is it written: 
  <i>Woe to them who write the book with their own hands, and then say, This is 
  from God, to traffick with it for a miserable price...Woe to them for what their 
  hands do write. </i>(Sura II.79-81)...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">If brother Evans will accept the ribbing, we are reminded of 
  Dorothy's scarecrow, who, when asked the way to the Great City, pointed one 
  way and then the other, saying, &quot;This way, no this way,&quot; and then 
  pointing both ways. In the opening chapter, entitled &quot;A Demonic Conspiracy&quot; 
  he says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;THE ROOM WAS FILLED WITH 
    THE MOST POWERFUL EVANGELICAL AND JEWISH LEADERS IN THE NATION. I was sitting 
    in the White House listening to the President's envoy to the Middle East explain 
    the status of Jerusalem and that it must be negotiated with the Moslem world. 
    The United States does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I rose to my feet and interrupted, 
    'Excuse me!'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The spokesman looked at me and 
    said nothing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(I said), 'The Word of God recognizes 
    Jerusalem as Israel's capital. God himself does not recognize your non-recognition. 
    And furthermore, the Bible is non-negotiable.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As I interviewed the Chief Rabbi 
    of Jerusalem on the subject of Jerusalem's being Israel's Holy City, he said 
    to me, 'Mr. Evans, why have you entitled your book JERUSALEM DC?' HE THOUGHT 
    POSSIBLY I WAS ASSUMING SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND JERUSALEM. 
    I smiled and said, 'No, Jerusalem does not need to be tied to Washington to 
    receive recognition and approval. D.C. stands for David's Capital, and for 
    the fact that 3,000 years ago God Almighty proclaimed Jerusalem as the capital 
    of Israel, and for the fact that the Messiah himself will stand in the Holy 
    City of Jerusalem to rule and reign.' And that is an undeniable fact...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The most critical defect in Evan's discourse is the fact that 
  there <i>IS</i> an historic and cosmic connection between Jerusalem and America, 
  and in the fact that Zion (David's City) is temporarily situated here in the 
  West, as it is written: <i>For Messiah is the end of the law for righteousness 
  to everyone that believeth. </i>(Rom.10:1-4; Hebrews 12:18-29). The author continues:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Jerusalem is more than that. 
    Ultimately it is the peculiar emblem of the One true God of the universe, 
    and his claim on this planet. That claim has, since the dawn of time, been 
    challenged by the prince off demons himself. Through deception and sin Satan 
    has staked a claim on the earth and all its kingdoms--a claim that he clings 
    to tenaciously...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The story of Jerusalem...shows 
    that Satan has hurled two darts in particular at the city--and what it stands 
    for. Today both of these darts are being hurled at it simultaneously in Satan's 
    final desperate effort to thwart the coming of the kingdom of God. Those darts 
    are Islam and Humanism.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me explain...I'll explain the 
    beginnings of Islam in more details later </font>(say!)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...but 
    now I want to focus on one critical aspect of those origins: the appearance 
    of the angel Gabriel </font>(the Angel of the East)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    to Mohammad. Mohammad had been meditating alone in a cave on Mount Hira, and 
    a vision appeared to him. That vision was a Lying Spirit that gained entrance 
    into Mohammad's life at that juncture, for it was after that he began to develop 
    and proclaim the peculiar tenets that have come to be known as Islam...That 
    spirit compounded the curse that had fallen on Ishmael many centuries before:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>A wild ass of a man will he be, against every man, and every man against 
      him, setting himself to defy all his brethren.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The descendants of Ishmael are 
    the Arabs and these words from Genesis catch the peculiarity of their nature 
    in an uncanny way. But once that lying spirit convinced Mohammad of a different 
    gospel, a second curse was added to the one already hung around the neck of 
    Ishmael and his descendants. And this was the anathema or curse of Paul:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other 
      than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally damned...</i>(Galatians 
      1:18)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>

  the interest of our growing sense of the many dimensions of the Mystery of God. 
  Just as they (the mysteries) were sown into the fabric of the Written Word in 
  the East, only to reappear in the West, so the Camel of Islam has also passed 
  through the Eye of the Needle. The descendants of this &quot;cursed&quot; Ishmael 
  are to be found not only in the East but in their fullest spiritual sense right

    of God. The majority take this Night Journey literally, but allow that there 
    were occasions on which a Spiritual Journey of Vision occurred. Even on the 
    supposition of a miraculous bodily journey it is conceded that the Body was 
    almost transformed into spiritual fineness. The Hadith literature gives details 
    of the Journey and its study helps to elucidate its mystic meanings. The Holy 
    Prophet was first transported to the seat of the earlier revelations in Jerusalem, 
    and then taken through the Seventh Heaven even to the Sublime Throne </font>(The 
    Merkabah)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, and initiated into the 
    spiritual mysteries of the human soul struggling in Space and in Time.&quot;</font></p>

  also says: &quot;God's knowledge comprehends all things.&quot;</font></p>

  <p>President Truman and I discussed whether or not we were obligated to inform 
    Stalin that we had succeeded in developing a powerful weapon and shortly would 
    drop a bomb in Japan. Though there was an understanding that the Soviets would 
    enter the war with Japan three months after Germany surrendered, which would 
    make their entrance about the middle of August...the president and i hoped 
    that Japan would surrender before then. However...we agreed that because this 
    was uncertain, and because the Soviets might soon be our allies in that war, 
    the President should inform Stalin of our intentions, but do so ina casual 
    way.</p>
  <p>Upon the adjournment of the afternoon session, when we arose from the table, 
    the President, accompanied by our interpreter...walked around to Stalin's 
    chair and said, &quot;You may be interested to know that we have developed 
    a new and powerful weapon and within a few days intend to use it against Japan.&quot; 
    I watched Stalin's expression as this was being interpreted, and was surprised 
    that he smiled blandly and said only a few words. When the President and I 
    reached our car, he said that Stalin had replied only, &quot;THAT'S FINE. 
    I HOPE YOU MAKE GOOD USE OF IT AGAINST THE JAPANESE.&quot;</p>
  <p>I did not believe Stalin grasped the full importance of the President's statement, 
    and thought that on the next day there would be some inquiry about this &quot;new 
    and powerful weapon,&quot; but I was mistaken. I thought then and even now

<p><font size="+1">In the summer of 1979 Jimmy Carter went to Vienna to sign the 
  Salt II Treaty with the Soviet Union. This pact of mutual belligerence was signed 
  on top of the ancient salt mines of Judaea, whose salt was used to seal the 
  ancient covenant (see Numbers 18:19), thus the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">For every one shall be salted with Fire, and every sacrifice

<p><font size="+1">It is also written that...<i>When they begin to say Peace and 
  Safety </i>(which Carter and other Western leaders have been trying to both 
  negotiate and enforce ever since)<i>, the end would come. </i>(1 Thess. 5:1-9). 
  Leonid Zamyatin wrote in <i>Newsweek</i>: &quot;A scene I observed during the 
  meeting of the two presidents in Vienna last June etched itself in my memory. 
  After the official ceremony was over, a woman came up to the table and blessed 
  with a cross that truly historic document. Later she said, 'Please God that 
  everything written in this treaty is translated into life.'&quot; Amen!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The fifth chapter of Daniel tells us that God began to judge 
  Babylon in the Sixty-second year of Darius the Mede. In 1979 the Soviet Union 
  (the Medes) were in their Sixty-second year. (And so began the series of events 
  that have brought the world to its present crisis). This same chapter says that 
  at that time the king of Babylon and all his court were <i>Drinking wine out 
  of the vessels of the Lord, while they praised the gods of silver, and gold, 
  of brass, iron, wood, and stone</i>. This refers to all in our time who imagine 
  they can worship the God of Heaven (through the Mystery of Christ) and the gods 
  of the nations at the same time, as it is also written: <i>Ye cannot drink the 
  cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye canot be partakers of the Lord's 
  table, and the table of devils...DO WE PROVOKE THE LORD TO JEALOUSY? ARE WE 
  STRONGER THAN HE? </i>(1 Corinthians 10:20-22).</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Word began to unfold at this time, and all the events that 
  have led to the present and impending world crisis were set in motion. The Iranians 
  (one of the nations of lesser Persia--the whole of Asia is the Greater Persia), 
  stormed the American embassy, and the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. The judgments 
  that will conclude with the coming of the kingdom of God had begun.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Can a nation that falls down Five times daily be any other 
  than one which is fulfilling the absolute will of God? Is that form of religion 
  which makes war and captures other living beings free? Free to act otherwise? 
  Of course not. It is in absolute submission to God, performing God's terrible 
  will without understanding or question. (Deut.32:39-42; Dan.12:7; Rev.10:5,6). 
  Such a nation, and such a religion, however, is a direct reflection of those 
  in the West who, though imagining themselves free, are under the same cosmic 
  spell. Thus the &quot;Twelvers&quot; appeared together. Carter and Khomeini 
  were spiritual images of each other. (One, of course, had to possess the eyes 
  of the Spirit to see it). Both were (and are) performing God's historic will 
  in the earth. The plight of the hostages in Iran (as well as the people of Iran 
  themselves), was and is identical to that of the Church in America. One group 
  is held in bondage and mesmerized by Divine force, the other by an even Darker 
  , more subtle spirit--by the <i>illusions</i> of freedom, by the allure of mammon, 
  by the powerful deceptions of the lower, material world, which in the end lead 
  to further bondage and eventual destruction...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">&quot;Free U.S. Hostages,&quot; the headlines read. &quot;In 
  an order that came down firmly on the U.S. side, the 15 Justices of the World 
  Court unanimously told Iran to provide all diplomatic personnel with the full 
  protection, privileges, and immunities guaranteed under international law, and 
  NOT to put the hostages on trial.&quot; The American government concurred. Let 
  the same pertain to every one of God's children here in the West as they seek 
  in these times to get themselves up out of the American state of mind to which 
  they have been in bondage, and especially to all those who refuse to participate 
  in the final judgment wars that God is preparing to wage upon the Western world, 
  and even worse yet, that the Western world is preparing to wage against God.</font></p>

    invite the souls of the unruly to calmness BY THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS CHRIST.&quot; 
    With this greeting in mind, we as fellow clergy must speak out about THE INCONSISTENCIES 
    BETWEEN YOUR SPOKEN WORDS AND YOUR ACTIONS. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Less than a year ago you preached 
    justice, equality, peace, mercy and compassion...you spoke of &quot;your hopes

    people.&quot;...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">DURING ALL THIS TIME YOU CLAIMED 
    TO BE A HOLY TEACHER, A MAN OF JUSTICE. FORGIVENESS, AND RECONCILIATION. This 
    image was further brought to the American people at your Paris meeting with 
    the former U.S. Attorney General Ramsay Clark who called you A MAN OF PEACE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we read your letter...the clear 
    image of an egomaniac begins to emerge. It is not the image of a holy man, 
    nor that of a religious leader, nor that of a Man of Peace, and not that of 
    a Reconciliator, but rather it is a picture of a man of hate and vengeance, 
    hiding under clerical robes.</font></p>

    innocent Americans you hold hostage on Sovereign American soil, and even though

    Merciful, the Compassionate, yet you kill without mercy and threaten to kill 
    without compassion <i>innocent</i> Americans...YOU SPEAK OF PEACE AND JUSTICE, 
    yet ravage the soul and the heart. You have brought sorrow and despair to 
    all Americans, especially those who have relatives bound, blindfolded, and

    eyes, we in the Christian world have a last chance to redeem ourselves by 
    agreeing to your ideas, by condoning your firing squads, turning over the 
    Shah, and by turning a blind eye and a deaf ear on the Americans being held 
    hostage in Iran.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Through the reading of your entire

<p><font size="+1">There is not one charge here that the American government, 
  its leaders and its peoples are not guilty of, not only in the spiritual sense 
  but in the plainly political and historical sense: The charge can be made against 
  the &quot;sons of Liberty&quot; on behalf of all those who were persecuted for 
  refusing to participate in the American Revolution, or who were forced against 
  their own conscience to join the colonists in their rebellion against <i>THE 
  CROWN</i>; on behalf the Indigenous Peoples of this land who were murdered and 
  forcibly removed to other lands, and placed in concentration camps (reservations) 
  to this very day; on behalf of every African man and woman who was brought here 
  in chains and subjected to abuses beyond description before they were finally 
  &quot;freed&quot; (at the cost of one million lives) into the hands of Capitalist 
  overlords who were, and still are, just as ruthless (when they need to be) as 
  any slaveholder in the past; and on behalf of every young man who is still left 
  to stand idle on the streetcorners of this land without meaningful and rewarding 
  employment; and on behalf of the many thousands upon thousands of others here 
  and abroad who have stood up in one way or another against American, and American-financed 
  injustices. (It is all documented, and it has all been performed either directly 
  or indirectly in the name of Christ). The leaders of America think that this 
  is all water under the bridge, but God, who has not lost sight of the least 
  sparrow, has not forgotten the least instance of injustice and oppression that 
  has been accomplished in Their Name, and has been rising to the occasion of 
  judgment ever since. Thus the words: <i>He that leadeth into captivity shall 
  go into captivity: He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. 
  Here is the patience and faith of the saints. </i>(Revelation 13:10). In 1979

  Me-ne. </i></font></p>
