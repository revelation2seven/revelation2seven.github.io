  </blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">I should have mentioned at the beginning of this Introduction 
  that I have employed the King James Version of the scriptures almost exclusively 
  throughout. But this is a fitting place to say so. The reason has everything 
  to do with the number FORTY and SIX itself (John 2:20), and the relationship 
  this number has to the cosmic dimensions of the True Temple (whose curtains 
  extend all the way across the sea, to the ends of the earth and this fulness 
  of times--to America). And thus it has to do with the relationship these things 
  have with the history of England and evolution of both the English alphabet 
  and the English language--the <i>unknown tongue</i>. (This is not an extension 
  of the Anglo-Israel doctrine which confuses the spiritual Nation--the Israel 
  of God--with the British and American nations. The one is Light, the others 
  are Darkness...Great Darkness). Concerning the English language, however, the 
  oral traditions that found their way into the Torah in the time of Moses, passed 
  out of the ancient Atlantean, Indo-European dialects and into their first written 
  forms using a system of Proto-Hebrew-Phoenician letters and words. (The letters 
  were 22 in number, lending both their number and arrangement to the square-block 
  Hebrew/Chaldean <i>alephbet</i> that was devised centuries later in Judaism's 
  earliest attempts to place a fence (or a hedge) around the Torah, to conceal 
  the sacred <i>Letter </i>of the Law from the world at large. Because the first 
  texts of the Torah were wholly Kabbalistic in their construction, we do not 
  immediately recognize it as originating from an Indo-European, and specifically 
  an ancient priestly<i> </i>Central European, <i>Gaelic</i> dialect)...</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b>Out of the 22 letters of the Atlantean, Proto-Hebrew 
      Phoenician alphabet, the Torah passed into the Greek (the Septuagint) and 
      Latin, and finally to the 26 letters of the English alphabet.</b> </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> Thus the final act of this divine drama opens in the English 
  language, a language that did not even exist in the time of Moses, nor in the 
  time of Christ (understand Isaiah 28:11), but more specifically, in that form 
  of the language that emerged, not only in the time of Shakespear but through 
  the minds of those who spoke and wrote in the manner of Shakespeare (or perhaps 
  even under the name of Shakespeare). This is the language of the King James 
  Version of the Bible. And it is this version of the scriptures alone (with its 
  singularly-inspired structure, word-form, rhythm, meter, and syntax) that the 
  books of the prophets may be opened in our time.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Opening the text we, first of all, can understand why the fourteen 
  books of the Apocrypha, which are still included in the Vulgate (Latin) version 
  of the scriptures, were translated but then set aside out of the main canon 
  of the King James Version, for in doing so the Psalms of David were set directly 
  in the middle of the Book. The prophetic significance can not be over stated 
  in light of the revelation that the City of David itself (the City Above, the 
  Mother of us all--as we shall discover in the following chapters), was also 
  hidden from the eyes of history, not only in the center of the Oracle but in 
  the center of Europe...</font></p>

  110:1-4).</b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">When the King James Version is opened, from the 
  first chapter in Genesis to the final chapter in the Revelation, the 118th Psalm 
  lies not only between the shortest and the longest chapters in the Bible but 
  is itself the middle chapter of the entire Book, and thus the words:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into 
    them, and I will praise the Lord:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become 
    my salvation.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Stone which the builders rejected is become the Head 
    Stone of the corner.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes...</font></i><font size="+1">(Psalm 
    118:19-23; Isaiah 28:16,17; 1 Peter 2:1-8).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The temple of God was FORTY and SIX years in building (John 
  2:20). Thus the words: <i>Let us create Man (ADAM) in our image</i>. (Genesis 
  1:26; Gen.5:1,2). In the English language the word A.D.A.M. equals 46 (1+4+1+40). 
  ADAM, the perfected <i>man</i> (male and female joined together in perfect balance, 
  and in perfect recognition of each other), is the <i>only</i> temple God has 
  ever been, or will ever be, pleased to dwell in. All others have been destroyed...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Every description of the true temple, and of its dimensions 
  in the books of Exodus and Hebrews, speaks of this relationship between the 
  Universal World Tree, the Universal or Archetypal Man who appears upon its cosmic 
  limbs (in whose image our own human bodies are formed), and the Universal Temple. 
  Each is a direct reflection of the other. And in quantum, or spiritual measure, 
  each reveals the nature of God in man, and man in God. The King James version 
  of the bible however...</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;John Dee was instrumental 
    is disseminating Vitruvian principles of architecture and geometry. In 1570, 
    moreover, fifteen years before his journey to Prague, he published a preface 
    to an English translation of Euclid. In this preface, he extolled the 'supremacy 
    of architecture among the mathematical sciences.' He spoke of Christ as 'our 
    Heavenly Archemaster.' He echoed Vitruvius's portrait of the architect as 
    a species of magus.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'And the name of Architecture, 
      is of the principalitie, which this Science hath, above all other Artes. 
      And Plato affirmeth, the Architect to be Master over all, that make any 
      worke...'</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During most of Dee's lifetime, 
    'esoteric' thought in England had, as we have seen, remained underground or 
    had been taken up in certain rarefied circles. In Scotland it had flourished; 
    but because of the House of De Guise and Mary Queen of Scots </font>(Catholics)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    everything Scottish was suspect in English eyes. In consequence, Dee and other 
    English adherents of 'esoterica' could not yet forge the crucial link with 
    developments in Scotland.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the beginning of the seventeenth 
    century, however, the situation had dramatically changed. In 1588, Philip 
    II's Armada had been decisively defeated and Spain was seen as less and less 
    of a threat to English security. The possibility of (Catholicism) (re)establishing 
    a foothold in Britain had receded with the execution of Mary Queen of Scots...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, 'esoteric' thought was 
    no longer associated so exclusively with the houses of Guise and Lorraine, 
    or even, for that matter with Catholic interests. One of its most important 
    new patrons was the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II, who declared himself neither 
    Catholic nor Protestant, but Christian...By 1600, in fact, 'esoteric' thought 
    had begun to flourish energetically and publicly in Protestant principalities 
    throughout Europe...Thus purged of any taint of the Guise and Lorraine families, 
    it could safely break surface in England.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1603...James VI of Scotland--a 
    Stuart monarch with Guise-Lorraine blood--became James I of England. At this 
    point, from the perspective of posterity, one can virtually hear a 'click' 
    as the requisite historical componants at last slip into place. With the union 
    of England and Scotland under a single sovereign, noble Scottish families 
    began to play a role in English affairs...Through such families, something 
    of the old Templar mystique...began to seep into England and Ireland. And 
    the new king, it must be remembered, was a patron and possibly a member of 
    the guilds of 'operative' stonemasons. He brought with him from the north 
    their traditions, as well as the 'esoteric' heritage of his Guise-Lorraine 
    forebears. All of these elements, conjoined with the work of John Dee and 
    his disciples, were to coalesce into a philosophical or, as it is called, 
    'speculative' Freemasonry. All of them had now become not only respectable 
    and legitimate, but associated with the throne as well. The old Templar sword, 
    and the trowel of the master-builder were to become, in effect, adjuncts of 
    the Stuart arms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was to be one further current 
    of influences before Freemasonry crystallised into its modern form. In the 
    Continent...'esoteric' teaching was now being promoted by Protestant princes...and 
    was being used as an instrument of propaganda against the twin bastions of 
    Catholicism, the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. It had now begun to call 
    itself 'Rosicrucianism,' and Frances Yates has labled this phase of its dissemination 
    'the Rosicrucian Enlightenment.' Anonymous pamphlets began to appear, extolling 
    an 'Invisible College' or clandestine confraternity allegedly derived from 
    a mythical founder, Christian Rosenkreuz. These pamphlets militantly attacked 
    the new Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope; they extolled the spectrum of 'esoteric' 
    teaching; they forecast the imminent advent of a new Golden Age...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In England, the chief exponant 
    of 'Rosicrucian' thought was John Dee's disciple, Robert Fludd--who along 
    with Frances Bacon, was among the conclave of scholars commissioned by King 
    James to produce an English translation of the Bible...&quot; </font>Freemasonry: 
    Geometry of the Sacred, by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, pp.20-22<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Perhaps these scholars were only channels for the Spirit, but 
  in either case they were highly and strategically placed, both in time and place, 
  because in our study of history, and the universal dimensions of the Temple, 
  we also discover that ancient Britain is the Tyrus, or the Tyre, of the Prophets, 
  and the original home-port of those earliest of Phoenicians who labored under 
  Hiram, the master-builder, who served, we are told in the Hebrew story, the 
  figures of both David and Solomon in the construction of this most famous of 
  all temples--the Temple of History itself. Please see the books of 1 Kings and 
  2 Chronicles, as well as Ezekiel, chapters 26 to 28, and then understand Paul's 
  words which say: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the 
    Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">If any man defile the Temple of God, him shall God destroy; 
    for the Temple of God is holy, which Temple ye are...</font></i><font size="+1">(1 
    Corinthians 3:16,17; 1 Cor.6:19; Ephesians 2:13-22). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> The Spirit then goes on to say of the Prince of Tyrus, this 
  King <i>James</i> of Divine Right fame, this vainglorious mortal who allowed 
  his name to be affixed upon the Word of God:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <font size="+1"><i>Thus saith the Lord God; Because thine heart is lifted 
    up, and thou hast said, </i></font><font size="+1"><i>I am a God, I sit in 
    the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, 
    though thou set thine heart as the heart of God...</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">But of that particular version of Scripture with his name upon 
  it:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret 
    they can hide from thee...</i>(Ezekiel 28:1-3)</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg296.gif" width="500" height="619"></p>
<p><font size="+1">Of course the whole of it proves in the end to be a Divine 
  indictment against the entire Anglo-American-Masonic-Merchant order, as it is 
  written:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where 
    moth and rust doth corrupt, and where Thieves break through and steal:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither

  <p>Great and manifold were the blessings, most Dread Sovereign, which Almighty

    first he sent Your Majesty's Royal Person to rule and reign over us. For whereas 
    it was the expectation of many, who wished not well unto our <i>Sion</i>, 
    that upon the setting of that bright <i>Occidental Star, </i>Queen Elizabeth<b> 
    </b> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the Virgin Queen, of whom

    some thick and palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this 
    Land, that men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk; and 
    that it should hardly be known, who was to direct the unsettled State; the 
    appearance of Your Majesty, as of the Sun in his strength, instantly dispelled 
    those supposed and surmised mists, and gave unto all that were well affected 
    exceeding cause of comfort...</p>
  <p>To go forward with the confidence and resolution of a Man in maintaining 
    the truth of Christ, and propagating it far and near, is that which hath bound 
    and so firmly knit the hearts of all Your Majesty's loyal and religious people 
    unto You, that your very name is precious unto them...And this their contentment 
    does not diminish or decay, but every day increaseth and taketh strenght, 
    when they observe, that the zeal of Your Majesty toward the House of God doth 
    not slack or go backward, but is more and more kindled, manifesting itself 
    abroad in the farthest parts of <i>Christendom</i>, by writing in defense 
    of the truth (which hath given such a blow to the Man of Sin, as will not 
    be healed), and every day at home, by religious and learned discourse, by 
    frequenting the House of God, by hearing the Word preached, by cherishing 
    the Teachers thereof, by caring for the Church, as a most tender and loving 
    nursing Father...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"><i>God is </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(indeed)</font><font size="+1"><i> 
  terrible to the kings of the earth</i>. And then for an insight to the essential 
  and exclusive structure of the King James version of Scripture compare such 
  verses as:</font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, 
    and say unto him, </i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thus saith the Lord God, </font></i><font size="+1"><i>THOU

  <p><font size="+1">and...<i>Now of the things which we have spoken this is THE 
    SUM... </i>(Hebrews 8:1).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">No other version of Scripture makes the vital connection between 
  these two verses. And then the import of such other verses as : <i>AND IN THE 
  PROCESS OF TIME IT CAME TO PASS, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground 
  an offering unto the Lord.</i>..(Genesis 4:3), and, <i>And Cain talked with 
  Abel his brother: AND IT CAME TO PASS, when they were in the field, that Cain

<p><font size="+1">There is a small collaboration of Kabbalists named Bet HaShem

  <a href="../UsedImages/pg263.gif">proto-Hebrew script</a>, according to the 
  hieroglyphic, thus hidden, conceptual quality of each letter, thereby finding 
  in each letter, word, and phrase of the Torah more information that meets the 
  eye) see in the twelve sons of the twelve fathers--(twenty four elders) of the 
  Twelve tribes of Israel (Numbers, chapters 1, and 2)--twelve primary and interacting 
  organic functions of the human body, and the spiritual concepts that govern 
  them:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The outer Man (the physical 
    body) illustrates the workings of the inner (spiritual) Man. The Body is the 
    means to express and to demonstrate all concepts of light housed within. Twelve 
    main sets of life principles are the source of the Inner Man operations, from 
    every tribe (branching) of Israel. The attributes of father and son--the abilities 
    to instigate and expand--are present in each life operation. For example, 
    the gift and operation of sight is due to the inward presence of Elitsur, 
    son of Shedaur (Numbers 1:5; 2:10). True vision is the result of an ever-abundant 
    source of light </font>(a meaning which is drawn out of the name 'Shedaur')<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    in conjunction with constructive observation </font>(derived from 'Elitsur')<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The twelve sons and twelve fathers 
    in these Torah portions comprise the twenty-four elders…that serve continually 
    around the Throne of HaShem in the Temple. These elders sit in thrones within 
    the inner man, each clothed in white garments, having golden crowns on their 
    heads. As priestly rulers, they direct each man's journey, progress, and use 
    of energy--his sacrifices. Spiritual mindedness is being attentive to their 
    voices of counsel as they administer the affairs of the tabernacle--of the 
    Spirit's place of dwelling...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Among the other functions of the outer (physical) man operations 
  are the endrocine, the digestive, and the reproductions systems, all working 
  together, and all corresponding to some other higher function in the growth 
  and development of the inner (spiritual) man. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">A</font><font size="+1">s we project this understanding of 
  the Twenty-Four Elders outwards, beyond our own individual existences, we see 
  that the number "twenty-four" also corresponds to the four Sefiroth that mark 
  the four corners of the Mystery of Christ on the limbs of the Cosmic Tree, Love, 
  Power, Endurance, and Majesty (4 + 5 + 7 + 8). Here the Twenty-four Elders represent 
  all the Rishis and seers, prophets and saints, teachers, true pastors and servants, 
  male and female alike, out of every race and religious tradition on earth, who 
  have ever come to perfection in the Wisdom of God and the Love of God. They 
  represent the wise and understanding ancestors, and the elders of every past, 
  present and future generation. (Revelation 4:4).</font></p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord not my feet only, but

<p><font size="+1">Study the oracles of the temple again, and notice that as one 
  enters into the Tent of the Mysteries (which only the priests may enter as we 
  know…Math.12:1-8), we are immediately presented with a dilemma, one which reveals 
  itself in the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be 
    the son of God, command these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, 
    It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth

</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg29a.gif" width="400" height="427"></p>
<p><font size="+1">And we see that this dilemma has to do with that Table that 
  is placed on the North side of the sanctuary, upon which the priests must also 
  place the continuous shewbread (Exodus 25:30; 26:35). And then we see that on 
  the South side of this chamber is the Seven Branched Menorah, which, when lit, 
  sheds light upon the whole place (Exodus 25:31-39). It is also the work of Aaron 
  and his seed to light the Menorah (Exodus 27:20,21), thus the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font size="+1"><i>Ye are the light of the world. A City that is set on 
      a hill cannot be hid.</i></font></p>

  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="left"><font size="+1">The shewbread represents the affairs of the 
  body, and the nourishment which flows from God to sustain (in both mind and 
  body) all who have entered the sanctuary, as it is also written: <i>Thou preparest 
  a table before me in the presence of mine enemies...</i>(Psalm 23:5). Thus, 
  by implication, it represents issues of economic and social justice, the plight 
  of oppressed peoples, afflicted families, the poor and the homeless, and the 
  mandate from heaven above that people everywhere on earth, but especially those 
  who have entered into the confines of the Great Temple of God, be afforded the 
  <i>same </i>temporal well-being in this world as everyone else. And it is the 
  priest's work to see that this mandate is carried out, and when it is not, to 
  prophesy against those who stand in the way of its fulfillment, while taking 
  the side and comforting and assisting those who are afflicted:</font></div>

<p><font size="+1">Thus, if one is not involved in these issues, or has little 
  concern for them, if they have not developed a hunger and thirst for righteousness 
  and justice, that soul can proceed no further along the path to spiritual perfection 
  (symbolized by the middle chamber of the Holy Place where the altar of incense 
  is located). The tempter, however, tried to get the Christ-person involved, 
  or absorbed in these issues alone, without regard for what the Spirit of God 
  had to say on the matter. And so, again, to get stuck in a place where he or 
  she could proceed no further. But the mind approaching the Light knows that 
  the solution to these great issues exists with God. And the Menorah represents 
  just that: <i>Every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God</i>...which 
  a great many who are involved in issues of social justice have very little, 
  or, at best, token or selective use for. (They love the intrigue of social activism, 
  but have no mind for the solution). They are as those on the conservative side 
  of the religious spectrum, (and oh how these folks love to quote the word of 
  God), who are also stuck in this chamber. These can move no further either, 
  because, remaining almost childlike in spirit, and unable to comprehend the 
  greater issues of oppression and injustice that surround them, and of which 
  they are a direct and active part, they do not hunger in this way, and remain 
  the fearful companions of capitalists and warmakers, thieves and murderers. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Unless one is driven by a love for both, in equal measure, 
  the poor and oppressed and the Word of God, they can proceed no further. Their 
  thoughts will be out of balance and they will be unable to frame the proper 
  kind of prayer, which is what the Altar of Incense, the next step toward spiritual 
  perfection and toward the revelation of the Mystery, represents. Those who enter 
  here must bring, not only their own thoughts but the prayers and the concerns 
  of the people in there with them. (James 4:1-4; Jeremiah 6:20; 7:1-10). The 
  priest must frame his or her own prayers, and those of the people, properly, 
  and then bequest them to the Most High. Not because the Lord of Heaven cannot 
  make out the intents of every persons own individual prayers; indeed They can 
  and do, and spread a gentle mantle of love and comfort over those who lift their 
  hearts to Them (They are ONE), but because when the people do not pour out their 
  hearts in the right way, and by this we mean, when they do not ask the right 
  questions of God, then God is figuratively unable to respond with the right 
  answers. And without the right answers to the right questions (How? When? Where? 
  What? Why?), we as a people cannot proceed to the final place of initiation, 
  behind the veil, where the Mystery has been hidden all this time in the Holiest 
  Place of All. This place, centered in the heart and mind of every living soul, 
  leads not only to the revelation of the Mystery, but to higher worlds and to 
  the Heavens above. (Please see in the oracles that--just as every soul must 
  descend into human form before it can discover its own way back to its heritage 
  in the world above, or beyond--there is no ascent without descent).</font></p>

    and Intellectual domains--until it stands at the threshold of the higher, 
    spiritual world. If the soul is predestined in its present lifetime to attain 
    to spiritual perfection (as many tens of thousands are in our time) it will 
    find its way to the Center and make the the <i>quantum </i>(mental) leap from 
    the purely Intellectual domain to the Spiritual. A transformation will occur,

  forged out of the structure of this Tree of Life, represents the history of 
  that peculiar people, the Universal Israel, that is passing through the nations, 
  being in turn perfected and redeemed from among the nations themselves. (Rev.5:9,10). 
  The Menorah represents the precepts of the Law and the Prophets as they have 
  been expounded from the time of Moses to our own, and the mystery of the Gospels 
  (as well as the Qur'an) which have accompanied them, and which lead to their 
  fulfillment. And then, as we light the candles again, it represents the manifestation 
  of the Messiahs in our time--a Male and Female, in love, and in perfect balance 
  and reverence toward each other. The two of them shall be revealed in the events 
  of our time, in the name DVD, at the place named Majesty on the Oracle. (Zachariah,

  Eye the spirit of the "Son" (the Lamb) has gone forth (Westward). Thus His hairs 
  are the hair of a Ram, <i>White like Wool</i>, (Revelation 1:14). His Eyes as 
  a <i>Flame of Fire</i>, these are the same Seven Spirits that reveal themselves 
  in the Menorah. (Zecharaiah 4:10; Hebrews 2:1-11). The words, <i>His Feet like 
  unto Fine Brass, as if they burned in a Furnace</i> (Revelation 1:15), represent 
  the collective spirit of the People themselves (the alloy of all nations and 
  races of people), who are all being molded together and fired to perfection

  other dimensions of the Oracle to each other--the mysteries of the West to the 
  East, and those of the North to the South. To get to the world beyond we must 
  go through the Door. The Door leads to a state of Universal Christ-Consciousness

<p><font size="+1">Before we proceed into the following chapters we want to see 
  something else about the structure of the Ark of the Covenant. It is Two and 
  A Half cubits long, One and A Half cubits wide, and One and A Half cubits high. 
  (Exodus 25:10). We see that it is measured in half-cubits instead of whole-cubits 
  for the simple reason that every measurement of the Ark, thus the thoughts as 
  well as the needs of every individual, must overlap the other, and depend on 
  the other for its own state of wholeness and support. We see that it is made 
  up of 45 cubes of one-half cubit measure apiece. We can see that be taking away 
  every cube that faces the outside of the structure, as we strip away every outer 
  meaning of the World Mystery to get to its inner dimensions, that it contains 
  Three perfect cubes within. These represent the hidden tri-partate structure 
  of both nature and history--The heaven (or the East) above, the earth (or the 
  West) below, and the sky and sea (the Middle Realm) between . It also represents 
  the Three divisions of the Sacred City, as it is written: <i>And the Great City 
  was divided into Three parts...</i>(Revelation 16:19). It gives us a fuller 
  understanding of how to read the Oracle. When we fix the Central Mandala of 
  the Tree at that place in the center of Europe, which is where we shall keep 
  it throughout this work (for reasons that will be apparent in the following 
  chapter), we can set its higher dimensions in the East. And from another point 
  of view we can set its lower dimensions in the West. This work proceeds from 
  this same structural point of view: The East above, the West below, and the 
  place where the Great Dragon, the Leviathan, layed hidden all this time, in 
  between. (Please see Chapter 2). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I offered, not this particular set of commentaries but this 
  method of exegesis to a Jewish acquaintance of mine, seeking his opinion, knowing 
  beforehand that he was not predisposed to much mystical theology, (or not from 
  someone who was as seemingly "non-Jewish" as myself). Perhaps while in his youth 
  his family impressed upon him an aversion to speculative Kabbalah. But it was 
  my secret hope that he would find in it the means to reconcile himself to his 
  parents who he seemed to be convinced were "unsaved." Perhaps it is true but 
  not because they are Jewish; possibly it is because they are worldly or unobservant. 
  And then that he might find in it the means to convince his parents to be reconciled 
  to him, because since his conversion to Christianity they are equally convinced 
  that he is unsaved, or "dead." But I suppose I did not have it said quite well 
  enough, so that he could understand how all Jews and Christians are already 
  reconciled, and both to all others when they discover the dimensions of the 
  Tree of Life. A Christian has merely to move from his position on the Left side 
  of the Oracle, the side of <a href="../UsedImages/pg17topisaiahweb2.gif">Endurance</a>, 
  (which we shall see was assigned to the tribe of Levi…Leviticus 8; Numbers 18), 
  and a Jew has simply to move from the Right side of the Oracle, the side called 
  <a href="../UsedImages/pg17topisaiahweb2.gif">Majesty</a> (which we shall discover 
  is assigned to the tribe of Judah)...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p> <font size="+1">To be reconciled they have but to meet at the place named 
  Foundation, beneath the Tree, or at Beauty--in Jerusalem (not referring, of 
  course, to that city-under-seige-again in the Middle East).. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">He said, however, that it was all too esoteric, too presumptuous, 
  and too full of notions that are not familiar to anyone, demanding that one 
  already know something about them: Kabbalah for instance, or perhaps even Quantum 
  theory, with which the Kabbalah is intricately connected (for just as one experiences 
  a breakdown in logic as they approach the hidden center of physical reality 
  where the material and spiritual realms touch and shimmer together, so one must 
  also abandon their past-held notions of history as they approach the hidden 
  center of the Tree of Life). And he said there is an uncharitable preoccupation 
  with judgment in all of this, and not enough of love. But the handmaid of love 
  is judgment, or correction, or Power. They are balanced on the Tree of Life. 
  God presents them to us in both hands…choose. Perhaps this story relates to 
  the criticism: One day while reading from the judgment texts in the streets 
  of New York City, during the mid-day rush when thousands of people were passing 
  by, a woman near her 80th year stopped to listen. Everyone else was too busy 
  with the affairs of empire, and had no time for another "crazed tirade about 
  the end of the world." But the end of something signals the beginning of something, 
  of something wonderful and new. So the old saint, who understood this, asked 
  if she could talk to the people. I almost fell at her feet at the thought of 
  her asking my permission, and praised God for allowing me to be standing on 
  the same spot on earth with her. This wise old African sister began to speak, 
  as loud as she could. She spoke of the love of God, and of God's work in creation, 
  of God's plan to bring the age of Darkness to an end in order to give birth 
  to an age of Light. She spoke of grace, of redemption, of love, and no one listened.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> We live in an age of gross Darkness. The Word of God has free 
  course, but in its most popular and pervasive forms it has been twisted over 
  the centuries to fit a worldly-American-Protestant-Catholic-Capitalistic-Militaristic-Nationalistic 
  scheme of things, <i>And the vilest of men are truly exalted...</i> (Psalm 12). 
  All others have their voice in the wilderness. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Besides the mind in bondage to the material side of reality, 
  besides intellectual pride, and besides the fact that so many people are just 
  plain burned out from hearing every theory on the matter, at least here in America; 
  and besides the fact that in its purest form the Word of God is more than often 
  committed to those who are, or who seem, least qualified to express it--to people 
  without "credentials" (proving that God is truly no respecter of individuals, 
  or of the conventions of men, and that She is indeed dwelling in the depths 
  of the human condition, listing where She will, raising up who She will)--is 
  the fact, as we said before, that the Word of God has come down to us in two 
  forms, a written and an oral (and a thousand interpretations in between; thus 
  the Darkness is accompanied by massive confusion). This means that what is written 
  is found in some books, like the Bible, while the meanings of what is written, 
  how it has and must be interpreted, is found in other books (many other books)--but 
  in legends also, and in the mythology and popular imagination of those whose 
  predecessors first learned the meanings. One must not imagine, for instance, 
  that the Norse myths, which set the Thunderer, Thor, and the Anglo-Saxon Wodin 
  against each other, have no place in reality, or that they are not now being 
  fulfilled in the great antagonisms that (still) exist between Russia (in the 
  East) and the United States. Or that they did not result from the oral teachings 
  of the Hebrew Prophets:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Perhaps my own need was created when, after 10 years of military 
  service (.......) an automobile we happened to acquire at the time was repossessed. 
  We signed a bank note for a friend, so he could purchase a car. He subsequently 
  fell into straits as so many of us do, and was unable to continue the payment. 
  So my wife and I went to the bank to explain the situation, and to assure them 
  that we would continue the payments, but also to ask them not to act so quickly 
  when we fell behind--that we would catch up--trying as we were to raise a family 
  on a very small salary and attend a local college at the same time. We fell 
  behind often, but the car was getting paid off. When one night the agents of 
  the bank crept into the garage and "stole" it. When I complained to them of 
  what seemed to be their plainly criminal behavior, they assured us that their 
  actions were "perfectly legal." Our eyes were opened. We realized that it was 
  not America's laws that were broken (which allow the rich and powerful to exploit 
  and prey upon the poor and working classes), but God's. We learned that the 
  two sets of laws were not only not equal to each other (which we were somehow 
  led to believe), but that they were diametrically opposed to each other. And 
  we wondered why the Church (which sent me away to defend these wicked laws), 
  was not aware of it. It was no mere expression that caused one to wonder, "What 
  in hell is going on around here?" These were radical times, so I vowed to the 
  bank that I in turn would not repay the several thousand dollars we had borrowed 
  <i>to continue our education</i>. Later, as our thinking about such matters 
  were beginning to waver, when we thought about repaying the loan (just to get 
  it behind us I suppose), God deprived us of the means. We found ourselves instead 
  locked out of the mainstream of American economic life, and at the beginning

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In themselves these blessings of 
    modern civilization are quite harmless, but in an indirect manner they do 
    injure us. The pure consciousness is not enriched by study per se, and the

    the beautiful lessons of charity, forgiveness, and forbearance, while those 
    who are trained by hardship and have to learn their lessons on empty or half-filled 
    stomachs are more accessible to the appeals of suffering and want. Consequently 
    the deprivations which the poor students had to undergo in olden times taught

  October, l984; and in its, &quot;The Rise of Christian Conscience,&quot; January, 
  1985, nearly touched the entire matter. And what African-American student of 
  the Scriptures does not know that the 400 years spoken of at Genesis 15:13 pertains 
  directly to the children of Israel's sojourn in America in these last times? 
  Even one mainline publication (perhaps it was <i>Christianity Today</i>, or 
  <i>Moody Monthly</i>), asked several years ago: "Are we headed for another Exodus?" 
  The answer, of course is "yes!" The place does not belong to us. It is stolen. 
  And all things must be returned to their rightful owners in the Great Jubilee 
  (Leviticus 25:8-13). </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I recently awoke from a 
    dream with the sentence echoing in my ears: 'Faith is practicing the future.' 
    I had been studying Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones </font>(see Ezekiel 
    37)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> with a group, and had been particularly 
    struck by the role of the prophet in the "resurrection" of the people. Israel 
    in captivity, he saw, was like a valley filled with dry bones. When God asks 
    if these bones can live, Ezekiel can scarcely muster an answer. Yet (the Lord) 
    orders him--this prophet who was just as dry as his people--to prophesy to 
    the bones, and to say unto them, 'O dry bones, hear the Word of the Lord. 
    Thus saith the Lord God to these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter 
    into you, and you shall live. I will lay sinews upon you, and cover you with 
    skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I 
    am the Lord.'&quot;</font></p>
