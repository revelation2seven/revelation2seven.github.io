<p><font size="+1">Where the Scripture says: <i>Let them grow together, </i> it 
  is immediately referring to the spirits of those two brothers, Cain and Abel, 
  of whom the Book of 1 John also refers when it says:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> The implications will be evident as the impending crisis of 
  war deepens, as the resistance to war intensifies, and as the Mystery of God 
  continues to unfold in the world. Cain and Abel are the literary archetypes 
  of all the children of Darkness and the children of Light in the world today, 
  and particularly all those in the family of humankind who have come full-circle, 
  across the times, and across the sea together, back to the lower Garden of Eden 
  again, to the dimensions of the great World Tree again--the Tree whose branches 
  reach eternally upwards, into the heavens and the Mind of God, and whose roots 
  extend downwards, into the historic consciousness of Adamic man. The history 
  of Adam and all their children is fulfilled in the the universal history of 
  the Mystery of Christ...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg3b-Tree.gif" width="600" height="207"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg152.gif" width="480" height="169"></p>
<p><font size="+1">Both Cain and Abel belong to the same Adamic tradition, and 
  for all historical and philosophical purposes have the same mother--Eve, the 
  &quot;church.&quot; (Understand the literary allusion at Ephesians 5:30-32...KJV. 
  Eve is not a figure of the Feminine gender, but of the religious institutions 
  of Western man). The children of Darkness, however, are all those who--in the 
  name of Adam and Eve (or, as Paul wrote, <i>Christ and the church</i>)--find 
  themselves participating in warfare and in the killing and executions of other 
  human beings (no matter what the reason or the justification...John 8:42-44), 
  and who find themselves participating in the continued destruction (&quot;economic 
  development&quot;) of the Earth in the Face of all the environmental realities 
  of our time. Cain is all those who have grown powerful in the earth, and who 
  are now sitting in all of the seats of authority in the Judaeo-Christian-Islamic, 
  as well as Hindu world, as it is said of them all: <i>The whole world is full 
  of wickedness</i>...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/ConcepcionWH.gif" width="450" height="307"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Cain is particularly all of those who--by outright force, 
  self-deceit, and by blatant ignorance of God's creative purposes in the earth, 
  and of history--have reestablished their base of power here at the Western ends 
  of the earth. He is all those who have defiantly surged across this continent, 
  from East to West, in the face of the words which clearly say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are, </font></i><font size="+1"><i>FOR 
    BLOOD(SHED), IT DEFILETH THE LAND</i><i>; and the land cannot be cleansed 
    of the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him that shed it...</i>(Numbers 
    35:33).</font></p>

    order to amend his ways, but to increase his wickedness. For he only aimed 
    to procure for himself everything that was for his own bodily pleasure, though 
    it obliged him to be injurious to his neighbors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He augmented his household substance 
    with much wealth, by rapine and violence; he excited his acquaintances to 
    procure pleasures and spoils by robbery, and became a great leader of men 
    into wicked courses. He also introduced change in that way of simplicity wherein 
    men lived before </font>(which various indigenous peoples have been attempting 
    to restore ever since, and which the American counter-cultural movement tried 
    to restore throughout the 1960s and 70s)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">; 
    and was the author of weights and measures; and whereas they lived innocently 
    and generously while they knew nothing of such arts, he changed the world 
    into cunning craftiness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He first of all set boundaries 
    about lands, and built a city and fortified it with walls, and he compelled 
    &quot;the family&quot; to come together to it, and called the city Enoch.&quot;

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Kierkegaard turned against 
    all system-making institutions and all systems of thought with driving sarcasm 
    and serene assurance. Lost in a labyrinth of mechanical progress, man, he 
    said, is not only helpless but almost hopeless. His one hope is an understanding 
    of his own existence...Such an understanding, however, cannot be attained 
    by the intellect but by pure faith; not by reason but by rapport with God. 
    This rapport is not possible through dogmas, churchliness, or any ecclesiastical 
    standards, it is achieved only by direct personal relationship with God. The 
    intellect must not only be humbled but, in a sense, crucified before it can 
    be resurrected and &quot;leap to God.&quot; The individual is not a Being, 
    but a Becoming. Christianity, too, is a Becoming--an endless progress through 
    anxiety, insecurity, and suffering; it ceases to be Christianity when it sinks 
    complacently into peace of mind.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kierkegaard objected to the Church 
    as a haven for timid and self-indulgent men; he scorned the ministers of his 
    day for refusing to believe in the Church Militant and for being false seekers, 
    seeking placidity and influential positions in the community rather than salvation 
    through suffering. Christ's teachings, he said, have been so diluted and debased 
    that the Church has practically abolished Christianity in the name of Christ. 
    'Why do we no longer see the contradiction between Christianity's nature as

<p><font size="+1">Any further commentary on the subject of the 20th century, 
  and on the lower nature of man--the <i>Beast</i> being a biblical allusion to 
  the predominant political order of the day, as well as the individuals who preside 
  over that order--should include something of Everett Dean Martin's essay on 
  <i>Civilization Versus Barbarism. </i>Martin lived from 1881 to 1941, and along 
  the way became the pastor of the People's Church in Dixon, Illinois, the boyhood 
  home of Ronald Reagan.. This is a point worth noting seeing how the further 
  point of this chapter will be to demonstrate how the joint structure of historical 
  reality and Biblical prophecy, when seen in the light of each other, reveal 
  the Office of the American Presidency to be none other than the Beast of Revelation 
  itself. (Revelation 13). Martin wrote from a Humanist's viewpoint so we don't 
  say that he drove the nail home, only that he hit it right on the head:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The present menace to civilization 
    is essentially that of barbarism in our midst. Notwithstanding the heroic 
    efforts for universal popular education, the public school does little more 
    than enable the barbarian to read...People may be able to read the papers 
    and still be barbarians. In fact, such papers are commonly designed to encourage 
    and perpetuate barbarism and voice its collective defiance of civilization. 
    Barbarians may own radios, and the programs offered--chiefly in the interest 
    of commercial advertising--may be so carefully selected in fear of offending 
    barbarian prejudice that little of serious value is offered. They may wear 
    modern clothes, vote the party ticket, go to church, succeed in business, 
    run for office, become reformers, be intensely patriotic, go to congress, 
    and never know they are barbarians...They may even set up their own dilemmas 
    as standards of right and wrong for everybody, and imagine that their own 
    externalized efforts at imitation of decency are the very essence of the good 
    life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The conditions of modern life--industrialism, 
    democracy, education--have worked not so much to civilize the barbarian mind 
    as to organize it and make it powerful. All the old traits persist in the 
    New Barbarism; all that is changed is the superficial mode of expression...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Large numbers came to the New World 
    during periods of revolt and disorder in Europe. They have preserved many 
    of the old social and religious and cultural antagonisms ever since. Moreover 
    most of them came from classes which never before in the history of Christendom 
    had enjoyed so much self-expression. Here at the frontier they could express 
    themselves, and do so in an environment where there were no established traditions 
    or institutions (of their own). Their political independence and material 
    success encouraged them to believe in themselves and in their own kind. They 
    became fixed in their rather primitive ways...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lewis Mumford says in 'The Golden 
    Days': 'With pioneering, America ceased to be an outpost of Europe. The Western 
    communities relapsed into an earlier and more primitive type of occupation; 
    they reverted to the crude practice of hunter, the woodsman, the miner. Given 
    the occasion and the environment, these were necessary occupations; the point 
    to be noted, however, is that, uninfluenced by peasant habits or the ideas 
    of the old culture, this work...led to unmitigated destruction and pillage.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The movement into backwoods America 
    turned the European into a barbarian...All three, Puritan, pioneer, and business 
    man, came to exist through the breakdown of European culture; but given the 
    wide elbow-room of America, each type tended to develop to its extreme, only 
    to emerge in succeeding generations into that fictitious and composite character, 
    the average American.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The devastation and plunder and 
    recklessness of the pioneer which Mr. Mumford regards as a relapse into barbarism, 
    now under unrestrained industrialism becomes barbarism rampant, indulging 
    in such extravagant behavior as only plebians, given license and equipped 
    with every technique for exploitation, would try to substitute for the satisfaction 
    of a civilized existence...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CIVILIZATION CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT 
    A CULTURAL CENTER AND PERSPECTIVE AND A SPIRITUAL OBJECTIVE. Only through 
    the spirit can society or civilization be integrated. That we no longer think 
    of the spirit in terms of the old metaphysics...does not mean that existence 
    has lost its spiritual significance. It ought to mean that we are just beginning 
    to see the spiritual from the standpoint of grown-up men and women. The spiritual 
    meaning of civilization--that which we must again integrate to save it from 
    barbarism--is nothing other than our own spirits coming into their true estate 
    and putting the house of civilization in order. The story of America is proof 
    that an ideal society cannot be created out of barbarians.&quot; </font>Civilization

<p><font size="+1">As in the Mind of God so in the shape of natural events--<i>As 
  above so below</i>. And when we are able to see it in the Oracles, as in the 
  East so in the West. Looking further into the Oracle we see that God has not 
  only led the people Westward in these times, but past the Navel of the earth, 
  downwards, to a complete and historically unparalleled encounter with the ways 
  of the &quot;lower&quot; world--with the ways of the <i>flesh</i> (Galatians 
  5:13-26). And not simply with the ways of the <i>flesh</i> in the metaphorical

  Body-Politic, but in the physical sense as well, for the enticements of the 
  one is a direct reflection of the enticements of the other. (Understand Romans 
  1:16-32). Such a descent is, nevertheless, also the path of the <i>Tzaddiq</i>--of 
  the mind coming to spiritual perfection. It follows and gives meaning to the 
  epic of Creation itself, to the mystery of God's descent into the entire field 
  of Human consciousness: God descends in spiritual form into the structure of 
  the material Universe (matter, in reality, being &quot;maya,&quot; pure illusion); 
  the Universe descends to form the galaxies and eventually the Solar system in 
  which we live, and thus still further downwards through the realm of heavier 
  elements to form the planet Earth (which is itself a great descended concentration 
  of spiritual energy). Together the Sun and the Earth conspire in love to bring 
  forth life, and between them give birth in time to a human creature in Their 
  own image. The human soul, then, following the great circular course of spiritual

  potential to discover &quot;self&quot;--its own divine Self. Self at last discovers 
  its own attachment to the Darkness (the lower side of the Sacred Tree from which 
  it has been allowed to partake), cries out, and discovers God majestically Present 
  in the entire process--in the Darkness as well as the Light, in the Evil as 
  well as the Good. (Psalm 139:1-12)...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">For God in the end would have it understood that true &quot;freedom,&quot; 
  a prerequisite to inheriting both the age to come and the world to come, is 
  not manifest in the power to do just as one pleases (as we might seem to be 
  able to in America), or to take material and economic advantage over others 
  (even though the ways to do so are both open and alluring), or in the ability 
  to exercise power, the power of life and death over others (even though one 
  is drawn by some seemingly compelling, and may we add demonic interest to do 
  so, &quot;for only slaves rise to power&quot;), but it consists in <i>the ability 
  </i>to refrain from it all, to place divine limits on one's own ambitions; and 
  it consists in the ability (which comes directly from above, or within) to bring 
  one'self into conformity with all the precepts of Christ, and the life of Christ 
  (whether one calls it Christ or not). True freedom results in a release from 
  Karma--that is, in the ability to perceive the Presence of God, thus in a release 
  from all of the age-ending events that are unfolding everywhere around us. (Understand 
  1 Peter 2:16; 2 Peter 2:19 in light of the events of the American Revolution)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">For the Holy Nation it consists in the ability to overcome 
  the spirit of Darkness that presently governs the Western world, which it is 
  now experiencing in its own collective existence. And in the ability to stand 
  once more before the Presence of Nature itself (which is God) as One Newly Risen 
  Body recommitted to the cause of True Justice, and to the exercise of Real Power--the 
  power to do good but not evil. (Understand Ezekiel, chapter 18; hear the Sermon 
  on the Mount; walk in the Buddha's Eightfold Path). For just as every mother 
  is created in the image of the Divine Mother, and just as every child is born 
  out of the lower regions of its own mother's body, so only in America could 
  the <a href="SideLinks/TheHolyChild.htm">true Holy Child</a> be born into the 
  Light of the coming Day (Revelation 12:1,2). Only in America could the true 
  Servant Nation (the true Spiritual Nation) rise up in the earth (Isaiah, chapter 
  66). For only in America has the world experienced Darkness in its most subtle, 
  and in its most powerful and life-giving form...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Yet how else could God reveal it if They did not reveal it--not 
  only to us, but in us? It is our primal lusts that we speak of, and our <a href="SideLinks/BewareTheHunter.htm">natural 
  instincts </a> (for war)--all masked up now in the guise of lawfulness and righteousness 
  (in the stolen garments of Christ). Thus history has come to pass exactly as 
  it has for this reason: so that the true mind of Christ-in-us could come to 
  its full development. In order to do so it had to experience firsthand the subtle 
  spirit of antichrist (that which pretends to be of Christ but is not, that which 
  uses the name of Christ but does not walk in the precepts and statutes of Christ).We 
  had to see it in ourselves, as well as in the world around us, in order to see 
  how it (the spirit of antichrist) is absolutely incapable of understanding the 
  things of the Spirit, and how defiant it is toward the things of Christ when 
  they are revealed. The terrible and impending issues of war for instance, which 
  those who follow Christ are forbidden to partake in. (Hebrews 12:11-15; 2 Peter 
  3:13,14).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The mind of Darkness, when it resorts to theological explanations, 
  holds that it is the malevolent spirit in man (the Devil, or Satan) that is 
  wreaking havoc in the world, that creates the conditions that lead to warfare, 
  and that, therefore, it is the spirit of &quot;righteousness in us&quot; that 
  must rise up to oppose it--with equal or greater force. When in reality it is 
  the spirit of Satan-in-us that causes us to think in this way. It is the spirit 
  of Satan-in-us that keeps us from seeing that all the havoc in the world comes 
  from God. <a href="SideLinks/GoodandEvil.htm">It is God</a>, and none other, 
  who has been bringing history to bear upon the mind of humanity. And it is God 
  who incites every war in the earth. God is a <i>man of War</i>. (Ex.15:13). 
  Didn't the Spirit send the Word into the world to instruct us in these matters, 
  to explicitly tell us not to engage God in such activities? To <i>follow peace 
  with all men, without which no man shall see the Lord</i>? And especially as 
  this age began to draw to its conclusion? It is the universal and collective 
  Spirit of God who has risen to this great historical occasion. It is God who 
  is presently enticing the nations to come up and meet Him in battle, and it 
  is the Serpent (the primal man) in us who responds...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">How is the Temple defiled? <a href="../UsedImages/pg29a.gif">Look 
  into the Oracles</a>. The Holy Spirit of God led the people into a very high 
  state of mind, and taught them, saying: <i>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for 
  theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. </i>But the leaders of the American church 
  have turned the words upside down. They say, &quot;Blessed are the wealthy, 
  the privileged, and the powerful, for theirs is the kingdom<i>.</i>&quot; Thus 
  the words: <i>And from the time of John the Baptist UNTO NOW the kingdom of 
  heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it be force. </i>(Matthew 11:12). 
  They have grossly neglected the words: <i>For that which is highly esteemed 
  among men is abomination in the sight of God. </i>(Luke 16:15). The poor-in-spirit 
  are those whose hearts are joined to the poor, and thus joined they will be 
  lifted up with them in the day of the Lord. (1 Samuel 2:1-10). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Spirit says: <i>Blessed are they that mourn for they shall

  men, weep and howl, for your miseries that shall come upon you. Ye have heaped 
  up treasures together for the last days. </i>(James 5:1-6). Who can they imagine 
  these words apply to if not themselves? The Spirit says: <i>Blessed are they

<p><font size="+1">If the word of God is not inscribed upon the Forehead (in the 
  forefront of the mind), and the Right Hand (which represents man's own deeds, 
  and his power to perform work, but also his understanding of the Power invested 
  in the Name of God...Y<b>H</b>V<b>H</b>), then the thoughts and ways of fallen 
  men will be implanted there instead. He will think man's thoughts instead of 
  God's, voice man's opinions instead of God's, and perform man's deeds--all to 
  his own eventual undoing. And in this state of severe spiritual bondage he will 
  greet his fellows every day with the Right Hand of his own ignorant ways. The 
  spirit of Cain represents and personifies the lower, fallen, earthly ways of 
  men. Abel represents the spiritual mind coming to perfection. However, when 
  it says: <i>And Cain talked with Abel his brother, AND IT CAME TO PASS...that 
  Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him </i>(Gen.4:9), it means 
  that the lower state of mind in each of us has risen up in time to slay the 
  higher, and that the deed itself has brought all of us collectively to our present 
  state of affairs in the world, with all of its oppression, injustice, warfare 
  and killing, and killing back--in the name of God. Those who kill in God's Name, 
  or consent to it, can never be called the children of Light. (John 1:1-14). 
  Because they do not know who their Father and Mother are, or their Name, they 
  cannot discern Their Face in the faces of those they kill. They are still beasts.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We see the same in the words: <i>And in the process of time, 
  IT CAME TO PASS, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto 
  the Lord </i>(Genesis 4:3). What was his offering? What did he (this &quot;man 
  of the soil&quot;) bring that displeased God so much? <i>If ye know not this 
  parable, </i>the Scripture says, <i>how will ye know all parables? </i>The preceding 
  chapter in Genesis provides the answer. It speaks to Adam, saying: <i>Cursed 
  be the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shall ye eat of it all the days of thy 
  life. THORNS and THISTLES shall it bring forth unto thee...</i>(Gen.3:17,18). 
  What are these Thorns and Thistles? What did Cain bring as an offering, supposing 
  God would be pleased? He brought <i>the Cares of the world </i>(as if God was 
  totally incapable of taking care of Their own world, and as if it were not now 
  in the very same state as God has willed for it)<i>, and the Deceitfulness of 
  riches </i>(as if God was actually in agreement with the way in which the wealth 
  of the world is presently apportioned). (Matthew 13:22). Such offerings are 
  totally unacceptable.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Cain is the primary archetype of all the children of Darkness 
  in the world. (And please be sure to discern the order of <i>Man/Adam</i> from 
  the more ancient human (<i>angelic)</i> order. They exist side by side in the 
  world today, and in all the intermediary states between them...Genesis 1:14-26; 
  Colossians 2:18,19; 2 Thessalonians 1:4-10). The figure of Cain is followed 
  in the Scriptures by <a href="SideLinks/Nimrod.htm">Nimrod</a> who is a further

<p><font size="+1">Biblical scholars have had to press and stretch the scriptural 
  accounts of the 6th century B.C. to make them fit the actual accounts of history 
  itself; and this, again, because modern scholarship has been led to believe 
  that the accounts of the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem, and the carrying 
  away of the people to Babylon in that time, had something to do with a temple 
  in Palestine, or a people who were carried away from there. The prophetic account, 
  however, not only has as much to do with accounts of the future, with things 
  that would not be fulfilled until our time, but it is also an historical allusion, 
  as we have already mentioned, to the Scythian conquest of Eastern and Central 
  Europe. The famed Nebuchadnezzar (or whoever they were whose identities were 
  hidden beneath the term &quot;Let Nebo defend the borders&quot;--Let Nebo perform 
  the works of Darkness), was a composite figure of those Scythian chieftains 
  whose exploits we shall begin to trace with Herodotus who has them coming down 
  out of the North upon the armies of another king who is also invading the regions 
  of Mesopotamia:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;He defeated the Assyrians 
    in battle; but while he was besieging their city there came down upon him 
    a great army of Scythians, led by their king Madyes son of Protothys. These 
    had invaded Asia after they had driven the Cimmerians out of Europe; pursuing 
    them in their flight they came into the Median country...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There the Medes met the Scythians, 
    who worsted them in battle and deprived them of their rule, AND MADE THEMSELVES 
    MASTERS OF ALL ASIA...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Scythians then ruled Asia for 
    28 years: and all the land was wasted by reason of their violence and their 
    pride, and besides that they exacted from each in tribute which was laid upon 
    them, they rode about the land carrying off all men's possessions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The greatest number of them were 
    entertained and made drunk and slain by Cyaxares and the Medes: so thus the 
    Medes won back their empire and all that they had formally possessed...and 
    brought all of Assyria EXCEPT THE PROVINCE OF BABYLON under their rule.&quot; 
    </font><b>Herodotus, Book I.103-06</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The implication here is that the Scythians were still in control 
  of Babylon until the time of Cyrus and Darius, making them the rulers of Babylon 
  to which the prophets refer. Then, because the writings of the prophets are 
  not only filled with apocryphal accounts of the history of those times but with 
  veiled accounts of our times (and with references to other places than the ones 
  we think of when we read the texts), we suggest that Diodorus of Sicily has 
  gotten hold of these apocryphal narratives, and perhaps even the words of Ezekiel 
  themselves, because his reference to the Scythian conquest of Egypt agrees with 
  what (we think) the prophets are saying, while it disagrees with the purely 
  secular account of Herodotus. Diodorus says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This people originally possessed 
    little territory, but later as they gradually increased in power, they seized 
    much territory by reason of their deeds of might and bravery and advanced 
    their nation to great leadership and renown...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But some time later the descendants 
    of these kings, because of their unusual valor and skills as generals, subdued 
    much of the territory beyond the Tannais River as far as Thrace, and advancing 
    their armies to the other side they extended their power as far as the Nile 
    in Egypt. </font>(This is where Diodorus has unwittingly borrowed from the 
    prophetic writings...writings that he cannot understand)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After enslaving many great peoples 
    which lay between the Thracians and the Egyptians they advanced their empire...for 
    this people advanced in strength and had Notable Kings...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was by these kings that many 
    of the conquered peoples were removed to other homes.&quot; </font>Diodorus 
    of Sicily, Bk.2,42<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">While this seems to allow the possibility of the people of 
  Judah being led away from Palestine it contradicts Herodotus who makes not one 
  single mention it. Nor does he make mention of the sack of a place named Jerusalem, 
  which would not have escaped his attention; nor in his account do the Scythians 
  ever reach the Nile as Diodorus said, and which Ezekiel seems to say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Thence they marched against 
    Egypt: and when they were in that part of Syria called Palestine, Psammetichus 
    king of Egypt met them and persuaded them with gifts and prayers to come no 
    further. SO THEY TURNED BACK, and when they were on their way to the city 
    named Ascelon in Syria, most of the Scythians passed by and did no harm, but 
    few remained and plundered the temple of Heavenly Aphrodite.&quot; </font><b>Herodotus, 
    Book 1.105</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">When the prophets used the term <i>Egypt</i> they were not 
  necessarily referring to that place secular historians call Egypt. The prophets 
  always referred to the &quot;<a href="SideLinks/HeavenlyNile.htm">Higher Egypt</a>&quot; 
  which extends on the World Tree from the Upper Egypt in the East to the lower 
  Egypt in the West, and to the whole realm of the Western world in between...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">So when Ezekiel speaks of the Babylonian (the Scythian) conquest 
  of Egypt (Ezekiel 29), he means their epic conquest of the whole Western world,

  one end of the World-Mystery to the other (Ezek. 30)...</font></p>

<p></p>
<p><font size="+1"> According to Herodotus the Scythians did not penetrate into 
  Egypt (which would place the prophets at fault if they were nor referring to 
  another place), nor did they plunder any city named Jerusalem in Syria. Nor 
  does history mention any other kings of Babylon in this period than these Scythians 
  who fled the area before the kings of the Medes and the Persians:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;After the taking of Babylon, 
    an expedition was led by Darius into Scythia. Asia abounding in men, and vast 
    sums flowing into the treasury, the desire seized him to exact vengeance from

    </font><b>Herodotus, Book 4.1</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">These Scythes disappeared into the pages of history. They entered 
  Europe--assimilated--and emerged over the course of time as Picts, Scots, Germans, 
  Saxons, English, and eventually Americans. The whole apocryphal account of it 
  can be gleaned from the second chapter of the Book of Judith, where it says 
  of Nebuchadnezzar's armies:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thus saith the great king (Nebuchodonoser), THE LORD OF 
    THE WHOLE EARTH</font></i><font size="+1">, <i>Behold, thou shalt go forth 
    from my presence, and take with thee men that trust in their own strength,

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It was in the far-reaching context of these events that the 
  Hebrew texts were composed. And because Ezekiel referred to these Scythians 
  who appeared out of the steppes of ancient Russia, as &quot;Gog,&quot; that 
  branch of the American church which is given to (too much) prophetic interpretation 
  still refers to the (then) Soviet Union as &quot;Gog and Magog&quot; (Ezekiel 
  38 and 39). This because these also believe that present-day Israel is the Israel 
  of the prophets (Romans 9 to 11), and because, not sensing or allowing for the 
  overarching course of history, or for the link between the Scythians and their 
  Western cousins...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">...these </font><font size="+1"> believe that the Soviets (Russia) 
  must still fulfill those prophecies that were fulfilled by America and her allies 
  when they attacked Europe from the West during the World Wars--just as the Scythian 
  alliance attacked it from the East in the 6th century B.C. Thus the canon of 
  both the Old and the New Testaments (in the KJV) conclude with the Babylonian 
  epic--just as these times shall conclude with the Nation-church's deliverance 
  from the judgment of America, as it is written: <i>Come out of her my people...for

<p><font size="+1">All Seven of these empires can trace their religious origins, 
  through the Hebrew-Atlantean mysteries, to the Garden of Eden; and the structure 
  of each empire is set upon the same base of the Great Mandala (the figure of 
  the World-Pyramid on the Tree of Life), which spans the earth from West to East 
  and back again. Egypt, a universal symbol of the world-body-politic, is the 
  foundation upon which the entire Western mystery is set. It is the first of 
  these empires to enslave the mind of Light. The story of Israel's descent into 
  Egypt, and its ultimate deliverance, is a metaphor in history of the souls' 
  descent into human form and its ultimate attainment of a state of higher consciousness 
  in the Mystery of Christ. Israel's captive sojourn in that Egypt in the East 
  is a mirror reflection (as we have already discovered above), of Israel's captivity 
  in America in these last days (see Genesis 15:13):</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">After the Egyptians came the Assyrians, whose borders, like 
  Egypt's, also reached back into the ancient past, and to the rivers of Eden 
  (the West). One has but to open any book on ancient near-Eastern or Mesopotamian 
  Studies, in light of these things, to see the direct connection between the 
  ancient Hebrew and Assyrian mythologies, and how they grew out of each other:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I am the king of the world, 
    the king without rival, the Great Dragon, the only power within the four rims

    in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces 
    thereof, and He brought it to ruin...</i>(Isaiah 23:13).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">After the Assyrians came the Scythians (the temporary Masters 
  of Babylon as we have already discovered), and all of the events that inspired 
  the prophets as well as the author of the Book of Daniel with which we must 
  concern ourselves shortly. Simply keep in mind that the Book of Daniel was written 
  to be opened up in the last days--in Babylon. (Daniel, chapter 12).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Following hard after them were the Medes and Persians, whose 
  national mythology also spanned the dimensions of the Oracle from one side of 
  the earth to the other. But there is more to this Persian epoch than readily 
  meets the eye. The biblical (prophetic) account of the Medes and Persians has 
  everything to do with the fall of Babylon (America) in our own times, and with 
  the deliverance of the Holy Nation from its bondage to the present world economic 
  order, as it had to do with Israel's deliverance in those times. It has first 
  of all to do with the fact that the Medes were to ancient Babylon what Russia 
  is to America in our times (see Jeremiah 51:11). And then it has to do with 
  the two Cherubim named Tyrus and Cyrus. (Please see the subchapter in the Addendum 
  by the same name). These are the two Island Kingdoms that lie on either end 
  of the Great Continent Leviathan, which is partly the meaning of the words which 
  say: <i>And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which 
  we cannot now speak particularly. </i>(Hebrews 9:5)...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/TyrusAndCyrus.jpg" width="650" height="386"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> These are the two present-day kingdoms of Britain and Japan. 
  The former (the original base of the ancient Phoenicians) is the beginning of 
  all commercial wickedness in the earth (Ezekiel 28), and the latter, the kingdom 
  of Japan (or Cyrus), has been raised up by God in these final times to conclude 
  the epic and release the people from their bondage to the Western capitalist 
  order (Isaiah 45)....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And after these came the Grecians and the most famous of them, 
  Alexander the Great, about whom a volume of apocryphal legends have sprung up 
  over the centuries. And this because Alexander himself also plays a great part 
  in the unfolding World-mystery. Though he Hellenized and conquered the world 
  Eastward it was all a historic metaphor for the effects he would have on the 
  world Westward. The overspreading of Grecian, and more particularly Greco-Jewish 
  thought, made it possible for the Spirit to obscure the central meanings of 
  the World-mystery and the doctrines of the Universal Israel, while at the same 
  time making Her books and other writings available to the world at large. God 
  was preparing in the coming centuries (after Alexander's conquests) to turn 
  the thoughts of humanity inwards (in the universal dimensions of the Mystery 
  of Christ), toward all the ideas that give meaning to the process of human transformation 
  and the mysteries of Creation itself. (See John 1:1-14; Romans 16:25,26; Ephesians 
  3:5,6). It would begin with those minds who were first capable of transcending 
  the purely natural dimensions of human thought (Grecian thought as it is) by 
  making the quantum leap inwards to the purely spiritual realm of Hebrew thought 
  (the firstfruits of the Spirit). While the Greek mind was cradled and sustained 
  in the purely humanistic dimensions of this great spiritual mystery...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">...the Hebrew mind has come to perfection in the midst of it 
  (or out of the midst of it, if you will). Where the Book of Daniel speaks of 
  the &quot;king of Grecia&quot; it begins so evidently with reference to Alexander, 
  but ever so nonchalantly concludes with veiled references to those kings who 
  would rise up in the last times to rule the earth--the kings of America. It 
  refers to Thomas Woodrow Wilson at Daniel 8:21, and to Ronald Wilson Reagan 
  following the wars of Lesser-Persia--the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and 
  the Iraqi-Iranian conflicts--at Daniel 10:20. The Four Kingdoms that stand out 
  of Alexander's empire at Daniel 8:21-27 are (1) his own--the Grecians of his 
  own time, (2) the Roman Empire that followed it, (3) The Holy Roman Empire that 
  followed that, and finally the American Empire which followed them all, as it 
  is written:</font></p>

  Europe the Mystery of Christ was preparing to return to it. (Acts 1:12; Matthew 
  21:42-44; Psalm 118:22,23). This manifestation and resurrection of the Christ-Mystery 
  would not only be a reenactment of things past (when Israel ascended to this 
  place in the time of Joshua under the name of Dan)<i>, </i>but a preparation 
  for things to come in the last days. In keeping with this realization the author 
  of the Revelation says of this succession of empires: <i>Five are fallen, one 
  is </i>(Rome)<i>, and the other </i>(the Seventh)<i> is not yet come</i>. (Revelation 
  17:10). Thus the next empire to form, after Europe began to emerge from what 
  was called the Dark Age, was the Holy Roman Empire. Its monarchs did not know 
  it but they eventually set their thrones right down in the center of Jerusalem 
  itself. God established them at the pinnacle of the World-pyramid, at the center 
  of the World-Tree, at the place named Beauty in the center of Europe. How could 
  these sons of Darkness know that beneath their imperious feet lay the ruins 
  of the fabled City of David? God had completely sealed it from their minds, 
  and from the mind of the great World-church that blessed and upheld them and 
  their claim to power. (Compare Ezekiel 16 and Revelation 17). How, then, could 
  any of them see what was going to take place there in the 20th century, when 
  the Wheel of Shiva (<img src="../UsedImages/Swatstika.gif" width="29" height="14">)

<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasue'rus of the 
    seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; In 
    the first year of his reign</font> </i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1917)</font><i> 
    <font size="+1">I Daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof 
    the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish 
    Seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem...</font></i><font size="+1">(Daniel 
    9:1,2; Jeremiah 25:1, KJV)<i>.</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Let us put these things in a wider historical and prophetic 
  context. In the Book of Daniel it says: <i>SEVENTY WEEKS are determined upon 
  thy people, and upon the Holy City, to finish the transgression, and to make 
  an end to sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, AND TO BRING IN EVERLASTING 
  RIGHTEOUSNESS</i>...all of which speaks of events leading up to the last days 
  (our time, when the books are to be opened); but then it says: <i>AND to seal 
  up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy. </i>(Daniel 9:24). 
  This last clause speaks, not of the end but of something that was preparatory 
  to it, or which set the conditions for it (of a time when the books were being 
  sealed). The verse is actually referring to two separate periods of Seventy 
  Weeks. Seventy weeks are 70 X 7, or 490 days. And as is done in biblical interpretation 
  (as everyone already knows), we also understand it to mean 490 years. (See Ezekiel 
  4:6). We further reason that history has come to pass in segments of 490 years 
  each, or in <a href="SideLinks/TheSeventhMonth.htm">Jubilee periods</a> of 49 
  years each (see Leviticus 25:8), which also, of course, implies a certain amount 
  of periods of Seven years each (for 7 is a factor of both 49 and 490). Letting 
  time adhere to all of its own requirements (its own prerogatives and intercalations), 
  we see that the history of Adam falls down roughly into a period of 120 Jubilees 
  (120 X 49), or 5,880 years. This makes three periods of 40 Jubilees, or three 
  periods of 1,960 years each: the first from the time of Adam to Abraham; the 
  second from the time of Abraham to Christ; and the third from the time of Christ 
  to our own. This also adds up to Twelve periods of 490 years each, for 12 X 
  490 also totals 5,880 years...</font> </p>
<p><font size="+1">One of these 490-year periods transpired between the end of 
  the captivity in Babylon and the time of Christ, when the <i>vision</i> and 
  the <i>prophecy</i> was sealed up (with Seven Seals) and the Most Holy One (and 
  the Most Holy Place in the center of Europe) was anointed. But for the moment 
  we are concerned with the preceding period, with the 490 years that transpired 
  between the time of Saul and David and the carrying away and subsequent deliverance 
  from Babylon<b>--</b>the period of the Hebrew Kings. We will lift up this entire 
  block of time (<a href="../UsedImages/pg19topweb.gif">in the same way</a> as 
  we did in the Introduction), and lay it directly down on top of the last 490 
  years of our own times, or roughly the period that has transpired from the turn 
  of the 15th and 16th centuries, with the Reformation and the (re)discovery of 
  America, to our own present day. When we make Central Europe the focus of these 
  things, rather than Palestine, we can not only gain a glimpse into the history 
  of those ancient times, but we can see how God brought it all to pass again, 
  this time, as we have said, from the West instead of the East. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We have taken this list of the Hebrew Kings--from Saul to Zedekiah 
  who was led away &quot;blind&quot; to Babylon, and the years that each king 
  reigned before the time of Christ--from a popular Bible Handbook. (Some may 
  wish to argue over each particular set of dates</font><font size="+1">. The 
  point is that the structure of these times, and their generally accepted dates, 
  yield to our sense of them). Next to each name is another date corresponding 
  to the time in which we say these events took place again, as they began to 
  have their <i>effect</i> in these last times. (See Ezekiel 12:23). The key to 
  the set of dates marked A.D. is the verse at Jeremiah 25:1, where it says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Word of the Lord came to Jeremiah concerning all the 
    people of Judah </font></i><font size="+1"><i>IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF JEHOIAKIM 
    the son of Josiah king of Judah, THAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF NEBUCHADREZZAR</i> 
    <i>king of Babylon</i>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We then reason that the First Year of Nebuchadnezzar was the 
  year Thomas Woodrow Wilson declared war on the Central Powers of Europe, when 
  America entered the First World War, as Paul said: <i>Beware lest that come 
  upon us which was spoken in the prophets...</i>(Acts 13:40,41; Habakkuk, chapter 
  1), and as it was also written:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Follow PEACE with all men, and HOLINESS, without which 
    no man shall see the Lord.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; 
    lest any ROOT OF BITTERNESS springing up trouble you, and thereby many be 
    defiled...</font></i><font size="+1"> (Hebrews 12:14,15).</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;WOODROW WILSON was a great 
    war leader and crusader for world peace who insisted that the United States 
    must share responsibility for maintaining international stability. In his 
    first term he brought to fruition a basic program of progressive reform the 
    New Freedom. In his second term he mobilized the manpower and industrial might 
    of the United States, which helped bring an Allied victory in the war to make 
    the world &quot;safe for democracy.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson sought to implement that 
    ideal through the League of Nations, but the Senate blocked the entrance of 
    the United States into the league and frustrated his dream.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps because his earliest memories 
    were of the Civil War, Wilson's most earnest hope was for permanent peace. 
    He was born in Staunton, Virginia, in 1856, the son of a Presbyterian minister 
    who during the Civil War had a church in Augusta, Georgia, and during Reconstruction 
    taught theology in charred Columbia, South Carolina...</font></p>

  end of the Seventy years of captivity, and to the time of the Messiah(s) who 
  are found together, not only in the name of DaViD, but in the figure of Zerub-babel. 
  (See Zechariah, chapter 4, and the chapter entitled Paul, Elisha ben Abuyah).

<p><font size="+1">And though the times seem to have also exceeded even the Eighty 
  years, 1917 to 1997 (they have been allowed to continue as it says in the Habakkuk 
  Commentary in the Dead Sea Scriptures), all the principles in the drama are 
  still with us, and the same set of events are still unfolding. The times have 
  been fulfilling themselves in a very precise manner, not only since James Earl 
  Carter came to power in 1975-77, but since Thomas Woodrow Wilson (Thomas the 
  Contender's) reign from 1914 to 1922. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Open the books of David and Solomon in the tenth century before 
  Christ. Open them again in the years 1500 to 1600 A.D. Study the history of 
  this period from every spiritual angle and discover all the connections that 
  exist between, say, ancient Tyre and modern Britain (the beliefs and doctrines 
  of the Masonic order is an excellent place to begin), and between the Hebrew 
  Kings and the monarchs of Europe. (<i>Holy Blood, Holy Grail, </i>by Lincoln, 
  Baigent, and Leigh, is a good primer as long as one does not get caught up in 
  its purely literal conclusions). And let us not insist that these kings of Israel 
  be literal persons, but rather let us see them as literary embodiments of the 
  ideas and otherwise unknown personalities, as well as a figurement of the events 
  that were governing the mind of Israel in those ancient times. Open the pages 
  of the Book of Isaiah during the time of the First Olympiad and the founding 
  of Athens, of which the mind of Israel took part in 776 B.C. Open the Book again 
  during the time of the American and French Revolutions, as it is written: <i>In 
  the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. </i>(Isaiah 
  1:1). As we open the books of the prophets in their proper times we see why 
  the Book of Revelation is a composite, or a paraphrase of all their parts, because 
  each must be opened again and understood in the light of all the unfolding realities 
  of our times. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">As we open the pages of the Book of Isaiah, however, during 
  the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, we find the king of Assyria besieging 
  Jerusalem (see chapters 36 to 39). This is no longer the ancient Assyrians, 
  nor is it the American leaders yet, who are the ultimate Assyrians, but Napoleon 
  Bonaparte (whose realm, nevertheless, extended to America at that time). See 
  him, a god, at war with God (as if such a thing were actually possible). But 
  what we really must see in this insolent one is a middle reflection of the greater 
  spirit of Assyria that existed on either side of him, in the ancient East and 
  in the America to come...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This verse in the Revelation unravels by studying the structure 
  of the oracles in light of the number seven, and of the &quot;Seven Times,&quot; 
  that were made to pass over history between the time of the prophets and when 
  their writings finally came to pass in these last centuries. <i>Let Seven Times 
  pass over the king of Babylon</i> it says in the Book of Daniel. (See Daniel 
  4:16). Actually the idea of Seven Times can be expressed in two ways: figuratively 
  as Moses expressed them, as <a href="SideLinks/SevenCircles.htm">Seven Circuits</a> 
  of time (see Joshua, chapter 6), and as the Seven Times, or Seven Years of time, 
  that passed over the king of Babylon: (7 X 365 equals 2,555 days, or 2,555 years). 
  This many years, for instance, carries the mind almost directly from 776 B.C. 
  to 1776 A.D. when the Book of Isaiah opens for the second time. And it also 
  carries the mind of Israel from the time of its first captivity in Babylon in 
  the 6th century B.C. to its captivity in Babylon again in the 20th century. 
  (Daniel 4:10-37). These Seven times, or Seven Circles of time, can also be expressed 
  figuratively in terms of months, 7 X 12, or 84 months, half of which is 42 months...or 
  42 months and 42 months as it is delineated in our verse at Revelation 13. It 
  was used in this way to express a half-time, or a half-measure, but more specifically 
  to express something hidden in the middle of this prophetic time frame--and 
  in this case the entire Assyrian epic, and Napoleon's appearance in the middle 
  of it at the turn of the 19th century. Thus in this particular reference these 
  months are not literal but figurative. And we see that the words in Isaiah concerning 
  the kings of Assyria were not entirely fulfilled in ancient times, nor in the 
  time of Napoleon, but were intended to continue on until they reached the West--the 
  original land of Assyria--and all the events that are still unfolding in our 
  time, in the midst of this, the &quot;American century:</font><font size="+1">&quot;</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thus saith Hezekiah, This is a day of trouble, and of

<p><font size="+1">Napoleon against Central Europe, against the East, against 
  Russia, and against the religious world (but we must understand this with a 
  keen mind, because such things always work in favor of true religion; they are 
  terrible, however, to worldly religion and ecclesiastical heresy). He came for 
  a &quot;short time&quot; to fulfill in type and image what the American antichrist 
  must fulfill, and what all of them have been fulfilling since the beginning 
  of the world wars. In Napoleon the Assyrian mysteries were returning to the 
  land of Eden, and to the completion of the words:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This text in Isaiah is obviously speaking of events that will 
  unfold in the West, at the Foot of the Tree of Life in the last days. Likewise 
  the Book of Daniel leads us in the same geo-historical and political direction 
  at Daniel 7:1-11, when it speaks of the Four empires, Babylon, the Medes and 
  Persians, the Grecian, and the Roman (which it likens to a Lion, a Bear, a Leopard, 
  and a Terrible Creature). It speaks of &quot;Ten Kings&quot; that shall arise 
  out of this Fourth empire, of one that shall arise in the midst of them, and 
  of the other that will arise afterward who is diverse from the first:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Thus he said, The Fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom 
    upon the earth</font></i><font size="+1"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
    fourth from the time of Babylon)</font><font size="+1">, <i>which shall be 
    diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and tread it 
    down and break it in pieces.</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And the Ten horns out of this kingdom are Ten kings that 
    shall arise: AND ANOTHER SHALL RISE AFTER THEM; AND HE SHALL BE DIVERSE FROM

<p><font size="+1">In these prophecies Four kingdoms are cited to conform to the 
  dimension of the Four powers of the World Tree, and to demonstrate how the Power 
  of God extends into every quarter of the earth and into the affairs of every 
  nation and empire. The prophecies were fulfilled as the affairs of the Roman 
  empire became those of the Holy Roman emperors, and then as these intrigues 
  evolved in all of the political and religious complexities of the 20th century. 
  The prophecy itself focuses on the same empire (the Roman) that was in power 
  when the Empire of Christ dawned upon the earth. It saw how the two would grow 
  up in the earth together, the one metamorphacizing by way of the Holy Roman 
  Empire into the American Empire (the <i>Feet </i>of iron and clay), while the 
  other remained hidden, and its citizens strangers and pilgrims in the earth 
  until the times were full. The prophecy says of the Beast that shall appear 
  in the last days, that <i>He shall subdue three kings. </i>This means that this 
  empire shall be recognized (for the time being) as the only existing superpower, 
  as it is also written:</font></p>

  and space, and across the pages of history, and how it came upon America's shores 
  in the hearts of the first colonists only to be set up again in the 20th century. 
  If he had remembered, neither he or his successors would have boasted of this 
  great kingdom that they were building, or of their might and power, especially 
  not in the presence of so many oppressed, and, even more especially, not in 
  the Presence of the Lord of the Oppressed Himself. He would not have allowed 
  himself to be placed on a throne again, at any time in this age--especially 
  one that his own self-professed master refused to sit in, (Matthew 4:8-10). 
  And he certainly would not have attacked Judaea again as he did in the 6th century 
  B.C., because he would have remembered where it was. He and all of his advisors 
  would have been able to interpret the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And I stood upon the Sand of the Sea, and saw a Beast 
    rise up out of the Sea </font></i><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(see 
    Revelation 17:15)</font><i><font size="+1">, having Seven heads and Ten horns,

  <p><i><font size="+1">And the beast that I saw was like unto a Leopard, and 
    his Feet were as the feet of a Bear, and his mouth the mouth of a Lion... 
    </font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...and apply them to themselves. The author of the Revelation 
  is referring to the list of Beasts (political empires) at Daniel 7:1-7. The 
  Leopard represents Alexander's empire, whose spirit now dwells in the leaders 
  of America, whose ancient territorial conquests, however, are now peopled by 
  the nations of Islam. Islam is presently likened to a leopard because its own 
  true remnant--like the true remnant among Christians here in the West--is reduced 
  to small areas, or spots, of true spiritual resistance here and there. These 
  are surrounded everywhere by the swift (to judgment) and violent adherents of 
  the religious world itself. The Bear represents the next empire, the Medes and 
  the Persians, whose ancient spirits are now risen up in Russia (the original 
  home of the Medes) and Eastern Asia. The American empire is presently treading 
  roughshod over both, attempting now more than ever to dictate its own military, 
  political, and economic will throughout the earth. Thus the Lion here represents 
  the spirit of ancient Babylon itself, which is now risen up in America, as it 
  is written: <i>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, AS A 
  ROARING LION, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. </i>(1 Peter 5:8). 
  The office of the American Presidency, and the American empire over which it 
  presides, is an embodiment-in-one of all these powers together. It is the reflection, 
  as well as the focus of attention, of all the dark powers of the earth that 
  have risen up everywhere around it--and against it. (Romans 8:19-23; Romans

  all seem to some like a cruel cosmic trick to play on the Judeao-Christian world, 
  but the mind of darkness-in-us could not have been instructed in any other way. 
  <i>The whole head is sick,</i> says Isaiah. The cure lies in the disease itself. 
  Had the spirit of the world-ruler been given access to the meaning of the oracles, 
  the evil impulse that is intrinsic to us all, and which dwells in the recesses 
  of the collective human psyche, would remain there, unrevealed, thus untreated. 
  The result: not only ceaseless oppressions and injustices but in continual seditions 
  and social intrigues and uprisings, in revolutions and counter-revolutions, 
  or in seemingly incomprehensible and random acts of violence that the world 
  is given to so much in our time. This is not only due to man's pernicious and 
  spiritually irrational obsession with weapons (an evolved technological projection 
  of his own violent self-will), but to the fact that there are large portions 
  of the human mind (the cyberspace of the soul) simply not filled by right-experience, 
  or touched by right-reason. Great spaces in our minds that must be filled early 
  and made whole through right experiences, right touchings, right joys, right 
  concerns, right explanations, right directions, right outlooks, and right loves, 
  are simply left unconnected. Every hug, every kind word, every encouragement, 
  every shared insight, every new experience, creates not only another neural 
  connection in the brain but opens, or facilitates the vital spiritual pathways 
  that lead to right understanding, and finally to the world above (or within). 
  Without these spiritual connections we are rendered incapable of perceiving 
  the Whole of Reality and of responding to it in any of the right spiritual ways. 
  God, however, is providing all of these connections in our time, in all the 
  necessary ways, and in the process has been creating in the world all the potential 
  for right Love...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What the great mass of us in our time take for normal sociological 
  behavior and, by extension, normal political and economic behavior, is perceived 
  by those who are attaining spiritual maturity as the effects of a severe and 
  deeply-rooted spiritual psychosis. What most consider to be a generally sane 
  and normal approach to life (the American way of life in particular), is considered 
  by the spiritually mature--those who have been touched by Right Mind--to be 
  pure madness, and at times utter depravity. Look into the capitals of the Western 
  world, and Washington D.C. in particular, and see what the leaders are doing 
  in God's Name, hear what they are saying, observe how they are acting, watch 
  everyone following them. It is sheer madness. Those who are put away in hospitals, 
  or otherwise afflicted psychologically and emotionally, are (like that suffering 
  aspect of Christ), bearing about in their own complexed souls the sicknesses 
  of the whole society. They are carrying our burden. In a word, the entire Western 
  political, economic, and religious order is spiritually, thus mentally/psychotically 
  sick. And like the most delusional among us, it believes that it is not. Had 
  Woodrow Wilson a more normal spiritual life, had he been given proper spiritual 
  instruction, and had the pattern of history been laid out clearly to him, the 
  history of the 20th century would have been different. On the other hand, had 
  he real access to the mind of Christ as he imagined he had, thus access to the 
  deep implications, and the hidden meanings of the sacred oracles, he would not 
  have revealed himself as the great Son of Darkness that he was, nor would those 
  who followed in office after him. And in the great psychological economy of 
  all things we would have remained in our collective state of darkness, without 
  any hope of salvation, or regeneration. In spiritual reality though, even if 
  he had access to the oracles in his time the world would still have the problems 
  that it has. The oracles could not have been read then, not by the children 
  of Darkness: </font></p>

    inauguration as President of Princeton his father died. His entire life had 
    been dominated by his relationship (and his passivity) to his father...In 
    the customary manner, he replaced his lost father by himself and thenceforth 
    in his unconscious he was more than ever the Reverend Joseph Ruggles Wilson. 
    Thus he found outlets for his aggressive activity to his father...in his political 
    activities...His addiction to speech-making, which was already excessive, 
    grew to fantastic proportions...He began to display increased inclination 
    imperiously to rearrange the world and to hate with unreasonable intensity 
    distinguished men who disagreed with him. (This was the reaction-formation 
    through hostile actions against other father figures as well, according to 
    Freud)...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson's hope emerged in his address...On 
    May 20, 1916, he said: 'I would like, therefore, to think the spirit of this

    of counsel and of peace, of accommodation and righteous judgment before the 
    world and reminding them of that passage in the Scripture: &quot;After the 
    wind, after the earthquake, after the fire, the still small voice of humanity.&quot;' 
    On May 30, 1916, he said, 'AND THIS SPIRIT IS GOING OUT CONQUERING AND TO

    light.' He was ready to lift up his light and let it shine even upon Germany. 
    'Came he not into the world to save sinners?'...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson finally began to feel that 
    the Allies, not Germany, stood between him and achievement of his desire to 
    be the Savior of the World...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He </font>(like Ronald Wilson Reagan

    the facts of reality and in a large measure he succeeded. The facts of the 
    war became to him not the actual facts but facts he invented to express his 
    wishes...He began to utterly believe in his own phrases. By his words he made 
    many men in many lands believe that the war would end in a just peace, and 
    he made all America 'drunk with this spirit of self-sacrifice,' but no man 
    was more deceived or intoxicated by his words than himself...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He announced that the war was a 
    crusade, knowing well in one locked chamber of his mind THAT THE CRUSADERS 
    WOULD NEVER REACH THE HOLY LAND </font>(They did)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    but believing in the rest of his mind, because he wanted to believe, that 
    by the words he had learned at his father's knee he would lead all the armies 
    past selfishness AT LAST TO THE HOLY SEPULCHER of universal peace, where they 
    would find--Himself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson's identification of himself 
    with Christ was unquestionably the chief psychic force which made it so difficult 
    for him to make that decision to go to war...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his speech of October 5, 1916 
    he said: 'The singularity of the present war is that its origin and objects 
    have never been disclosed...IT WILL TAKE A LONG INQUIRY OF HISTORY TO EXPLAIN 
    THIS WAR. But Europe ought not to misunderstand us. We are holding off not 
    because we do not feel concerned, but because when we exert the force of this 
    nation we want to know what we are exerting it for...When you are asked, &quot;Aren't 
    you willing to fight?&quot; reply, yes, you are waiting for something worth 
    fighting for; you are not looking about for petty quarrels, but you are looking 
    about for that sort of quarrel within whose intricacies are written all the 
    texts of the rights of man, you are looking for some cause which will elevate 
    your spirit, not depress it, some cause in which it seems a glory to shed 
    human blood, if it be necessary'...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of the war...he described 
    the Peace Conference in the following words: 'An illumination of profound 
    understanding of human affairs shines upon the deliberations of that conference 
    that never shone upon the deliberations of any other international conference 
    in history.' Thus by September 17 the Treaty of Versailles had become divine, 
    AND THE NEXT DAY THE AMERICAN ARMY HAD BECOME THE HEAVENLY HOST. 'That is 
    the glory that is going to attach to the memories of the great American army, 
    that it not only made conquest of the armies of Germany, but made conquest 
    of peace for the world. Greater armies than sought the Holy Grail, greater

<p><font size="+1">One should not only read this entire study of Woodrow Wilson 
  (in order to see more completely into the structure of the mind of Antichrist), 
  but should complete it with a psychological study of Sigmund Freud himself. 
  One should comprehend the great difference (the great leap) that existed between 
  his materialistic and empirical view of the human psyche and, say, Carl Jung's 
  attempt to see into the Deeper Presence of the Divine in the Collective Unconscious 
  of human thought and behavior. (Please see the subchapter entitled <i>Thomas 
  the Contender</i>). Even though Freud lived and practiced in Vienna, at the 
  very navel of the World Mystery, he (as Wilson himself), was not invited by 
  the Spirit to penetrate the inner dimensions of the material order. He could 
  not break through the realm of the Id (the primal point of man's own Serpentine 
  nature) to discover that other quantum dimension of time and space where God 
  so majestically resides--right there in the entire and collective sum of human 
  consciousness itself. It is from there (or right here), that He and She rule 
  the universe. Which does not mean that Freud had no insight to reality at all, 
  such as the idea that certain forms of unconscious behavior are seated in forgotten 
  and repressed parts of the psyche, it is just that he was hardly conscious of 
  the implications. Apply the construct to the whole history of Western man, however, 
  and we gain a picture of the root cause of all our present social and political 
  disorders, as well as the correct prognosis and the cure (which the true Messiahs 
  shall prescribe)... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Had Freud been given access to the meaning of the Oracles he 
  could have shown both his patients and the world--not from a &quot;merely religious&quot; 
  point of view but from a completely scientific point of view--the way back to 
  God, which is also, of course, the way back to Wholeness of Mind. By following 
  the pathways of the sacred Oracle he could have shown us how to open up each 
  of our own individual <i>chakras</i>, one by one, guiding us from Tiphereth 
  to Kether, and from Tiphereth to Malkhuth, and finally back to Kether again 
  by way of all the other Sefirot.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/GoddessTree.gif" width="450" height="450"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> He could have shown us how the process of descent is the natural 
  pathway to human understanding and to Self Realization, and how such a descent 
  so often leads one into the lower, twisted passageways of human experience before 
  it brings one back up to the light again. But how could he have understood such 
  things without his own American experience, and without having arrived at the 
  end of this century himself? He would have also finally understood, among other 
  things, that God is ONE with His own Feminine manifestation (in all Her wonderful 
  and mystical personifications). He is ONE with the Divine Mother--and not at 
  odds with Her at all, or in competition with Her for power, as such stern, controlling, 
  and dogmatically repressive and un-romantic father-figures are everywhere. And 
  as such females are, who, denied their own identities as already powerful human 
  spirits, with their own separate mystique, seek to fulfill themselves in the 
  world that misguided males have created and sustained for themselves--in the 
  Power Principle. Such types give birth to the next generation of authoritarians, 
  or to other repressed souls who are left to lurk around, lost in the shadows 
  of their own minds (searching for their own true identity), both without love, 
  needing love, needing approval, and incapable of extending it in any real life-giving 
  and self-fulfilling way to others. Freud would have seen that as the soul ventures 
  inward (not simply away from the clatter and the confusion of the outer world--as 
  many &quot;mentally disordered&quot; people seem to be trying to--but actually 
  through it, as spiritually healthy people must), it does not only return to 
  that ancient City, and to the universal laws of that City (which are the Mother 
  of us all), but it returns to the threshold of a fully sound mind, balanced 
  in every way. This path also leads to the age to come and the world to come. 
  One discovers that everything humanity is collectively, and everything that 
  each of us are individually, and everything we have ever been, has brought us 
  to this moment in time, this moment of awakening, this moment of redemption, 
  this time of healing....</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And, of course, we are also talking about sexuality here, because 
  sexuality is the impulse, the engine that drives the material universe. Though 
  it is related in its most unrestrained, undisciplined, and misdirected forms 
  to the natural (fallen) state of man, it is also related to humanity's highest 
  impulse, and to humanity's most emotionally and spiritually satisfying state 
  of mind as well. At its highest tantric level, deep sexual desire coupled with 
  love, reverence, and devotion to one another, as to God, is the most sublime 
  expression of the Divine Union that exists between the Male and Female principles 
  of Reality (between the Father drawn heart and soul to Her, and the Mother drawn 
  with all her being to Him). The whole spiritual (erotic) epic has brought us 
  to this time in history and to the opening pages of the Kama Sutra of the West, 
  <i>The Song of Songs Which is Solomon's</i>, thus to the great and fulfilling 
  love that we will see exists between God's anointed ones in our time; and to 
  our own marriage to them as a people; thus to the fullest expression of God's 
  relationship to all of us together. All of it has evolved, Westward (one might 
  say in defiance of guilt and neurosis), not only in the pursuit of true love 
  but in the interest of understanding the meaning of true love itself--what it 
  is, and what it is not. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The children of Light are now capable of right touching, of 
  right feelings and right desires, right relationships, right aversions, and 
  right love, and of extending this healing touch to the world around them? As 
  such they also had to be brought to a state of right realization, and to an 
  understanding of the importance of right concerns, right labors and right intention. 
  These talents and gifts could only come to a generation of people who have been 
  allowed by the Spirit to experience the world in all of its potential--for both 
  good and for evil. Which means that they could only come to those who have been 
  allowed to encounter the Serpent--in themselves, in the world around them, and 
  finally in the form which they could not have understood in any other way--in 
  the great deceptive spirit, as well as in the person(s) of Antichrist itself. 
  Seeing at last how the terrestrial world and the extraterrestrial world are 
  one and the same, how they interpenetrate, and operate together, and being made 
  to understand its sublime and terrible implications, the mind coming to perfection 
  will understand its calling--its purpose in the earth. And it will seek for 
  ways to fulfill this calling. There are milions in the Earth today who, through 
  divine intuition alone, and through the force of love alone, already feel this 
  calling, and who simply lack a political order in the earth that is in harmony 
  with it, one whose only economic purpose in the earth will be to organize and 
  support these spiritual energies and to give them direction. This is what God 
  is accomplishing in our time. The true Messiahs will see that the world is disposed 
  to these efforts. (Isaiah 2:1-4; Revelation 22).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This prophecy of the last times can ultimately apply to no 
  other kingdom, or empire, than America, and the events foretold can apply to 
  none other than those which are presently preparing to unfold in the world. 
  To count the number of the Beast (Revelation 13:18) one must perceive in Thomas 
  Woodrow Wilson the familiar spirit of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He began 
  to fulfill this appointment in 1917 when he led America into war against the 
  very Terrible Presence of God (the God of War) who had also risen up in the 
  affairs of the world at that time to judge the world. (Such things should have 
  been clearly apparent to the mind of the Nation-Church). SIXTY years later the 
  Twelfth king of Babylon, James Earl Carter, appeared on the throne of Babylon. 
  The number begins to reveal itself in the third chapter of Daniel:</font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height 
    was THREESCORE </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Sixty)</font><font size="+1"> 
    <i>CUBITS</i>, <i>and the breadth thereof SIX CUBITS</i>: <i>He set it up 
    in THE PLAIN OF DURA</i>, <i>in the province of Babylon...</i>(Daniel 3:1).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The ancient Babylonians employed a base-60 mathematical system, 
  in contrast to the base-10 system used later and most generally throughout the 
  rest of the world. The world, however, adopted the Babylonian system as a measurement 
  of time--thus Sixty seconds in a minute, and Sixty minutes in an hour. The prophets, 
  likewise, employed the number to symbolize things that would come to pass in 
  the last days, in the realm of Babylon again, when the great circle of time 
  completed itself here in the Western ends of the earth.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg3azodiac4.gif" width="650" height="472"></p>
<p align="center"><b>The number 60, a measure of Time.</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">The image that was set up was that of the king of Babylon himself, 
  and in our times it is that of the Office of the Presidency of the United States 
  of America. (Daniel, chapter 4). The image was already set up in the hearts 
  and minds of the American people, but in Wilson it was set up in a new and greater 
  way. It was set up in the minds of the people of the world. It is impossible 
  not to be influenced by this man and his office, for he has <i>MAGNIFIED </i>himself 
  in the earth. On the surface of every present political and military reality 
  he is the most powerful man on the face of the earth; and in the name of Christ 
  he, along with all his advisors and teachers, his priests and his prophets, 
  teaches his subjects to disobey Christ. This is the <i>Mystery of Iniquity </i>fulfilled. 
  (See 2 Thess. 2:7,8). The Holy Spirit strives peacefully in the hearts of humanity, 
  calling them to come enter the Covenant of Life. The president and his ministers 
  strive against the things that lead to life, for where in America, and to whom 
  can the new-born soul go to exercise the kind of justice and pacifism that it 
  comes to realize that God now requires of it? Of course, into the spiritual 
  wilderness, <i>out from among them</i>, as the Spirit commands. And even then 
  one cannot find a place to follow the imperatives of the spiritual life, in 
  the midst of such a world system that has also invaded the wilderness...</font></p>
