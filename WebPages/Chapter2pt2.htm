    Behemoth and Leviathan: Job 40:15-24, and Job, chapter 41. As the Mystery 
    of God was unfolding and the Nation (not the American nation, but the Higher, 
    Universal Israel which is sojourning among the nations of the world), was 
    returning to the West in the company of the children of Darkness, to what 
    was called "the New World," but which was, in fact, a rediscovery of very 
    old world, there was a mapmaker busy at his craft whose name was Gerardus 
    Mercator. The method he developed for transferring what was known about the 
    world at that time onto a navigational chart was called a Mercator Projection. 
    It is a flattened rendition upon which we find all the northern quarters of 
    the globe disproportionately stretched out, so as to gain the effect of having 
    all the longitudinal and latitudinal lines perpendicular to each other. What 
    was divinely and perfectly timed about it was the fact that Mercator was duplicating 
    in the mechanics of his map--even without knowing it--the ancient words of 
    Job which said: <i>He stretcheth out the North over an empty place, and hangeth 
    the earth upon nothing.</i>.. (Job 26:7). When we look at the continent of 
    North America with its northern regions stretched out we can...</font></p>

    Italy is the immense tongue protruding from the mouth of this Dragon. Asia-minor 
    and Scandanavia are its Left and Right limbs. All of Asia is its body, and 
    the Orient is its tail.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The myth was common to a number 
      of schools, but Hippolytus ascribes it to an otherwise unknown school called 
      the Peratae, supposed to mean Transcendentalists, or those who by means 
      of the Gnosis had 'passed beyond' or 'crossed over.' Thus they explained 
      the Exodus-myth…EGYPT IS THE BODY; all those who identify themselves with 
      the body (the lower, material world) are the ignorant, the Egyptians. To 
      come forth out of Egypt is to leave the body</font><b> </b>(In the figurative 
      as well as spiritual sense)<b>, </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and 
      to pass through the Red Sea is to cross over the ocean of generation, the 
      animal and sensual nature, which is hidden within the blood. Yet even then 
      they are not safe; crossing the Red Sea they enter the Desert, the intermediate 
      state of the doubting lower mind. There they are attacked by the 'gods of 
      destruction,' which Moses called the 'serpents of the desert,' which plague 
      those who seek to escape from the 'gods of generation.' To them, Moses, 
      the teacher, shows the true serpent crucified on the cross of matter, and 
      by its means they escape from the Desert and enter THE PROMISED LAND, THE 
      REALM OF THE SPIRITUAL MIND, where there is the Heavenly Jordan, the World-soul. 
      When the waters of Jordan flow downwards, then is the generation of men; 
      but when they flow upwards, then is the generation of the gods. Jesus (Joshua) 
      was one who caused the Waters of Jordan to flow upwards…&quot; </font>Fragments

    <p><font size="+1">The answer lies inside of those things that have been sealed 
      up with <i>Seven Seals</i> all these centuries: the Mystery of <i>the City 
      Above, the Mother of Us All</i>. (Galatians 4:24-26). Thus it lies in the 
      realization that when the mind of Israel came up <i>out of Egypt</i> in 
      those ancient times into <i>the land of Promise</i> (as it did again in 
      the time of Christ), it was not into the land of Palestine that it came. 
      It was, rather, from the land of Palestine that it went. (For the Promised 
      land is not "land" at all, but a Promised State of Mind. In the highest, 
      thus in the most perfect sense of the Mystery of God, the only "land" in 
      this world that a child of Light is allowed to rule over with authority 
      is their own being, their own individual bodies--the land and the empire 
      of their very own soul). Thus, at the direction of <i>Moses</i>, after having 
      established all of the necessary images in stone (which included both the 
      literal precepts of the Torah as well as that lower city made of stone in 
      Palestine), and then following the course of the Higher Sun, the higher

      paid tithes to the King of Salem, Melchizedek. </font>(Hebrews, chapters 
      5 to 7...KJV)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Although we cannot 
      know for certain that this is a reference to Jerusalem, it seems likely 
      because Abraham was in that geographical area, and the city's name, Salem, 
      is the root word of the city's later name, Jerusalem. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later, we are told that Abraham 
      went to Mt. Moriah, just north of ancient Jerusalem, to offer his son, Isaac, 
      as a sacrifice (Genesis 22:2). That mountain was later incorporated into 
      the city of Jerusalem during the time of Solomon, becoming the Temple Mount. 
      The first mention of the city by the name of Jerusalem is found in Joshua 
      10:1 where we are told that the city's king, Adonai-zedek, led a coalition 
      of kings against Joshua and was defeated in the famous battle in the Valley 
      of Ayalon when the sun stood still. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the Jebusites must have reclaimed 
      it because it is later referred to in Judges 19: 10 as the city of Jebus. 
      And it was still in Jebusite hands two centuries later when David conquered 
      it and made it the capital of the Jewish nation. The story of the city's 
      capture by David and his forces is recorded in 2 Samuel 5 and 1 Chronicles 
      11. According to these passages, David decided to move his headquarters 
      northward to a more central location. The city he selected was Jebus, which 
      was also known as &quot;the stronghold of Zion&quot; (2 Samuel 5:7). After 
      he conquered it, the name was changed to Jerusalem, but it was often referred 
      to as &quot;the city of David&quot; (2 Samuel 5:9).</font><b> </b></p>

    of every race and religious tradition on earth, who have transversed the times 
    in this unfolding Mystery of Christ, and who have come out of great tribulation 
    in the East, to America (see Exodus 19:10,11 and Revelation 7:13,14). It must 
    be understood, however, that the children of Light and the children of Darkness 
    have come across these times together. The spirits of Cain and Abel have returned 
    together, to the roots, and to the beginning of the entire epic; and it is 
    because of the presence of this spirit of Darkness in the earth that all these 
    great judgements are being visited upon the world. (And, as we see, which 
    are now being visited again in the Middle East against a Zionist state which 
    has no legitimate spiritual concern in that land, and against America, which 
    has come to the time of its great judgment as well...see Isaiah 30:25,26, 
    and Revelation, chapter 18). And it is because of the spirit of Light in this 
    land, that which is being born out of this great Darkness, that the mysteries
