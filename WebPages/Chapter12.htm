<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Awake ye drunkards, and weep and howl, all ye drinkers 
    of wine, because of the new wine, because it is cut off from your mouth.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For a nation </font></i><font size="3">(America and its 
    Western allies)</font><font size="+1"><i> is come up upon my Land, strong, 
    and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek 
    teeth of a great lion.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">He hath laid my Vine waste, and barked my Fig Tree: he

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Because the children of the Universal, Epic Nation of Israel 
  were promised no land in this, or in any other age, the concept of the Land, 
  and particularly the Promised Land, has always been a Scriptural metaphor for 
  the body (made of earth) that every individual posseses, and a state of mind--a 
  Promised State of Mind--that every child of Light shall ultimately inherit. 
  In America, however, the people have been led to believe they had already attained 
  it, or that it was at least theirs for the taking. And we find parents readily, 
  and eagerly, preparing their children to get their piece of it. Those with the 
  biggest pieces, who have already tasted the fruit of this land--the Fruit of 
  Opportunity--want their children to have still bigger pieces of it, more fruit, 
  more opportunities. So day by day the parents bring them. (They do not all bring 
  them willingly of course; many have been made to, against their will. And others 
  bring their children against their better spiritual judgment, perhaps because 
  they can not avail themselves of alternatives). But day by day the children 
  come (no unexcused absenses, or the parents will be placed in jail), lesson 
  by lesson, video by video, movie by movie (the present Disney syndrome), report 
  card by report card, field trip by field trip (to the factories and the malls 
  of course), practice by practice, game by game, recital by recital, fashion 
  by fashion, purchase by purchase, want by want, diploma by diploma, career by 
  career, deposit by deposit, investment by investment, speech by speech, sermon 
  by sermon, Sunday by Sunday, Sabbath by Sabbath, until they have been wholly 
  trained up and conscripted into the American way of Life. (And, as George W. 
  Bush intimated at a speech at the Pentagon this week, we cannot imagine it any 
  other way. Or why on earth, he asked, would anyone have cause to be angry at 
  America? But how is it written: Isaiah 66:15-18). Having been trained up to 
  become good producers and good consumers the people are further rewarded for 
  their loyalty with all the further blessings of American life. It is written, 
  however, <i>Woe to them who call evil good...</i>(Isaiah, chapter 5)<i>. </i>In 
  the international world of Give and Take, or &quot;givers&quot; and &quot;takers,&quot; 
  Americans are the &quot;Takers,&quot; and they have been trained up to be so, 
  (in direct violation of both the teachings of Christ and the natural ethics 
  of all the children of Mother Earth wherever they dwell throughout the planet).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The children, as little sheep, have been led, in both the public 
  and private religious schools of this nation, to keep their minds on the &quot;Right&quot; 
  side of the political and religious spectrum, the side of Power and Majesty, 
  and to hold in reverence those who have attained to these positions in public 
  life, and to pledge allegience to them. (The words say &quot;To the flag,&quot; 
  but they actually mean, &quot;To those who uphold the idea of the flag, and 
  who exploit the message of the flag to their own fullest advantage&quot;). Of 
  course this is the side of the Tree of Life upon which the true Messiahs will 
  also be manifest:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg17topisaiahweb2.gif" width="468" height="658"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center">The only obstacle standing between the people (all of whom 
    are assembled at this time in history around the Seventh sefira on the Tree 
    of Life named Endurance) and God's anointed ones is the American state of 
    mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> Focusing on the Oracle we find the spirit of Antichrist ruling 
  there instead. Even when one finds themselves drawn to the things that are unfolding 
  on the Left side of the Tree, the present side named Love and Endurance, they 
  find that every attempt to awaken the people (from over there on the <i>Left</i> 
  as it is), or to point out some blatantly wicked action or behavior of the American 
  body-politic, and of the religious institutions that support it (even in light 
  of the teachings of the prophets), is met with an almost concerted resistance. 
  People's minds are closed, they have been trained not to listen to it. Such 
  criticism, of course, is in the finest American tradition of protest and rebellion, 
  so it is allowed. (&quot;And where else would they be allowed to&quot;--the 
  people unmindfully reason)? The issues are swiftly assimilated into the broad 
  stream of the national consciousness and rendered unmeaningful. (A sown seed 
  perhaps? Someone said that American patriotism is three thouand miles wide, 
  but only a half an inch deep. We shall see). In the meantime individuals and 
  families continue to be digested before our eyes. The wealthy continue to grow 
  wealthier. And the earth continues to be dishonoured, and ravished. In other 
  words the Word of Life continues to be tread underfoot. And spiritual wickedness 
  in High governmental places continues unabated. The Darkness is so pervasive 
  it is almost taken for Light. And now the people have come and laid themselves 
  and their sons and daughters down on the altar of Operation Desert Storm. (And 
  now again in its great unfolding sequel, Operation &quot;Enduring Freedom&quot; 
  in Afghanistan, of which we shall move onto at the end of this chapter. The 
  following text, however, represents our impressions and interpretations of the 
  events of George Bush, the father's, war in the Gulf--events, nevertheless, 
  which are still in motion):</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">All the mysteries of the (original) Garden of Eden were carried 
  out of the West in ancient times, and transplanted there in Mesopotamia and 
  along those river systems that flow through present-day Iraq, a land which we 
  have come to associate with the whereabouts of the Garden of Eden to this very 
  day...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg442.gif" width="684" height="545"></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Thus that whole land was <i>AS</i> the Garden of Eden before 
  the allied forces of Desert Storm. <i>The morning cometh</i>, (and the restoration 
  of all things), says Isaiah, <i>but first the night</i>. (Isaiah 21:12). This 
  refers to the night of spiritual darkness that we are all now experiencing. 
  Jews in Palestine likened Saddam Hussein to a modern Haman, and others likened 
  him to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. In America they celebrated his defeat 
  in a great historic way. The parade in New York City was an obscene spectacle, 
  a grandiose flag-filled celebration of American military might, technological 
  superiority (the work of modern wizards), and of its immense ability to kill 
  abroad without being killed at home. (God has been extremely prudent toward 
  America so far, giving her great space to repent). It seemed that not one person 
  among the throngs at that parade were even scarcely aware of the great danger 
  that exists, not only to their own mortal lives, but to their own eternal souls, 
  because of their allegiance that day to the great American (Roman) Juggernaut. 
  (These words, of course, were written several years before the events of September 
  11th, 2001). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Had God not provided a Remnant in this generation the real 
  spirit of Haman in this world (the spirit of the American Antichrists) would 
  have everyone completely in its grip, and dead to the fullest realizations of 
  their own higher precepts and traditions. The reason Jews don't see it is because 
  they do not think the traditions and the history of Christianity have anything 
  to do with spiritual reality to begin with, at least not with Jewish reality, 
  or with the history of Israel as they see it. Jews, for the very most part, 
  think that the nation of Israel is a purely Jewish phenomenon, and that its 
  center as well as its capitol is over there, (in the East), and as such they 
  look upon Saddam Hussein as a devil and not as an imminent judgment upon themselves; 
  and upon America as a protector and not a spiritual oppressor, (or as the Great 
  Satan as others in the Middle East still call it). Jews remain oblivious, as 
  they are to almost everything beyond their own self-interest, to Christianity's, 
  and thus to America's claim to the mantle of Israel, and therefore to almost 
  any idea whatsoever concerning the concept of antichrist. They do not believe 
  in Christ, why on earth should they believe in an antichrist. (1 John 2:18,19, 
  2 Thessalonians 2, KJV). The idea is actually foreign, not only to Jewish consciousness 
  but to liberal as well as to modern intellectual consciousness as well. It is 
  indeed<i> A Day of THICK DARKNESS</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Speaking to the nation the real spirit of Haman said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Regrettably the Noon deadline 
    passed without an agreement of the government of Irag to meet the demands 
    of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 660. </font>(again, see 
    Isaiah 59)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. To the contrary, what 
    we have seen is a redoubling of Saddam Hussein's efforts to destroy completely 
    Kuwait and its people...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have therefore directed General 
    Norman Schwarzkopf, in conjunction with coalition forces, to use all forces 
    available, including ground forces to eject the Iraqi army from Kuwait...The 
    liberation of Kuwait has now entered a final phase.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tonight as this coalition of countries 
    seeks to do what is right and just, I ask only that all of you stop what what 
    you are doing and say a prayer for all coalition forces risking their lives 
    for their country and all of us. </font>(see 1 Cor. 10:20-22; Ezekiel 16:20,21)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    May God bless and protect each and every one of them and may God bless the 
    United States of America.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">He and his counselors, his ministers, his priests and his prophets, 
  remained completely oblivious to the pleadings of God in this matter (see Joel 
  3:2), to the drumbeat of reason, or to the many voices of supplication that 
  were raised across America. &quot;Were you moved,&quot; he was asked after an 
  episode in church when John Schuchardt stood up in the congregation and implored: 
  &quot;We need to think of the 18 million people of Iraq; half of them children. 
  We must think of what it means to be bombed (from the air) every day by 2,000 
  planes and cruise missiles...&quot; &quot;Not in the least,&quot; he replied. 
  &quot;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,&quot; cried Schuchardt, as he was escorted 
  to the door shouting, &quot;Stop the bombing! Stop the massacre in the Name 
  of God!&quot; How could this president be moved by such words? God had completely 
  shut his mind. &quot;Once assailed for his weakness, Bush is now lionized for 
  his strength,&quot; said the New York Times. <i>Let the weak say, I am strong, 
  </i>said the prophet<i>. </i>(Joel 3:10).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Writing in the February 15, 1991 edition of the <i>Jewish Press, 
  </i>Tzvi Zev Ben Yahuda does not only unwittingly describe the things that God 
  is preparing to bring upon America when he describes what America did to Iraq, 
  but his half-sided view of the conflict represents an indictment of America 
  anyway, no matter how you look at it, because if his view of Iraq being Babylon 
  was correct, then it was America who fulfilled the words: <i>Behold, a people 
  shall come from the North, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised 
  up from the coasts of the earth. They shall hold the bow and the lance. THEY 
  ARE CRUEL, AND WILL SHOW NO MERCY</i>. (Jeremiah 50:41). Well, they didn't show 
  any mercy. Nevertheless, this text speaks of the judgment that shall fall upon 
  America itself, as it is also written: <i>In the cup which she has filled, fill 
  to her double. </i>(Revelation 18:6). Yehuda, in his rejection of the Christian 
  mysteries, had no insight into the hidden structure of these things, into the 
  Law of Correspondances, and could not imagine in his own national, and perhaps 
  even personal duress how Saddam Hussein and George Bush were spiritual images 
  of each other in these affairs when he wrote:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;All prophecies refer to the 
    days of Messiah. Since we are in (those days) it follows that the period written 
    about in the book of Jeremiah applies to our time. In Jeremiah, chapter 51, 
    the battle to come against Babylon is described in an extensive manner, realizing 
    that the geographical boundaries refer to today's Iraq. Reading through the 
    chapter almost conclusively confirms that the battle described is today's 
    war in the Gulf.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The battle begins with a massive 
    bombardment of Iraq with Tomahawks and thousands of sorties from the air. 
    The Iraqis remain in their bunkers. 'Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will raise 
    up against Babylon.' Jeremiah starts comforting us by telling us that this 
    war is waged by God and the outcome, as foretold in this chapter, will therefore 
    surely follow. 'And I will send into Babylon strangers that will shatter her, 
    and will empty her land, for in the day of trouble they shall be against her 
    round about.' Initially these strangers will empty her land as they form an 
    economic belt 'round about' her...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Make bright the arrows, fill the 
    quivers...because His device is against Babylon, to destroy it; for it is 
    the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of His temple...'&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg296.gif" width="500" height="654"></p>
<p><font size="+1">America (the true modern Babylon), has, indeed, helped to shake 
  into the consciousness of many Iraqi people, and of thinking Muslims elsewhere, 
  a desire for a more peaceful Criterion than the one that presently drives Islam 
  in that part of the world, but in the process it has hastened the words that 
  also say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">How is the Hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! 
    </font></i>(This is not Iraq)<font size="+1"><i>. How (shall) Babylon become 
    a desolation among the nations.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, 
    O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because 
    thou hast striven against the Lord.</font></i><font size="+1"> </font>(This 
    is America)<font size="+1">...(Jeremiah 50:23, 24).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Addressing his troops upon their return, Bush said, &quot;When 
  you left it was still fashionable to question America's courage, America's resolve. 
  No one--no one in the world doubts us any more. What you did helped us revive 
  the America of our hopes and dreams.&quot; &quot;No question about it, the country's 
  solid. There isn't an anti-war movement out there.&quot; It's over, finally, 
  the last <i>t</i> is crossed, the last <i>i</i> dotted.&quot; &quot;The first 
  test of the New World Order has been passed...the hard work of freedom awaits.&quot;...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">How could he, or any of his ministers know that as he spoke 
  God's true spiritual warriors were still strapping on their armor, and preparing 
  themselves for the battle. (Ephesians 6:10-17; 1 Kings 19:18; Rev.11:13). &quot;The 
  war is now behind us,&quot; Bush told the nation. &quot;Seven month ago America 
  and the world drew a line in the sand. We declared that aggression against Kuwait 
  would not stand, and tonight America and the world have kept their word.&quot; 
  Such a great leader, with such great words of his own, should not be surprised 
  then to hear that God also keeps Their word. How is it written: <i>There are 
  many voices in the world and none of them is without signification.</i> (1 Cor.14:10). 
  The following is a speech also given by Saddam Hussein to his retreating troops:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the Name of God, the merciful, 
    the compassionate. O great people, stalwart men in the forces of holy war 
    and faith, glorious men of the Mother of battles; O zealous nations,, and 
    among all Muslims and all virtuous people in the world; O glorious Iraqi women...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was an epic duel which lasted 
    for two months, which came clearly to confirm a lesson that God has wanted 
    as a prelude to faith, impregnability and capability for the faithful, and 
    a prelude of an (abyss), weakness, and humiliation God has wanted for the 
    infidels, the criminals, the traitors, the corrupt, and the deviators.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To be added to this is the time 
    of the military and non-military duel, including the military and economic 
    blockade, which was imposed on Iraq and which lasted throughout 1990 until 
    the time God Almighty wishes it to last...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It gave depth to the Age of Showdown...All 
    we have gone through or decided within its circumstances, obeying God's will 
    </font>(exactly true)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> and choosing 
    a position of faith and chivalry, is a record of honour, the significance 
    of which will not be missed by the people and nation and the values of Islam 
    and humanity...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This will shake the opposite ranks 
    and cause them to collapse after everything has become clear...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God says, 'Like a goodly Tree whose 
    root is firmly fixed, and its branches reach to the heavens. It brings forth 
    its fruit at all times by the leave of its Lord.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then everything will be possible 
    on the road to goodness and happiness that is not defiled by the 'feet' of 
    the invaders nor by their evil will, or the corruption of the corrupt, and 
    who spread corruption in the land of the Arabs. Moreover the forces of plotting 
    and treachery will be defeated for good. Good people and those who are distinguished 
    by their faith, and by their faithful and honourable stands of holy war will 
    become the real leaders of the gathering of the faithful everywhere on earth...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The earth will be inherited, at 
    God's order, by His righteous slaves. 'For the earth is God's, to give as

    the righteous.'...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, 
    also, it will be clear that the harvest does not precede the seeding, and 
    that the threshing floor and the yield are the outcome of a successful seeding 
    and successful harvest.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The great difference between Hussein's words and those of George 
  Bush to the American people, though they are the same in tenor (egomaniacal), 
  is that Hussein's words unknowingly comprehend the true spiritual dimensions 
  of the conflict. Hussein, the absolute slave of God, opened his mouth and spoke 
  as his Master (the Lord of the Universe) gave him utterance. Bush opened his 
  mouth, and his Master let him speak out of the torrents of his own heart. Hussein 
  makes no claim to being a son of God, that is <i>a Christ</i>, (he refers to 
  himself as a slave), but George Bush by his own profession of the Christian 
  religion claims such an honour, as it is written: <i>For both he that sanctifieth, 
  and they who are sanctified are of one</i>...(Hebrews 2:11)...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and 
    doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a 
    rock...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth 
    them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon 
    the sand:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the wind 
    blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew 
    7:24-27).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It should also be noted by Muslims everywhere: slaves do not 
  inherit their Master's house. Only true sons and daughters do. And the truly 
  mature ones are commanded to get up off of their knees, and <i>Stand Upon Their 
  Feet</i>. (Ezekiel 2:1,2). <i>For the Father </i>(Allah) <i>loveth the Son, 
  and sheweth </i>(them)<i> all things that He himself doeth.</i> (John 5:20). 
  (Please see the chapter entitled <i>The Mystery of Islam)</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the keys to the Oracle one should be able to comprehend 
  the import of every spoken and written word, whether they emanate from the center 
  of spiritual reality (from the Mind of God), or far from it--from the minds 
  of men; (thus, whether they spring from the Light or the Darkness), and therefore 
  how sincere, or how deceptive, and in what way every word serves to facilitate 
  the economy of God's will. (see Hebrews 4:12; Malachi 3:18),</font></p>

    has told the Soviet Union that it is the losing side. That theme accompanies

    of the Soviets. After summoning tyhe Atlantic allies to join in an effort 
    to redraw the military map of Europe with sharp East-West cuts in conventional 
    weapons, Bush urged that the political map be redrawn too. And on Western 
    terms.</font></p>

    Bush said in Mainz, West Germany...&quot;It can only end when Europe is whole.&quot;</font></p>

  facilitate the ascendancy of Ronald Reagan and George Bush to the throne of 
  Babylon (Revelation 13:11), but to precipitate those events that have unfolded 
  in the world since the collapse of the Soviet Order, as it is also written: 
  <i>Let no man beguile you in the worshipping of angels, intruding into things 
  he hath not seen</i>. (Colossians 2:18; Hebrews 1:14).</font></p>

  are playing in history, all of which shall lead to the redemption and the liberation

  the midst of the American nation)? Only as they relate to the earthly or materialistic 
  aspects of this great drama--<i>facts on the ground</i> as they say in the Middle

  dominant phrases of the American leaders who pretend to speak in the name of

    diversity of its concrete manifestations. That would be a futile undertaking. 
    But something else is just as true. Conducting a correct scientifically substantiated 
    policy is possible only if there is clear understanding of the tendencies 
    of reality. Through penetration into the dialectics of what is taking place

    Never has man exacted so much tribute from nature, and never has he proved 
    to be so vulnerable to the might that he himself has created. World development 
    confirms the fundamental conclusions of Marxism-Leninism that the history 
    of society is not a disorderly 'Brownian movement,' but a law-governed, progressive 
    process. Its contradictions not only pass sentence on the old world and on 
    everything that impedes progress, they also constitute the source, the motive

  higher reality--every bit of which escapes the reasoning of American leaders. 
  What has been the course of historical events since this time? The prelude to 
  Resurrection itself. (For a further insight into the things God was preparing 
  for America, in the immediate aftermath of the Soviet Union, as well as throughout 
  the rest of the world, read David Halberstan's <i>War In a Time of Peace, Bush,

  to be the virtual collapse of the entire Communist order itself. Save for the

  <p align="center">TIME RAN TOO FAST FOR SPRINTER GORBACHEV</p>
  <p align="center">By James Gannon</p>
  <p>For Mikhail Gorbachev, the man who accelerated history, time seemed to slip 
    into some frantic high gear. From the moment the impatient Soviet leader came 
    upon the world stage in 1985, the pace of historic change leaped into fast 
    forward, compressing into his six years the work of as many decades...</p>
  <p>Few leaders who have spent so short a time in power have etched such a large 
    place for themselves in history. But his signal accomplishments were unintentional, 
    astonishing their instigator as they astonished the world. He set out to reform 
    Communism, not bury it; he meant to rejuvenate the Soviet Union, not liquidate 
    it.</p>
  <p>His monument is rubble: the Berlin Wall, the Soviet empire, the economy of 
    his country, the smashed icons of Communism--Marx, Lenin, Stalin. He ruined 
    what he set out to renew, but the world is better for all that.</p>
  <p>&quot;His place in history,&quot; says Soviet specialist Robert Hormats, 
    &quot;is that he presided over the destruction of the old system. His role 
    was not to build a new one. His role was to be the creative destroyer.&quot;</p>
  <p>Gorbachev, observes Michael Mandelbaum of the Council on Foreign Relations, 
    &quot;performed one of the great services of the 20th century--he destroyed 
    Communism in Russia. He was a Communist reformer, and that turned out to be 
    an oxymoron--he couldn't reform the system.&quot;</p>
  <p>He had a dream that Communism could be renewed by exposing it to the sunlight 
    of political freedom and the oxygen of economic reform. What he did not know--what 
    we did not know--was that after seven decades in the suffocating dark of communism, 
    the fabric of his society was so rotten that sunlight and oxygen were catalysts 
    for disintegration...</p>
  <p>His time of power effectively ended with the abortive August coup, but he 
    desperately clutched the last shreds of leadership until his irrelevancy became 
    clear last week. His time, which always ran too fast, finally ran out. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gannett

    who made history, while Mikhail Gorbachev every day is having to plot to hold

    like the First Citizen of the world, in power, influence, and prestige. No 
    one else comes close...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But one idea is a-borning--the 
    idea of order, born out of collective security. Because of it the Gulf War 
    was a just war. Because of it, the present Middle East disorders and civil 
    wars will find their check. And because of it, by the millennium's end, George 
    Bush will still be a crucial figure in history. It will not be for his &quot;new 
    world order&quot; alone. Even more it will be because the climactic idea of 
    our time, that of order, is also a moral idea. It includes what the world 
    has long needed--a sense of limits, collectively secured.&quot;</font></p>

    readiness and their ability to comprehend emerging problems and to solve them.</font></p>

    that prompt one to call it perhaps the most alarming period in history.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first group of contradictions, 
    the most important from the standpoint of the fate of mankind, is connected 
    with relations between the states of the two systems, of the two formations. 
    These contradictions have a past extending over many years, Since the time 
    of the Great October in Russia...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The difficulty that the ruling 
    classes of the capitalist world have in understanding reality and the periodic 
    recurrence of attempts to resolve by force the whole group of contradictions 
    dividing the two worlds are not accidental...Imperialism is impelled by its 
    mainsprings and its very social and economic essence to translate the competition 
    of the two systems into the language of military confrontation...Today as 
    well, the right wing of the U.S. monopoly bourgeoisie regards the aggravation 
    of international tension as justification for military appropriations...The 
    policy of total opposition, of military confrontation, has no future. Flight 
    into the past is no answer to the challenges of the future; rather it is an 
    act of desparation...Washington's deeds will show them when and to what extent 
    it recognizes this. For our part we are ready to do everything in our power 
    to change the international situation for the better...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem and crises that are 
    being experienced by the capitalist world arises within its own depths and 
    are a logical result of the internal contradictions of the old society. In 
    this sense capitalism negates itself as it develops. Unable to cope with the 
    problems of the downside of the development of capitalism, the ruling circles 
    of the imperialist countries are resorting to ways and means that they know 
    are unable to save a society doomed by history itself...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All this cannot continue indefinitely. 
    Needless to say, one cannot hope for miracles, the situation is not going 
    to straighten out by itself. The military force that the U.S. counts on to 
    maintain the status quo, to protect the interests of the monopolies and the 
    military-industrial complex and to prevent further progressive transformations 
    in the newly-liberated countries can only complicate the situation and engender 
    new conflicts...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, isn't all the experience 
    accumulated by mankind enough for us not to want some future crisis, but to
