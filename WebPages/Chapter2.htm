  <p><font size="+1"><i>And the saints shall rest in Eden, and in the New Jerusalem

<p align="center"><b>The earliest map of Eden</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are, scattered throughout all the ancient texts and prophetic 
  books, hints of the whereabouts of the garden of Eden, and talk of two more-distantly 
  mythological creatures, the great Ox, Behemoth, and the equally great Dragon, 
  Leviathan. (Job 40 and 41). Our interest in these things was sparked sometime 
  ago, in the early 1960s, in an article in the Sunday section of one of Jacksonville, 
  Florida's daily newspapers. The subject of the article, Elvy E. Callaway of 
  Bristol, Florida, after describing the nature of his work--a search for the 
  actual location of the garden of Eden by comparing topographical images, and 
  other data concerning all the places on earth suspected of being the site, with 
  the description of it in Genesis 2:7-17--rejected all possibilities but one. 
  He concluded in a book entitled <i>In the Beginning</i>, that the only place 
  on earth fitting the description from both a geographical and geological point 
  of view (and may we now add the historical point of view), was the region and 
  the river-system that lays along the Florida-Georgia-Alabama border in the <a href="../UsedImages/pg93mysterygaweb.gif">southeastern 
  corner</a> of the United States...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg2mapprint.gif" width="650" height="634"></p>
<p align="center"><b>A River Went Out of Eden...(Genesis 2:10; Ezekiel 20:46-49 
  KJV).</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Hearing no more of this work, only keeping those things in 
  that place in our minds where curious things are stored, we thought no more 
  of it--until 1975, when from these same hills and forests came James Carter, 
  a candidate for the office of President of the United States. (A "born-again 
  christian" vying to become the most powerful man on earth)? (Matthew 4:8-10). 
  Now how curious did this notion of the garden's whereabouts become, especially 
  after we learned that the original name of Plains, Georgia, is <a href="../UsedImages/Carter.gif">Plain 
  of Dura</a>, Georgia, a name derived from the third chapter of the Book of Daniel. 
  (Daniel 3:1). And then, because the garden has traditionally been associated 
  with the eastern regions of ancient Babylon, and the Tigris-Euphrates Valley, 
  and because the Book of Daniel (as well as Ezekiel) was written as a result 
  of the people's captivity in that region in the 6th century B.C., the mystery 
  of the Mystery of Babylon itself began to demand our attention. (Revelation, 
  chapters 17, and 18; Isaiah 13, 14, and 47; Jeremiah 50, and 51) We began to 
  search the Scriptures, and the history of our times in general, for possible 
  connections between these things, to see if there were some timely meanings 
  hidden there. (After all, were not multitudes of people everywhere sensing the 
  signs of the times? and if rightly so, then it follows that the Scriptures must 
  be being fulfilled in light of them. And not having any prior indoctrination, 
  or preconceived notions about how to read the scriptures [Catholics you know], 
  we were free to follow them where they would take us). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We learned that both the prophets Daniel (according to the 
  Hebrew legends) and Ezekiel (the son of man), fulfilled their ministries in 
  Babylon, but were especially caught by such phrases as: <i>Go thy way, Daniel, 
  for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end...</i>(Daniel 
  12:9; Revelation 5:1). And by the fact that Ezekiel himself is chided by the 
  Jews: <i>The vision that he seeth is for many days to come,</i> they said<i>, 
  and he prophesieth of times that are far off.</i> And they, in their own erring 
  ways, were right. Ezekiel responds, however, very cryptically, by saying: <i>Yet 
  the days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.</i>..(Ezekiel 12:22-28). 
  To our minds this passage says: It is true, I am prophesying of times that are 
  afar off, and of things that will come to pass in the West in the last days; 
  but so that you will understand that all things East and West are a reflection 
  of each other, and that the truth of all things resides in the Center, waiting 
  to be discovered, those things that will happen in the West in a great and historic 
  way, will happen right here (or there) in the East in a lesser and more obscure 
  way. And so likewise, those words that we in our time imagine apply only to 
  those ancient times, actually apply to our own… </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Measure the time diligently in itself, and when thou seest 
    part of the signs past, which I have told thee before, </i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then shalt thou understand that it is the very same time, 
    wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which He made. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars 
    of people in the world: </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Then shalt thou understand, that the Most High spake of 
    these things from the days that were before thee, even from the beginning. 
    </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning 
    and an end, and the end is manifest: </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Even so the times of the Highest have plain beginnings 
    in wonders and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs... </font></i><font size="+1">(2 
    Esdras 9:1-6).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <font size="+1">We were especially fortified in this opinion when Ezekiel 
  is commanded to look into the South, into <i>the Forest of the South</i>, and 
  he concludes by saying: <i>Ah Lord God! They say of me, Doth he not speak parables?</i> 
  (Ezekiel 20:46-49). (Matthew 3:10; 7:15-20). We also began to discover the doctrines 
  of the Kabbalah at this time, and learned from this tradition that the Book 
  of Ezekiel, was not to be discussed by one with another unless the other was 
  already versed in the mysteries themselves. We learned that this tradition of 
  secresy reached back to the Essenes who lived even before the time of Christ, 
  and subsequently could see the ways in which these Essenes and their disciples 
  (this <i>Fellowship of the Mystery</i> as they were called), afterwards incorporated 
  this mystery of the Book of Ezekiel and the son of man into the Gospel narratives. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus, from our (un-Traditional--non Kabbalistic) traditional 
  Christian (Catholic) upbringing, with its (un-Traditional) traditionally-orthodox 
  teachings, we were being led into a labyrinth, and into another whole way of 
  studying the Scriptures, into an entirely different tradition, where one book 
  lead to another, and the way outward became inward, and where the world was 
  literally "turned upside down." (Acts 17:6).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We found that this tradition, Kabbalah, which has accompanied 
  the more widely-observed forms of Judaism and Christianity a-cross the times 
  (and for which many have suffered at the hands of the orthodox church), which 
  leads into the broad field of religious and scientific studies, is able to do 
  just this: reconcile the world's religions to each other, religion to science, 
  and everyone to the Universal Mystery of Christ-Metatron, the Angel of Divine 
  Presence, which overshadows the thinking of the whole world. But in the West, 
  where this Presence (the Logos) has descended to inform the human spirit, it 
  is revealed in the figure of the Lamb of God (the Passover Lamb), and in the 
  name Jesus, or Hesus, or <img src="../UsedImages/iesus.gif" width="69" height="14">. 
  All of this will be understood in the following chapters, as we follow all the 
  secret pathways that wind their way through the dimensions of the Oracle--the 
  World Tree--the Tree of Life--into our own times:</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The first questions which 
    the non-kabbalistic reader will ask are: What is the Kabbalah? Who was its 
    author? What are its general teachings? And why is a translation of it required 
    at the present time? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will answer the last question 
    first. At the present time a powerful wave of occult thought is spreading 
    through society; thinking individuals are beginning to awaken to the fact 
    that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in their 
    philosophy; and, last but not least, it is now felt that the Bible, which 
    has been probably more misconstrued than any other book ever written, contains 
    numberless obscure and mysterious passages which are utterly unintelligible 
    without some key wherewith to unlock their meaning. That Key is given in the 
    Kabbalah. Therefore this work should be of interest to every biblical and 
    theological student. Let every Christian ask themselves this question: 'How 
    can I think to understand the Old Testament if I be ignorant of the construction 
    put upon it by that nation whose sacred book it formed; and if I know not 
    the meaning of the Old Testament, how can I expect to understand the New?'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Were the real and sublime philosophy 
    of the Bible better known, there would be fewer fanatics and sectarians. And 
    who can calculate the vastness of the harm done to impressionable and excitable 
    persons by the bigoted enthusiasts who ever and anon come forward as teachers 
    of the people?…What farragos of sacrilegious nonsense have not been promulgated 
    as the true meanings of the books of the Prophets, and the Apocalypse?…(They) 
    have cast down the Sublime and Infinite One from his throne, and in his stead 
    have placed a demon of unbalanced force; (they) have substituted a deity of 
    disorder and of jealousy for a God of order and love; (they) have perverted 
    the teachings of the Crucified One. </font>The Kabbalah Unveiled, by MacGregor

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Very few students of religion 
    know anything at all about the fountain-head whence their tradition springs. 
    Many of them do not even know there is a Western Tradition. Scholarship is 
    baffled by the intentional blinds and defences with which initiates both ancient 
    and modern have wrapped themselves about, and concludes that the few fragments 
    of a literature which have come down to us are mediaeval forgeries. They would 
    be greatly surprised if they knew that these fragments, supplemented by manuscripts 
    that have never been allowed to pass out of the hands of initiates, and completed 
    by an oral tradition, are handed down in schools of initiation to this day, 
    and are used as the basis of the practical work of the Yoga of the West.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The adepts of those whose destiny 
    is to conquer the physical plane have evolved a Yoga technique of their own 
    which is adapted to their special problems and peculiar needs. This technique 
    is based upon the well-known but little understood Qabalah, the Wisdom of 
    Israel… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original stream of Hebraic 
    mysticism has received many tributaries. We see its rise among the nomad star-worshippers 
    of Chaldees, where Abraham in his tent among his flocks hears the voice of 
    God. But Abraham has a shadowy background in which vast forms move half-seen. 
    The mysterious figure of the great priest-king, 'born without father, without 
    mother, without descent; having neither beginning of days nor end of life,' 
    administers to him the first Eucharistic feast of bread and wine after the 
    battle with the Kings in the valley, THE SINISTER KINGS OF EDOM, 'who ruled 
    ere there was a king in Israel, whose kingdoms ARE 'UNBALANCED FORCE.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Generation by generation we trace 
    the intercourse of the princes of Israel with the priest-kings of Egypt. Abraham 
    and Jacob went thither; Joseph and Moses were intimately associated with the 
    court of the royal adepts. When we read of Solomon sending Hiram, King of 
    Tyre, for men and materials to aid in the building of the Temple we know that 
    the famous Tyrian Mysteries must have profoundly influenced the Hebrew esotericism. 
    When we read of Daniel being educated in the palaces of Babylon we know that 
    the wisdom of the Magi must have been accessible to Hebrew illuminati…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was not until the fifteenth 
    century, when the power of the Church was beginning to show signs of weakening, 
    that men dared to commit to paper the traditional Wisdom of Israel. Scholars 
    declare that the Qabalah is a mediaeval forgery because they cannot trace 
    a succession of manuscripts, but those who know the manner of working of esoteric 
    fraternities know that a whole cosmogony and psychology can be conveyed in 
    a glyph which means nothing to the uninitiated. These strange old charts could 
    be handed on from generation to generation, their explanation being communicated 
    verbally, and the true interpretation would never be lost. When in doubt as 
    to the explanation of some abstruse point, reference would be made to the 
    sacred glyph, and meditation thereon would unfold what generations of meditation 
    had ensouled therein. It is well known to mystics that if one meditates upon 
    a symbol around which certain ideas have been associated by past meditation, 
    they will obtain access to those ideas, even if the glyph has never been elucidated 
    to them…'by mouth to ear.' </font>The Mystical Qabalah, by Dion Fortune<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p> <font size="+1">If we strike a direct line from where we now believe the lower 
  garden of Eden to be, here in America, eastward, it arrives in time in those 
  regions of Palestine in the Middle East, the very land into which these mysteries 
  were carried in ancient times. And when we lay the lower (Left-hand) side of 
  the World Tree on top of this line, we see that this line now divides two realms 
  from each other: the higher mysteries from the lower. It divides the precincts 
  of that city made of Stone below, and also those pyramids made of Stone in Egypt, 
  from the higher realizations that were hidden above, </font><font size="+1">of 
  which the Stone Tablets and the Law of Moses are also a direct reflection. Nor 
  must we fail to consider the great Pyramids and temple structures that were 
  also built to the West and just below this line in the Americas. All of it together 
  points to those things that were hidden in the higher, transcendent world by 
  those adepts who were spread throughout the earth in those ancient times:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> The material sun reaches its highest point over the land of 
  the pyramids in present-day Egypt, just as the Spiritual Sun (as we shall shortly 
  see) attains its zenith over the center of the Oracle, in the center of Europe. 
  This place at the center of the Oracle is the True Sinai, or Horeb (Exodus, 
  chapter 19), and to see it is to immediately enter into that higher state of 
  mind that separates the lower Egypt and the Egyptians from the true spiritual 
  Israel and the true Promised Land. For the Promised Land is not in the spiritual, 
  or the prophetic, sense land at all, but a promised State of Mind, one that 
  transcends the things of the earth, and the things of this age, and the whole 
  material universe altogether. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Now if the garden of Eden (and the roots of the Tree of Life--the 
  Foundation of this whole epic, historical drama) is really in the West, how 
  did its whereabouts become associated with all those different regions in the 
  East, Assyria, Babylon (Chaldea), and even Ethiopia? And we discover by studying 
  deep into history that the traditions of the ancient religion of Adam (Manu) 
  were brought to these places during the age of the ancient adepts (during the 
  closing centuries of the Atlantean era--the age of the Ten mythical kings: Adam 
  to Noah in the Hebrew texts), along with the names of Western places. Not only 
  were these names and emerging traditions brought to the East and replanted there 
  in Mesopotamia, but they were carried by historical forces into India and sown 
  deep into the historical consciousness of the Vedic peoples. And they were taken 
  down to Egypt and built into the pyramids (not necessarily by those who any 
  longer understood their fullest and highest meanings), The Shemite religion 
  (Semitism) has its roots in the West, and was brought to the East and affixed 
  into the languages and the thinking of the peoples of the East. Like a small 
  stream running into a river, and then to the ocean, so the religion of Adam/Manu 
  (a theological system of developing monotheism), began to fill the world with 
  itself. (The process is not complete yet). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We will not go to great extremes here to explain the differences 
  that exist between the Holy Commonwealth of Israel--the epic Nation comprised 
  of souls from all other nations--and the present-day nations of Britain and 
  America. Some have grossly confused them because they are sojourning through 
  this time in history together. They are as apart as the Holy Spirit in man is 
  from the body it occupies, or as the Higher Mind is from the lower form it occupies. 
  The British founders of the American nation are the spiritual heirs of the sons 
  of Tyre, or Tyrus, their Pheonician forbears who sailed out of ancient Britain 
  and America long before they colonized the Mediterranean Sea; whose historic 
  task it was to guard the old sea-lanes back to Eden. (Ezekiel, chapters 26 to 
  28). The very act of guarding the sea-lanes from the rest of the world was itself 
  a metaphor for the fact that the meanings of the oracles were being concealed. 
  But as the knowledge and significance of these things disappeared from the recollections 
  of those who were charged with keeping them, iniquity appeared. The Phoenicians 
  went from guarding the Mystery of God to guarding their trade routes, and fell 
  from the Light into the Warring Darkness. These are the sons of Darkness, the 
  present leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Modern Atlantis), 
  (1 Thessalonians 5:1-13). Even up to the time of the colonial period we find

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The historic process was involved. The ancient adepts instructed 
  the world, and the world in turn informed the mind of Israel. If one were to 
  study, say, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, by James Frazer, the <i>Greek myths</i>, 
  by Robert Graves, or <i>The Masks of God</i>, by Joseph Campbell, or any other 
  work like these, and compare them to the unfolding elements of these Oral traditions 
  which are based squarely in the Law and the Prophets, they would find them deriving 
  one from another, pagan mythology from Hebrew, thus Hebrew in part from "pagan" 
  again. And by this we mean they would find the structure of these mythologies 
  to be the same, and each to have their origins in the West, in the hidden isles 
  beyond the North Wind. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">What is it then that set the Universal Israel apart from the 
  other nations? Well first let us agree that immediately after the time of Moses 
  and Jehoshua, when the Scriptures say that Israel came up out of Egypt, it disappears 
  from history. Where did it go? Despite its own written record it cannot be found 
  among the other nations until just prior to the Christian era. Nor are the handful 
  of shards that have been found with words or names on them in Palestine sufficient 
  to prove Israel's actual political existence at that time. First of all the 
  written traditions of Israel were indeed being composed against the backdrop 
  of other historical events (even without the participants in these events knowing 
  that they were being included in another story), such as Homer's story of Troy 
  and the Wars of the Hebrew Kings having the same basis of fact in one another 
  (fact embellished throughout with mythological and epic content). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If the history of Israel were literally true as it has come 
  down to us in the Hebrew writings, or rather, if the story was actually centered 
  in Palestine as we suppose it to have been, there should be museums and warehouses 
  filled with its artifacts. The lack of such should suggest that Israel was not 
  a singular power as we understand such things on a political scale, that it 
  was not the Islamic empire that we envision it to be, cutting a bloody trail 
  through the land of Promise and literally destroying all who stood in the way. 
  But rather it was a school of Thought (even in those times), a religious philosophy, 
  whose exploits were performed, not on the literal field of battle but in the 
  field of allegory and metaphor, and whose sword has always been <i>the Sword 
  of the Spirit and the Word of God</i>. (Ephesians 6:10-17; 2 Corinth.10:3-6). 
  But as the hidden meanings of it all were being concealed from the world at 
  large, and as the outer meanings were falling into the hands of ignorant teachers, 
  and warring factions, who could no longer interpret them, this School itself 
  became increasingly attended by fewer and fewer individuals. These adepts in 
  the hidden science of things continued to be those whose minds, through study 
  and communion with God, and by pure love and righteous actions, penetrated the 
  barriers that divided the outer and inner worlds from each other. These were 
  the Sibyls and Rishis and (shaman) prophets of old, and certain scribes, and 
  then later, and to a limited degree, philosophers such as Pythagorus and Plato, 
  the allegorists, and at last that fellowship of Essenes who, gathering it all 
  back together, left us the Qumran writings, and brought to the world that set 
  of Gnostic texts we call the Gospels... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">These latter were the same Merkabah mystics who laid the foundation 
  for such later Kabbalistic works as <i>Sefer ha-Bahir</i>, <i>Sefer Yezirah</i>, 
  and the <i>Zohar</i>. It is all the same tradition, secretly winding its way 
  here and there across the pages of history, from one side of the Oracle to the 
  other, until it reaches all of us here in this generation. What this School 
  possessed was in-sight, as well as epic-sight. They could sense, thus see, the 
  Invisible Presence of God hidden within the fabric of every natural and human 
  event. They could interpret the motions of history, the <a href="../UsedImages/pg168.gif">motions 
  of the spheres</a> as it is. They knew how to reveal and hide truth at the same 
  time, leaving it for others to rediscover when there was need for it. They knew 
  that revelation, like the Tree of Life itself, was alive and organic, and that 
  it would grow up in the heart of humanity at exactly the same rate as history, 
  and in direct proportion to the manner in which the Mind was being prepared 
  to receive it. They also understood that there was a Light side and a Dark side 
  to this mystery, and that both had to achieve their own perfection before all 
  things could be fulfilled. This School possessed the additional gifts of Wisdom 
  and Understanding, of Love and Power, of Endurance (or Victory), and in the 
  end, when the true Messiahs appear, the gift of Majesty, as Paul wrote: <i>For 
  Messiah is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth...</i> 
  (Romans 10:1-4). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Upon the wings of this text concerning Messiah we may leap 
  again from the Hebrew Prophets to Homer, who has naturally gotten the general 
  drift of these things (as it seems the "Greeks" are always doing), and who also 
  sends his hero on a journey to the Western ends of the earth and back, as it 
  is written: <i>Therefore, a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive 
  for himself a kingdom, and to return.</i>..(Luke 19:12). Homer's account, as 
  we study Strabo's account of it, will also place the garden at the Western end 
  of the earth. It will also reveal to the trained mind something of the methods 
  employed by the authors of the Gospels when they committed to that One Body 
  of writings the many things that must be fulfilled here in the West, even though 
  we associate their occurrence with events that seemed to have happened in the 
  East in the time of Christ: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The science of Geography, 
    which I propose to investigate, is, I think, quite as much as any other science, 
    a concern of the philosopher…Wide learning, which alone makes it possible 
    to undertake a work on geography, is possessed solely by those who have investigated 
    things both human and divine-knowledge of which, they say, constitutes philosophy. 
    And so too the utility of geography-and its utility is manifold, not only 
    regards the activities of statesmen and commanders but as also regards knowledge 
    both of the heavens and of things on land and sea…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I say we are right in regarding 
    Homer as the founder of the science of geography…for otherwise he would not 
    have gone to the uttermost bounds of the inhabited world, encompassing the 
    whole of it in his description. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the first place, Homer declares 
    that the inhabited world is washed on all sides by Oceanus, and this is true; 
    and then he mentioned some of the countries by name, while he leaves us to 
    infer other countries by hints…By Erembians he probably means Arabian Troglodytes-whereas 
    he only indicates in general terms the people who live in the far East and 
    West by saying that their countries are washed by Oceanus, for he makes the 
    Sun to rise out of Oceanus and set in Oceanus…As for the people of the West…he 
    declares: 'But the deathless gods will convey thee to the Elysian Plain and 
    the ends of the earth…' And too, the Islands of the Blessed lie to the West. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore Homer makes it plain 
    that the Ethiopians live at the ends of the earth, when he speaks of the 'Ethiopians 
    that are sundered in twain, the farthermost of men.' About the next verse 
    there is a difference of opinion, Aristarchus writing: 'abiding some where 
    Hyperion (the Sun) sets, and some where he rises,' but Crates: 'abiding both 
    where Hyperion sets and where he rises.' FOR THIS TOO, MEANS THAT THE ETHIOPIANS 
    </font>(Genesis 2:13)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> LIVE ON BOTH 
    SIDES OF OCEANUS, BOTH TOWARD THE EAST AND TOWARD THE WEST." </font>The Geography 
    of Strabo, Book I<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Again, the men of Homer's 
    day, in general, regarded the PONTIC Sea a kind of Oceanus, and they thought 
    that those who voyaged thither got beyond the limits of the inhabited world 
    just as much as those who voyaged beyond the Pillars of Hercules; The Pontic 
    Sea (the Black Sea) was thought to be the largest of the seas in our part 
    of the world, and for that reason they appointed to that particular sea the 
    term 'the Pontus' just as they spoke of Homer as 'the Poet.' Perhaps it was 
    for that reason that Homer transferred to Oceanus things that were true of 
    the Pontus…&quot; </font>Book II<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus some things were applied to the West that seemed to have 
  their meanings in the East. But more important is the method itself, and the 
  way it was used by classical and biblical authors when they wrote things seemingly 
  of the East when in reality they were referring to the West. Take the voyage 
  of Jason (a figure of the universal Christ) for instance, in search of the Golden 
  Fleece. What is this fleece but the coat of the Ram, and the covering of Him 
  who is the Father of the Lamb? Why is this fleece golden in color? Because gold 
  is the color of the Sun, and because the ancient mystery of God was hidden in 
  the Face of the Sun, and in the motions of the Sun, from its rising in the East 
  every morning to its setting in the West each evening. </font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Or the story of Prometheus bound hand and foot to a "rock." 
  All of this symbolism can be divined from the Oracle, from the Universal Mystery 
  of Christ on the World Tree. And why was he bound? For bringing Fire to man, 
  that is, for the sins of Adam--for making man to be as gods. (Genesis 3:22-24). 
  This Fire, which comes to earth from heaven, from the Sun, and which burns eternally 
  on the altar in the midst of the Temple of God, symbolizes Divine Wisdom. This 
  knowledge of heavenly things passes from God to humanity, just as one flame 
  is ignited by another. But when Prometheus (along with his brother, Epimetheus, 
  Forethought and Afterthought, who together represent the beginning and the end 
  of the entire epic), passed this Fire indiscriminately on to those who were 
  not yet mentally and spiritually prepared to use it--evil ensued, and the 20th 
  (and now the 21st) century is the great burning effect of it all:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Prometheus, son of Iapetus, 
    surpassing all in cunning, you are glad you have outwitted me and stolen Fire--a 
    great plague to you yourself and to men that shall be. But I will give men 
    as a price for Fire an evil in which they may be glad of heart when they embrace 
    their own destruction.&quot; </font>Hesiod's Works and Days<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They have one love and that 
    is for weapons; ever more horrible are these weapons until they reach for 
    the one that is ultimate. Should they use that</font><b> </b>(which they did…see

    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">So the elements of the entire epic, the fall and redemption, 
  can be seen in the story of Prometheus. But for what reason would Zeus, the 
  Earth-Shaker, Thunderbolt-Thrower (Job 37:5; 1 Samuel 2:10; Psalm 77:18-20; 
  Haggai 2:6,7; Hebrews 12:25-29; Revelation 15:1-4) bind him to a rock in the 
  very farthest reaches of the Pontus, unless it was to both conceal and reveal 
  the fact that the farthest reaches of the Western Ocean (the Atlantic) were 
  meant? Especially since his other brother Atlas was also fated to bear upon 
  the family shoulders the entire burden of the Western world. What are these 
  burdens but <i>the cares of this world</i> (along with <i>the deceitfulness 
  of riches</i>). All of this is the story of Adam, whose fallen sons and daughters 
  gave birth to an age of Giants, or Titans (Genesis 6:1-5), whose stories are 
  all mixed together with the Hebrew story, all of whom are sitting on the thrones 
  of empires and nations, and city-states at this very day. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">While attempting one night to reconcile all these things and 
  the history of Israel as it is recorded in Scripture, with that sliver of land 
  we now call Palestine, which I could not, not even by allowing it to flow over 
  its borders as it seemed to in order to accommodate certain historical events 
  (and it is embarrassing to read the accounts of certain scholars who believe 
  they have it all crammed in there to everyone's satisfaction), nor could I, 
  as I mentioned before, discover anything of substance in the records of surrounding 
  nations to support the scriptural account of Israel's own history…when a very 
  strange and mind-startling thing occurred. While studying a map of the world 
  the continent of Eurasia suddenly appeared to my mind's eye in the form of a 
  dragon, a Great Dragon:</font></p>
