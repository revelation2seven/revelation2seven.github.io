<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The following is redeveloped 
  from letters sent to a Mr. Jalil, in response to his pamphlet entitled <i>Islam 
  Explained</i>, and the other to a Professor of Religious Studies after a visit 
  and lecture by another Professor, a certain Islamic scholar who we shall respectfully 
  call Dr. B:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear Mr. Jalil,</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">While reading your pamphlet, 
  <i>Islam Explained, </i>I came upon your address, Elberton, Georgia. Are you 
  near the <a href="../UsedImages/pg93mysterygaweb.gif">Guidestones</a>? Has the 
  idea reached you yet which also places the lower Garden of Eden in that region 
  on earth where you live?</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg2mapprint.gif" width="650" height="634"></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The garden had to be located 
  somewhere--where both the beginning and the end of the great Adamic cycle joined 
  and came together. Otherwise the Scriptures could not have been fulfilled. All 
  who have completed the Westward journey in these fulness of times (on behalf 
  of all the rest of humanity) have come bearing the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And obey God and the Apostle that ye may obtain mercy. 
    Be quick in the race for forgiveness, and for a Garden whose width is that 
    of (the whole of) the heavens and the earth prepared for the righteous...</font></i><font size="+1">(Sura 
    3.32,33).</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">__________</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">When the scrolls are laid open...When the world on high 
    is revealed. When the blazing Fire is kindled to fierce heat </font></i>(see 
    Ezekiel 20:45-49)<font size="+1"><i>...And when the Garden is brought near.Then 
    each soul shall know what it has put forth...</i>(Sura 81.10-22).</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">__________</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The disciples said to Isa, Tell us how our end will be? 
    Isa said, Have you then discovered the beginning, that you look for the end? 
    For where the beginning is, there will the end be. Blessed is he who will 
    take his place in the beginning; he will know the end and will not experience 
    death...</font></i><font size="+1">(Gospel of Thomas 18).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have been attempting 
  in these letters and commentaries, to fill in the critical historical gaps in 
  the story that is common to all of us in the West, by re-weaving the fabric 
  of legend, myth and reality to each other again. In the attempt, while searching 
  through the historical records, and principally the oral traditions of the ancient 
  world, we have discovered not only the great means by which God has kept these 
  things hidden but the reason why. This so the mind of Darkness (the descendents 
  of the spirit of Cain) could not take hold of the oracles (the structure and 
  the meanings, not only of the Tree of Life but of their own sacred texts) and 
  learn their mysteries. Had they learned them--and they are wonderful to behold--they 
  would have been able to refrain from the great works of Darkness that are being 
  committed in the earth in our time, and the age would not have been able to 
  come to its meaningful and rightful conclusion. The New could not have been 
  born.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one 
    of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take 
    also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden 
    of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">So He drove out the man; and He placed at the East of 
    the garden of Eden Cherubims</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="+1"> 
    </font></i>(these Cherubims represent all of the balanced, as well as opposite 
    principles of nature, the very same principles that also govern our understanding 
    of the Beginning and the End of all things)</font><font size="+1"><i>, and 
    a Flaming Sword, which turned every way, to keep the way of the Tree of Life...</i>(Genesis<i> 
    </i>3:22-24).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Flaming Sword is the 
  Word of God, as it is written: <i>The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word 
  of God</i> (Ephesians 6:17), and, <i>Is not my Word like Fire?</i> (Jeremiah 
  5:14; Deuteronomy 4:24). It keeps the spirit of Darkness away from the meanings 
  of the Tree of Life, while it burns the dross from the eyes of the children 
  of Light. It consumes the mind of Darkness, while it purifies the mind of Light.</font>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The story begins near 
  where you reside (approximately 120 Jubilees, or 120 X 49 = 5,880 years ago), 
  at the dawn of the historical period. It was a time just prior to the <i>Ad</i> 
  and <i>Thamud</i> peoples, when their predecessors (the childen of Cain), were 
  first overspreading the earth with themselves, and with their refusal (their 
  inability) to pay deep attention to the voice of God's messengers, or to pay 
  heed to God's signs. The adepts in the spiritual sciences (the sons and daughters 
  of Light) were also emerging out of the ancient human order, filling the earth 
  with their insights and teachings as well. But so the children of Darkness could 
  not take hold of these teachings, and continue to pervert them as they had already 
  begun to do (From Cain to Nimrod to Pharaoh was the progression), the adepts 
  began to conceal the central-most precepts and tenets of the Holy Science in 
  those peculiar stories, literary forms, and sacred symbols that have come in 
  time to comprise the substance of our sacred Scriptures. They knew that it would 
  require the same measure of Divine inspiration to discover and reinterpret such 
  writings, as it did to formulate them, as it was also written: <i>Let the spirit 
  of the prophets be subject to the prophets</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It was a time when the 
  Invisible Presence of God was being caught sight of, in the conceptual dimensions 
  of reality, in the astrological designs, and, of course, in the unfolding drama 
  of human events. Out of the seeming chaos, and sheer diversity of the natural 
  order, a much higher notion appeared--of the Unity and Oneness of All things. 
  There is only ONE God, and that One God orders all things--the Night and the 
  Day, and therefore the evil as well as the good. How simple it was<i>. All things 
  flow from the ONE</i> (Consider, for instance, the entire 20th century. It was 
  all the terrible work of of God). Thus from those ancient times to the very 
  present time, <i>They</i> (the Heavenly Father and the Divine Mother) have been 
  bringing all things to pass according to the pattern, and in the image of their 
  own thoughts. These ideas lent themselves in time to the formation of symbols, 
  the earliest mathematical principles, but principally geometric symbols and 
  mandalas. The ideas first embodied themselves in the shape of the Circle and 
  Square, the Cross, the Pyramid, and eventually, after concept was added to concept, 
  the entire structure of the Oracle, the Tree of Life, took shape. It comprehends 
  the whole of creation, the birth of the universe, heaven and earth, the physical, 
  emotional, psycho-intellectual and spiritual dimensions of the human life-force, 
  and the history of man. All of these things are encoded and embodied in its 
  design. (They also lent themselves to the words: <i>God is known by the judgments 
  He executes</i>. What ever Nature is doing, what ever humanity is doing, God 
  is doing).</font></p>

  until right after the &quot;flood&quot; (the judgment wars of Noah's time...Revelation 
  17:15; Daniel 9:26), as the adepts of this developing science began to move 
  Eastward as a result of those wars, the entire East became the repository of 
  the Atlantean and Western mysteries, from the Chaldees and Assyria in Mesopotamia, 
  to India, and through Syria to Egypt and Ethiopia, and Arabia. These mysteries 
  reached Arabia after they moved from India, and out of their Vedic form into 
  their emerging in Hebrew forms. And just as the hidden center of this great 
  Mystery was being purposfully kept from the eyes of the world, but whose conceptual 
  whereabouts, nevertheless, were being recorded everywhere throughout the earth 
  in oral traditions, but also in stone and brick, spirals and ziggurats, shapes 
  and forms, so we are told in legend how Abraham and Ishmael came down to Arabia 
  and built the Ka'aba, which has been the sacred focus of every pilgrimage to 
  Mecca ever since. What is this Ka'aba, however? It is a marvellous geometric 
  record, an image in stone as it is (built every so slightly out of perfection), 
  of those things that were not only <a href="../UsedImages/pg738.gif">concealed 
  above</a>, in the center of the World Mystery, but which are now descending 
  again (out of the East, where they have also been hidden), into the field of 
  human consciousness...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The name Solomon is actually 
  ShLoMoH, (Shin-Lamed-Mem-He), a name derived from other elements of the Divine 
  Name--among them Shalom, (Shin-Lamed-Mem), hence a name closer to the English 
  variant, Solomon. ShaLoM includes both the word, as well as the idea of Peace 
  and Perfection, thus the greeting: <i>al-Salam</i>,<i> </i>as well as the name 
  of the Holy City itself. The letter Shin is the numerical equivalent (300) of 
  the words <i>Ruach Elohim</i>. This name is a manifestation of the Divine Presence 
  as it reveals itself in both the Masculine and Feminine principles of the Creation. 
  (Please see the chapter on the Holy Name). The letter &quot;Lamed&quot; is equivalent 
  to 30, and therefore also equivalent to the Five sefirot on the Tree of Life 
  named Love-Power-Beauty-Endurance-Majesty, (4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8), which together 
  also equal 30. These Five make up the composite figure of the Mystery of the 
  Body of Christ on the limbs of the Sacred Oracle. They represent the whole Western 
  state of mind. The letter &quot;Mem&quot; is equal to 40, and to the number 
  of years the children of Israel were made to wander in the wilderness before 
  they could go in and <i>receive </i>the Promise. (It is also equal to the number 
  of days that the spirit of Christ was tempted in the wilderness). And the letter 
  &quot;He&quot; is equal to the number FIVE and the Power of the Strong Right 
  Hand and the Stretched Out Arm of the Lord (Din), under whose guidance, as well 
  as severe correction, the children of Israel have been making their way through 
  the Nations all these centuries:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Fiveness of the Divine 
    Presence does not contradict its Oneness, that is, the Oneness of Being, for 
    it is always the same Presence. The 'Shahada' (There is none but Allah) expresses 
    both points of view, the relative and the absolute, in its very substance. 
    Its letters are crystallized into words which correspond to the degree of 
    hierarchy. But if the words be melted down into the letters they consist of, 
    we find there is nothing among them but Alif, Lam, and Ha, and these are the 
    letters of the Supreme Name.&quot; </font>What is Sufism, Martin Lings<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

  it in the ordinances of Ramadan, which are fulfilled in fugurative images between 
  the hours of sunrise to sunset (and from the period of one New Moon to the next). 
  It is during this period that the Qur'an was revealed (and, in these last times, 
  in which it is also fulfilled):</font></p>

    American lifestyles that sometimes clash with Islamic ones.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The holy month, which will begin 
    tomorrow and end in 29 or 30 days, will be marked the world over by Moslem 
    abstention during daylight hours from food, drink, sexual intercourse </font>(please 
    recall the interpretation of Revelation 14:4, and the meaning of the term 
    &quot;women&quot;),<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> or anything 
    that may lead to a change in the body's composition.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the month of Allah, explained 
    A. Sherif, a member of Huntington's Moslem community. The beginning of Ramadan 
    is announced from the holy city of Mecca as soon as it is believed the moon 
    has reached a thin crescent shape. It ends nearly a month later under the 
    same circumstances...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Observation of the holy month takes 
    place during daylight hours, which Sherif said is particularly difficult on 
    Moslems in the United States because of different beliefs of most Americans 
    in a society where food and refreshments are plentiful...Yet, if a Moslem 
    can dodge those temptations, his or her faith can become stronger, he said...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You develop a feeling about the 
    poor when you hold yourself for a full day, Sherif said. It creates a feeling 
    that you're supposed to help. Too many people talk about helping the less 
    fortunate without actually doing it, he said. </font>(Please compare Isaiah 
    58:3-8)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ramadan does more than help Moslems 
    develop empathy for others, he said. It is a time when Moslems are closest 
    to God. The Koran is being fulfilled this month. It celebrates the delivery 
    of the Koran to Muhammad, a prophet of Allah. He got the message from God 
    that month.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ramadan is also significant because 
    it demonstrates the unity and similar attitudes of all Moslems. The holy month 
    parallels the Jewish Yom Kippur in function and is also similar to the Christian 
    lent...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, during Ramadan, Moslems 
    around the world are supposed to lay down their weapons if they are taking 
    part in any war...There shouldn't be war, really, Sherif said, noting that 
    terrorists who use the name of Islam for their ventures are not representative 
    of the majority of Moslems...Islam is a religion of peace.&quot; </font>The

  Israel's first captivity in Babylon in the 6th century B.C. (which was an image

  in the West is even more intriguing (and ominous--given the things that are 
  unfolding in the world at this present time). When religious scholars read of 
  Abraham's son Ishmael, and of Ishmael's sons, at Genesis 25:12-18, they assume 
  they are reading of the progenitor of those Arab and Bedowin tribes who sprang

  of mind has been divided from itself, between one side of the world and the 
  other, without a true, or agreed upon Center of its own. The waters that lead 
  to life flow from the Naval of Reality which is situated in the Center, in the

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those who controlled the 
  Ka'aba before the rise of Islam used to observe these rituals at a fixed time 
  in the Fall of the year. This was in accordance with the ancient tradition that 
  these things would have their fulfillment where the Sun sets in the West in 
  the last days. The Muslims, overturning almost all the ways of the <i>Unbelievers</i>, 
  reestablished the Lunar calendar as the means of calculating the new rites of 
  Islam. This had an additional cosmic effect. It allowed the months of Pilgrimage, 
  which reach their climax at the Seventh to the Tenth days of the month <i>Zul-Hajj</i>, 
  to travel around the circle of the year, from East to West. Thus the pilgrimage 
  also arrives, and has its ultimate fulfillment at the end of the age in the 
  Harvest season, but now the mind of Islam would arrive with it.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The first of the principal 
    ceremonies of the Pilgrimage is the putting off of conventional garments </font>(the 
    ways of the world)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, to don those 
    of 'Ihram,' the habit which distinguishes pilgrims from all others but permits 
    no distinction one from another. All, high-born and humble, wear identical 
    robes and are reminded that in the eyes of God all men are created equal--and 
    that on the Day of Judgment all will be accountable.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Ihram' is a state of many prohibitions. 
    On taking this garb the pilgrim enters into a period of peace and self-denial. 
    Violence in any form is banned. The pilgrim must abstain from luxuries and 
    ratification of the senses, however legitimate, until the rites of Pilgrimage 
    have been observed and 'Ihram' put aside...It is forbidden for a pilgrim to 
    uproot any growing thing or to cut down a Tree within the Sanctuary of Mecca. 
    Sexual intercourse must cease temporarily and the sexual impulse is to be 
    sublimated.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the days of 'Ihram' there 
    may be no wrangling or argument, no rudeness, no discussion of the opposite 
    sex, and no hunting. Bodily, the pilgrim is to be devoted to the act of Pilgrimage; 
    intellectually, he or she is to be concerned with prayer, aspirations, praise 
    of God, and self-examination.&quot;</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The things that are required 
  of the pilgrim in Mecca during the <i>Hajj</i> are required--in a higher, spirtual 
  way--of the true religious pilgrim all the days of their lives. But how, we 
  might ask, can the true pilgrim observe the ordinances of sexual abstinance 
  and still observe the precept <i>to be fruitful and multiply</i>? Paul knew, 
  as the Holy Qur'an itself, <i>what we knew not</i>. His entire point of view 
  concerning sexual abstinence (1 Corinthians 7:24-38), was based on an epic understanding 
  of the metaphors and allegories contained in sacred writ (in the higher meaning 
  of the terms, <i>woman</i> and <i>wife</i>), which the Qur'an purposefully employs, 
  and of those things that would come to pass at the end of this age. Being a 
  Doctor of the Law (see Sura 5.44-50), he knows that a Male and Female joined 
  together in the highest state of marriage, constitute in their union &quot;one 
  complete being&quot; (<i>one new man</i>); and that in their state of mutual 
  love they reflect the Divine Love that God--Heaven above and Earth below--have 
  for Each Other, for the whole of Their creation and for all of Their children. 
  The epic precepts of the <i>Hajj</i>, therefore, do not refer to relationships 
  between one soul and another (the complete <i>man</i>) when they are consummated 
  and performed in the image of God--in the interest of true Love, and in the 
  interest of engendering Life, but to all other relationships that fall outside 
  of this union.. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Paul's preference in his 
  own lifetime for celibacy (the self-imposed conditions of his own private pilgrimage) 
  must be understood in the context of these higher mysteries--in the idea of 
  the Church Militant and its spiritual struggle (Jihad) against the Darkness 
  of this entire age (which would surely at times require the life of the warrior, 
  and the disruption of normal family life). But particularly in light of his 
  sense of the reality of<i> metempsychosis</i>, or the appearance again of his 
  own spirit, as well as thousands of other in the fulness of these times. Without 
  an understanding of the early Christian sense of reincarnation, neither Paul's 
  writings nor the Gospel texts hold together. They are rooted in this mystery, 
  which in turn is tied directly to the idea of the Second Coming of Christ, as 
  Paul himself says: <i>A crown shall he give me in that day</i>. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Looking into the Oracle, 
  and into the days when the battles would be accomplished, and when the Male 
  and Female principles would be restored to one another again in the Mysteries 
  of Tree of Life (please understand Isaiah 30:26 in this light), Paul could see 
  what was in store for those who would come to spiritual perfection in the last 
  days: the time of True Love. (Please understand 1 Corinthians 2:9-16). It would 
  be a time when every spiritual Soul would begin to be united at last with his 
  or her own true soulmate. They would be united either here in this world, or 
  when each reached the other side. Thus Paul was counseling all who could understand 
  to keep themselves for that day, and to pay attention instead to the holy business 
  at hand, the spread of the Word of God, and of the kingdom of God's Righteousness 
  as it took its rise from one side of the earth to the other. Paul was not against 
  the married state (nor was he caught in the trap of mysogeny as it was later 
  imagined of him, as his personal struggles with sexuality were misinterpreted, 
  and twisted by Romish churchmen such as Augustine in the centuries that followed). 
  He was completely and longingly in favor of it and kept himself for it. He himself 
  was the subject of the words which say: <i>The Kingdom of heaven is like a marriage 
  which a great king made for His son</i>. (Please see the chapter on Elisha ben 
  Abuyah--the Apostle Paul). (In the generations to come the Saffron, or the celibate 
  life, will be for those whose own soulmates have gone on already to the other 
  side. The love between them, one here and the other there, will increase the 
  field of gravity, and the light-spectrum that binds the two worlds one to the 
  other--until both are restored to one another again on the same side). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus Paul, in keeping 
  with the context of the Word, was not averse to employing analogies and metaphors 
  himself, leaving some things to be understood later. Likewise, the state of 
  marriage that the authors of the New Testament are referring to, or rather cautioning 
  against (Revelation 14:4 for instance), has not to do with the conjugal state 
  between a male and female but with the relationship that exists between the 
  spirit of Christ in the world and the religious institutions to which it is 
  attached, or to which it is endeared. The <i>woman</i> in question is Religion 
  itself--the Church <i>herself--</i>as she plays the role of the Great Harlot 
  among the nations of the earth. (Revelation 17:1-6; Ezekiel, chapter 16):</font></p>

  by a tortured succession of clerics and ecclesiastical mysogynists who have 
  stumbled in all of their own personal imperfections over all the literal, and 
  literary elements of the story of Adam and Eve, and thus who have never been 
  able to reconcile themselves with the fullest joys and pleasures of a holy life, 
  or with fully half of God's Presence in the world. But just as the Apostle has 
  born around in his own person the marks of Christ (not to mentions the indignation 
  of thinking females everywhere), so every female bears about in her physical 
  body the sign, or the metaphor if you will, of another reality. According to 
  the higher Law of Correspondances menstruation is a symbol of a barren womb, 
  and applies in the Scriptures to all the factions of the church, almost exclusively 
  ruled over by males, Christian, Jew and Muslim alike, who are barren of an understanding 
  of these times, and who are not laboring with the Divine Mother to bring forth 
  the coming Child of Revelation into the world. (Revelation 12:1.2; Isaiah 66:6-14; 
  1 Thessalonians 5). She (they) has stained the earth with the blood of the saints,

  &quot;men&quot; are the protectors (guardians and correctors) of &quot;women&quot; 
  as stated in Sura 4.34, when taken literally, is one that is clearly subject 
  to <i>Abrogation</i>. It will not stand the test of time, nor the further impulses 
  of Divine Will. It is not that the Prophet misquoted the words that came to 
  him from above (or, from below), he recited them just as he received and perceived 
  them. And the Companions received them just as they perceived them, as they 
  were filtered through their own thoughts--which were still very much subject 
  to the literal misconceptions of those times. And the Muslim world has received 
  these interpretations (in their present literary form), through the many other 
  expositors of the Qur'an since that time, who have placed their own orthodox 
  stamp on the texts, enforcing upon them the extreme masculine tenor that presently 
  defines Islam, which is not easily dissolved. (But this too was the work of 
  Divine Wisdom. How else could Islam serve the purposes of God as it has? The 
  mind of Islam was only just beginning to be drawn up out of the foreboding and 
  barren mental landscape of that place on earth, but by measure and degree, for 
  even after all these centuries it is clear that it will still require the impending 
  world crisis [the apocalypse] to finally draw the mind of greater Islam into 
  the Higher Light. Islam is recognized for its assertions of the truth, and God 
  has made full use of them...but not for self analysis and criticism, for questioning 
  its own relationship to the greater Mystery, and this is what God would have 
  of it now. It is what the Creators would have of all of us)...</font></p>

    hijacked an entire religion. Ms Manji goes much further, saying that Islam

    go back centuries. Her goal is a thorough liberal reform, started by Muslims 
    living in the West.</font></p>

    despite the fact that she produced several witnesses confirming that she was 
    raped, it is my responsibility as a Muslim to speak out,&quot; she said.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While her critics take special 
    offenses at her suggestion that the Koran itself may be flawed, she does not

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Einstein reasoned the 
  existence of the hidden Fourth dimension by accepting reality as was appearing, 
  regardless of how strange, or how much it seemed to defy human logic. Let Islam 
  accept the decree against itself in the same manner. What the Prophet received 
  in a state of trance (from the very same hidden Fouth dimension), was diminished 
  as it mixed with the cold logic of those who put the words to paper, and who, 
  later, with the thought of exacting their own authority over the lives of others, 
  took control of the meanings of the Sacred text as well. But the inner meanings 
  of the texts were never lost, <i>as Allah has guarded things unseen</i>. They 
  remained hidden in the texts themselves, in the spiritual air, and in the hearts

  all that is Feminine in the Nature of God), can feel heartwarmingly and inwardly 
  obliged to look after her husband's reputation, or his wealth, as the commandment 
  says that she shoul, if that same husband is given to treating her like a child 
  (one that may be abused or <i>corrected</i> at will), or like one that needs 
  to be trained? And why would God--All-Wise and All-Knowing, who is both Father 
  and Mother to us all--subject their own daughters to such persons (any longer)? 
  Such literal commandments were given to drive the spiritually discerning mind 
  away from them, <i>Is not My Word like Fire?</i> and to cause the higher mind

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The following is a letter 
  sent to the then-chairman of the Religious Department of Marshall University</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear Dr. Mabee, </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I know you are familiar 
  with the story of the academic who went to visit the sage, who, when invited 
  to tea, found his cup being overfilled by the sage who kept on pouring and pouring, 
  until the academic finally cried: &quot;Why are you pouring tea all over the 
  floor?&quot; The sage replied, &quot;This cup is like your own mind which is 
  so full of its own notions and imperfect perceptions of the world that, until 
  emptied of them, it can receive nothing of value into it.&quot; Until one empties 
  themselves of these imperfections, which are stored primarily in the structure 
  of the ego, they can receive nothing from God, thus nothing of the truly hidden 
  things of reality. In many ways the other night's speaker (we shall call him 
  Dr.B.), as brilliant as he is in the outer course of Islam, is such a one as 
  this. There is a hidden structure to the Cosmos, and to history, which not only 
  reconciles science and religion but all the world's religions to each other 
  as well, and most of all, the sublime things of God to the mind of humanity. 
  But Dr, B's mind is presently closed to it. It is shut up, as are the minds 
  of most academics I have met, behind an aura of polite ethic, and an inert sense 
  of self-importance. (It seems to have something to do with popularity--who would 
  want to lose it?--and with all the tenured comforts and accolades one has accumulated 
  in their career). The good professor was respectfully trying to prosyltize the 
  meeting the other night--not into the sublime inner structure of Islam, which 
  he does not understand, but into its orthodox and purely intellectual and literal 
  imperfections... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">He mentioned that he was 
  a friend of the ex folk singer, Cat Stevans, the present Yusuf Ali, who (of 
  all people), assented to the death sentence of author Salman Rushdie, saying, 
  &quot;If someone defames the prophet, then he must die.&quot; (And he meant 
  it literally at the time). This is a serious imperfection, and it reaches like 
  a cancer into the collective psyche of the fundamentalist religious mind. It 
  cannot discern between the Judicial Nature of God, which flows directly from 
  Karmic Law, and the soft, psychologically and spiritually mature spirit that 
  rises up among the sons and daughters of Light like the gentle waters of Shiloh. 
  These practitioners of the Highest Dharma know that <i>Vengeance belongs to 
  God alone. </i>And neither are the children of Light so obsessed with their 
  religion, or so insecure in their faith, that they fear it cannot stand up to 
  criticism, or that Allah is not capable of defending Their own Name if They 
  so choose, and that they need men to do it for them. And though the <i>vengeance 
  </i> of God is enacted through the agency of natural and human events, it is 
  never physically enacted by the children of Light (these are the teachings of 
  Christ); and it is never enacted, even by God Himself, because of trivial criticisms, 
  or personal moral failings, but in the interest of the greater plan of Creation. 
  And God would have us realize that whenever &quot;punishment&quot; is enacted 
  by religious authorities in God's Name it is always in an atmosphere of self-righteousness, 
  and in the absence of true Mercy and true Love. Heaven (the Highest <i>Ridwan</i>) 
  is forever closed to the mind that has not attained to it--to the mind that 
  still has its hand in the business of punishment, killing and warfare. This 
  is the work of the children of Darkness. (And, of course, none of them have 
  ever been able to really kill another human soul, only their own. Even the spirit 
  of the Prophet himself must return to our time, and reincarnate, to become wholly 
  consistent with the higher mysteries of Islam as they are coming to pass in 
  the world [to see, as it is, what he has wrought]. This is the mystery of <i>The 
  Farthest Lote Tree</i>).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The professor is not versed 
  in the deeper or higher meanings of Islam, which are wholly consistent with 
  the highest principles of Taoism, Vedaism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Christianity, 
  all of which--in their esoteric dimensions--are wholly consistent with each 
  other. Nor is he versed in the full relationship of the Holy Qur'an to the Mystery 
  of Christ, and therefore he is not versed, or even interested, in the epic dimensions 
  of history, and the way history is unfolding in our time (of course this is 
  in keeping with the mystique of Islam itself)...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Sacred Book of Islam 
    is replete with episodes of sacred history. It speaks of people and prophets 
    of old, of battles, rebellions, love and death, of God's forgiveness and punishment. 
    But the Quran, and with it Islam, is singularly indifferent to the merely 
    historical significance of this sacred history. The Quran is not a book of 
    history and is even less concerned with history than the Bible. The sacred 
    history recounted in the Quran is in reality the epic of the life of the soul. 
    The forces of good and evil mentioned in its pages are to be found within 
    ourselves, and even the prophets are the objective and external complements 
    of the inner Intellect, which illuminates the heart and mind of man. To recite 
    the pages of the Quran is to become aware of the history of one's own being, 
    the forces of one's own soul, and the conditions of the journey of life at 
    the end of which stand death and Divine Judgment. It is to see the Will of 
    God in shaping man's destiny and man's own role in weaving the substance that 
    constitutes our being once the journey of life terminates and suddenly we

  of both. It is reflected in the life of the <i>Ummah</i>--the collective consciousness 
  of Islam. It is reflected in the great difference that exists between the &quot;letter&quot; 
  of the Quran which <i>kills</i>, and the Spirit of the Quran which leads to 
  life. (The same criterion exists for the Qur'an as exists for the Torah. It 
  must be read with a wholly spiritual eye). Dr. B. cannot understand how God

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Upon asking Dr.B. and

  Christianity and Islam, which Dr. B. had said was not entirely possible, the 
  other said: &quot;Excuse me, will you.&quot; and Dr. B., after listening politely 
  for a moment or two, said &quot;We have no need of any further revelation, or 
  prophets. Muhammad sealed up the list of the prophets;&quot; and he said that 
  &quot;Islam as it is already revealed superceded all that went before it...final!&quot;

  at the western end of the earth), it was impossible for him to see, that though 
  Muhammad may have been the last prophet of the ancient world to be carried into 
  the Seven heavens and into the future, he could hardly have been the last word 
  on the whole matter, given the present state of the world. But rather, the <i>Rasul</i> 
  (the Sent One), like John the Baptist before him, was a type and a figure of 
  the Word that would descend again in the last days...(Romans 10:14,15; Isaiah

    mission is to stress also the primordial nature of this mission. HISTORY HAS 
    UNFOLDED AND HUMANITY HAS PURSUED ITS PREDESTINED COURSE. THERE HAD TO BE--AND 
    THERE WAS--A RETURN TO THE ORIGIN, insofar as such a return might be possible, 
    at so late a stage in the cycle. Islam identifies itself as the 'Din-Al-Fitrah,' 
    which might be translated as the 'Religion of Primordiality,' or even as the 
    'Original religion.'&quot; </font>Islamic Spirituality, p.366<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If the prophet Muhammad 
  is indeed these things, but it is evident by looking into the world that neither 
  he nor Islam were these things in the prophet's time; then we also reason that 
  in order for these things to be true in the end, either the prophet himself, 
  or the spirit of the prophet must appear again where the circle literally closes 
  in our time. Islam can understand it when it speaks of Muhammad being immersed, 
  or caught up into &quot;the Prophetic Substance&quot; (an extra-dimensional 
  phenomenon within the structure of time and space that some later Islamic doctrinaires 
  attributed to Muhammad alone...see Daniel 12:13). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Again, it can be seen 
  in the dimensions of the Oracle. When we interweave the Egyptian epic--which, 
  for our own prophetic purposes, begins in the time of Aaron and Moses and culminates 
  with the Nation's deliverance from the judgments of America (Genesis 15:13)--with 
  the Babylonian epic, which also culminates in this same deliverance (for America 
  is both modern-day Egypt and modern-day Babylon), then we can also see the intricate 
  connection that exists between the spirits of John the Baptist and Muhammad. 
  (A sense of it emerged during the Middle Ages in the Knights Templar's attachment 
  to a shadowy figure known as Baphomet). Comparing the diagram concerning the 
  &quot;Seven Times&quot; of Daniel 3:19 and 4:16, 23 with the two diagrams that 
  follow it....</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg796.gif" width="525" height="627"></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">...we see that Muhammad, 
  and the rise of Islam, appeared in the Middle East at the same time relative 
  to the mysteries of Babylon as John the Baptist appears in the Oracle relative 
  to the mysteries of Egypt--both of which culminate in the same events that will 
  unfold in America as this age comes to its conclusion, and the new is born. 
  And then--just as it is written that the spirit of Elijah (which was inhabiting 
  the soul of John the Baptist in those times...Matthew 11:9-15) ascended into 
  heaven in a Fiery (Solar) Chariot (becoming itself immersed in the &quot;Prophetic 
  Substance&quot;), to return again just before the end of the age (Malachi, chapter 
  4; Luke 1:62-80; Matthew 17:1-7; 2 Peter 1:16-21)--we can see how both John 
  and Muhammad are joined together in this heaven of spiritual reality, and how 
  both will appear as one where the Sun is setting at the Western ends of the 
  earth. Every aspect of God's great Mystery converges in our time upon the Seventh 
  sefirah on the tree of Life named Endurance. And then it rises again in glory 
  at the Eighth place on the Tree of Life named Majesty.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Besides those in Christianity 
  who associate this Comforter directly with the Holy Spirit Herself (the One 
  who inspires the Comforter), Islamic scholarship explicitly associates the name 
  Muhammad, and therefore the Prophet himself, with the person of this Comforter. 
  It does so, however, without mention of the fact that this name is derived from 
  the words that John the Baptist delivered out of the 40th chapter of Isaiah--also 
  called The Comforter--which words can have no historic effect at all until the 
  end of the age. And so we see there is more to the relationship and the connections 
  between these names:</font></p>

    the New Testament as it now exists, Muhammad is foretold in the Gospel of 
    John...The future Comforter cannot be the Holy Spirit as understood by the 
    Christians, because the Holy Spirit was already present, helping and guiding 
    Jesus. The Greek word translated Comforter is 'Paracletos,' which is an easy 
    corruption of 'Periclytos,' which is ALMOST a literal translation of 'Muhammad,'

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Contentions and divisions 
  among religious groups almost always lead to charges of corrupt, or altered 
  texts, in order to satisfy the (imperfect) reasonings of one group against another. 
  All of our sacred texts have come down to us just as the Spirit intended. As 
  such, these words concerning the Comforter can only have their fullest meaning 
  in the context of all the words of all the prophets that have come down to us--all 
  of which shall merge together to form a single testimony. They shall not only 
  shed a light upon the affairs of the entire age but giving meaning to the final

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To both of these texts 
  (not failing to see how the tenor of one is reflected in the tenor of the other), 
  we will add the words of the Book of Ezekiel. These also belong to the realm 
  of the Prophetic Substance, and one cannot begin to understand the Gospels without 
  seeing how the authors of those texts added their own far-reaching understanding 
  of the Book of Ezekiel into them:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Neither has Dr. B. grasped 
  the crux of this sublime mystery (nor has the greater part of Judeao-Christianity 
  grasped it yet either): that the Jesus Christ of the Gospels was not one single 
  individual person who ever walked about the earth at one single period in time 
  (unless, of course, if by that &quot;single period in time&quot; we mean the 
  entire time that has elapsed between &quot;that time&quot; and our own; and 
  if by &quot;single individual&quot; we mean the entire Body of believers who 
  have lived in the earth from that time to our own). But rather, the Jesus (or 
  Hesus) of the Gospels is but one of God's many revelations of Him and Herself 
  to the world (as is Allah another)--but in this wholly transformative form not 
  simply to humanity but IN humanity. The Mystery of Jesus (Isa) overshadows the 
  entire history of the Western World, and is in itself the means God has provided 
  to awaken the world from the darkness of this age...</font></p>

  <p align="center"><b>I AM THE DOOR</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But more: It is the Angel's 
  revelation of itself in the form of the Perfect Sacrifice. This is the sacrifice 
  each of us are called to make, some in the interest of revelation (if that is 
  our calling), but everyone in the interest of personal transformation, and in 
  the interest of attaining to true righteousness and justice, and most of all, 
  in the interest of true Love. <i>I am crucified unto the world</i> the apostle 
  Paul says, <i>and the world is crucified unto me</i>. As children of Light we 
  must make this sacrifice of ourselves, and particularly must we behave as children 
  of perfect Peace in a time of perfect War. (Hebrews 12:13,14...1 Corinthians 
  1:18-24; 2:5-8; Ephesians 1:17-23...KJV). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The name, Jesus, is another 
  of the glorious names of God--as the name Allah itself--one that embodies all 
  the hidden, old Indo-European aspects of the Hebrew Mystery as they were revealed 
  in the ancient roots and branches of the World Tree. (Please see the chapter 
  on the Name of Jesus). Those who perceived the totality of it in their individual 
  times became as Jesus to their generation, many even giving their lives in conformity 
  with the structure of the Mystery itself (realizing that Life indeed begins 
  at the point of Death). <i>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified 
  are all of one</i>. (Hebrews 2;11). Thus it is in this sense that the Qur'an 
  is correct when it says that Allah (God) has not taken &quot;a son&quot;--one 
  alone. Allah has in fact taken &quot;many sons,&quot; and &quot;many daughters.&quot;</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We will not agree with 
  every interpretaion of Abdulah Yusuf Ali, the author of <i>The Meaning of the 
  Glorious Qur'ani</i>, but we stand with him here where he says: &quot;The end 
  of the life of Jesus on earth is as much involved in mystery as his birth.&quot; 
  Ali, in turn, is derided by the authors of a pamphlet entitled <i>The Errors 
  of Yusuf Ali</i>, who, in their own orthodox, literal, and self-certain (spiritually 
  arrogant) claim to authoritive interpretation, write:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Commenting on the Quranic 
    verses which clearly state that Nabi Isaa (alayhis salaam) (Jesus) was raised 
    unto Allah Ta'la, Yusuf Ali states:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>'The end of the life of Jesus on earth is as much involved in mystery 
      as his birth...There is a difference of opinion as to the exact interpretation 
      of this verse (i.e. the verse in which Allah Te'ala says that Isaa alayhis 
      salaam was not killed, but raised up)...One school holds that Jesus did 
      not die the usual human death, but still lives in the body in heaven; another 
      holds that he did die but not when he was supposed to be crucified, and 
      that his being &quot;raised up&quot; to God means that instead of being 
      disgraced as a malefactor, as the Jews intended, he was on the contrary 
      honoured by God as His Apostle.'</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two schools of thought that 
    Yusuf Ali speaks of...are in fact nonexistent in Islam. Regarding the physical 
    ascension and present life of Isaa...there is no difference whatsoever in 
    Islam. The teachings of Islam are catagoric and unambiguous in this regard. 
    The Holy Quran is explicit in the fact that Isaa...was not crucified nor was 
    he killed, but <a href="../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif">was raised up</a> unto 
    Allah Ta'ala. The Holy Quran and the statements and explanations of Rasulullah 
    Sallallahu Wasallam (Muhammad) leave no doubt whatsoever that Isaa...is living 
    in a body in heaven. </font>(Heaven being that region in the Mind of the Universe 
    that is inaccessible to the lower, literal understandings of men...please 
    see 1 Corinthians 12, and Hebrews 5:10-14)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yusuf Ali thus confuses the unwary 
    in introducing (outside) beliefs into his 'commentary' of the Holy Quran. 
    The Islamic beliefs regarding Isaa...as preached by the Quran and Muhammad 
    are:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1). Isaa...was born without the 
    agency of a human father. </font>(So what does this immediately tell us about 
    the nature and the &quot;person&quot; of Isaa)?<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2). Isaa...was not crucified nor 
    did he die later.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3). Isaa...was raised up Bodily 
    to heaven by Allah Ta'ala.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4). Isaa...lives to this day in 
    the Fourth heaven.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(5). Isaa...will appear on earth 
    later, but during the time of Imam Mahdi. His task will be to slay Dajjaal 
    (Antichrist). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(6). Isaa...will die a physical 
    death and be buried alongside (Muhammad).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Copious evidence in the form of 
    Quranic verses, Ahadith of (Muhammad)...and opinions of the great learned 
    men of Islam, established beyond the slightest shred of doubt that Isaa...is 
    alive and will make a second appearance on earth to die a physical death.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yusuf Ali's statement...is highly 
    inconsistent with the unambiguity of the teachings of (Muhammad). According 
    to Islam there is NO mystery woven around Isaa's birth or departure from the 
    earth. Islam has clearly explained that Isaa's birth was without the agency 
    of a human father </font>(which, of course, would make him beyond doubt a 
    divine figure, a God)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Similarly, 
    Isaa's departure from earth has been clearly explained by Islam, hence there 
    is no mystery. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Islam has clarified all doubts 
    and 'mysteries' which the Christians had woven around Isaa...Therefore it 
    does not behove Muslims to accept 'commentaries' like that of Yusuf Ali and 
    lapse into confusion and doubt as was the case with the Christians.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even though the things 
  that orthodox Muslims proclaim about the Mystery of Christ are true, at a certain 
  level of comprehension, to simply rehearse or proclaim the tenets of the faith 
  does not make them &quot;perfectly clear&quot; (not to the human mind coming 
  to perfection), nor does it negate Yusuf Ali's statement that it is, nevertheless, 
  all steeped in mystery. Ali, in this instance, is like the &quot;learned man&quot; 
  who, when asked to read (interpret) the book, replied: <i>I cannot, for it is 
  sealed.</i> (Isaiah 29:11). The members of this Young Men's Muslim Association 
  are like zealous, spiritually youthful men everywhere who imagine that what 
  little they do know is all that there is to know, or that needs to be known. 
  <i>But without controversy</i>, the other Apostle said, <i>great is the Mystery 
  of Godliness</i>. (1 Timothy 3:16; 2 Tim.2:22-26). And, of course, the Sacred 
  Book says it as well: <i>Be not in haste with the Quran until its revelation 
  to thee is complete</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is obvious from the 
  Qur'an itself, when it speaks of Isa (Jesus) holding forth from the cradle as 
  an infant (Sura 19.27-38), that this Isa is an apocryphal, half-mythical, semi-divine, 
  archetypal figure (and in some descriptions of him, not human at all but fully 
  Divine). And it is obvious for the plain and simple reason that human infants 
  do not only <i>not</i> deliver righteous discourses from the cradle, but flesh 
  and blood human children are NOT born without the agency of a human father. 
  (The magic in the universe, rather, lies in the very wonder of human conception 
  itself). The narrations concerning the life of Isa, whether they be in the Gospels 
  or the Holy Qur'an, are intended to be believed at a very sublime level of human 
  comprehension. They are not, however, intended to be taken literally (in the 
  literal-historical sense of things), but rather to be understood in light of 
  the very complex dimensions of the Mystery itself, and in the context of the 
  very real relationship that exists between the Creator of the Universe, The 
  Divine Word, and the human mind. It is in the life of those who understand this 
  relationship that the perfect human sacrifice is made. <i>Brahman is atman</i>. 
  Einstein's equation says it as simply as it can be said: All matter is energy, 
  invisible Energy, Divine Energy. All is Light. All is God. It is, as Yusuf Ali 
  has stated, a sublime mystery. The mystery of Isa as it reveals itself on the 
  limbs of the Cosmic World Tree reflects this sublimity. It is a reflection of 
  the Divine Nature within every single living being--and, to a perfect degree, 
  within that portion of the collective Human Mind (those individuals) that understand 
  it. <i>Know ye not that Christ is in you?</i></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Till we come in the Unity of the faith, and of the knowledge 
    of the Son of God, unto a Perfect Man, unto the measure of the stature of 
    the fulness of Christ;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and 
    fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, 
    and cunning craftiness, whereby they lay in wait to deceive;</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But speaking the truth in Love, may grow up in him in 
    all things, which is the Head, even Christ (Isa).</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted 
    by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in 
    the measure of every part, making increase of the Body unto the edifying of 
    itself in Love...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ephesians 4:13-16).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those who have come to 
  this Knowledge can see that the Person of Isa (Jesus) is not only both an invisible 
  as well as visible manifestation of Divine Reality, one that reflects itself 
  in the life of every single human soul, but it is an archetypal, collective, 
  and universal figure in which all the ancient gods, myths, legends and stories, 
  and principles of the ancient world are embodied. Thus Isa is the &quot;Son&quot; 
  of God in the very same sense as Humanity itself is the Child of the Universe--removed 
  by steps from the Creator(s) Themselves, and yet still One with Them. Thus Christ 
  is real in every cosmic sense. Christ was present in the soul of Adam, thus 
  present as a <i>man </i>in the earth throughout all the periods of history, 
  from the time of Adam to our own. Thus he was present in the lives of every 
  soul who was also capable of perceiving his presence in the myth of Horus, the 
  son of Osiris and Isis. Christ is definetly real in the figures of Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva 
  and their consorts Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Shakti-Kali (Krishna and Rhada). Thus 
  Christ is exquisitely real in the figures of Abrahma-Isaac-and Jacob and their 
  feminine counterparts. Christ was also real in the Presence of the children 
  of Israel when they came up out of Egypt, and just as real in the figure of 
  the Warring Angel who went before them, and who met them on the way. Christ 
  is real in the lives of every individual who has ever offered their own life 
  in the interest of Truth, or in the cause of true Love. And Christ is just as 
  real in the lives of every other soul, whether they knew it or not, whose lives 
  were required of them in the interest of history and the unfolding of Divine 
  Reality. (He was alive in those who perished, as well as <i>terribly </i>alive 
  in those who flew into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001...Isaiah 
  30:25; Psalm 18:7-10; Isaiah 66:15,16). Christ is intimately alive in the life 
  of His saints and apostles, as Paul himself said: <i>Who removed me from my 
  mother's womb to reveal His Son in me.</i> (Galatians 1:11-16). Christ Jesus 
  is supremely alive in all the events that are unfolding and coming to pass in 
  our very own time (in the Darkness as well as the Light), and is majestically 
  alive in the Messiahs whom God will raise up to us in our time, as it is written: 
  <i>Until you come to the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a Perfect Man. </i>(Ephesians 
  4:13; Genesis 5:1,2). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus it is only in the 
  context of the Mystery of the presence of God in Christ as it is revealed in 
  the dimensions of the Tree of Life (<i>the Highest</i> <i>Ridwan)</i>, that 
  we can understand the Scriptures when they attribute to Jesus in some instances 
  what in other places are attributed directly to God:</font></p>
