  Godhead</i>).</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Jesus said, &quot;Whoever has come to understand the world 
    has found a corpse. And whoever has found a corpse is superior to the world...&quot;</i> 
    (Gospel of Thomas, saying 56).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The Mystery of God was revealed to the world (in the Christian 
  story of initiation) in the form of a corpse, for the very simple, but highly 
  spiritual reason that every spiritual soul must experience the &quot;death&quot; 
  of Christ. It is the "first death," the death of the old nature, the old logic, 
  and the old, literal ways of interpreting scripture and history. Those who have 
  died this first death no longer contend about words and their meanings, knowing 
  how it is the effect-achieved and not the words-used that determine the character 
  of the soul. For, at last, we shall discover that love, indeed, is the fulfillment 
  of the Law. Words convey, but it is the soul that is conveyed.. Dying with the 
  Buddha we achieve the point of nothingness, a clean slate, the extermination 
  of "my own self." Thus Paul says: <i>I am crucified unto the world and the world 
  is crucified unto me.</i> And then awakening in Christ we come alive to a whole 
  new world of many spiritual dimensions, a world of higher meanings, a world 
  of seven heavens, and ten, and to a state of universal God-consciousness. Those 
  who have died this first death can never be impeded by the "second death," the 
  death of the body itself. To these the Doorway to eternity is opened. Love is 
  the key.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus, to the dimensions of the Tree of Life we add the visage 
  of the Cosmic Man, the Universal archetype, the Adam Kademon of the Kabbalists, 
  the Angel of God's Presence (paradoxically, the very God of War himself, of 
  whom we have much more to say in the following chapters...Exodus 23:20-32; 2 
  Thessalonians 1:6-10...KJV), whose own form fills the universe, and in whose 
  invisible cosmic form our own human bodies are created. We will not see an individual 
  being in the physical sense embodied there, but rather the principles, the forces 
  and dimensions of Creation, indeed, the very Mind of God itself, descending 
  into nature, and then to the earth to take up residence in human form. Neither 
  must we imagine the countenance of any one race of humanity, for the Angel of 
  Presence resides equally in every race, every land, and in every individual. 
  But rather, let us see it in terms of the eternally <i>unchanging</i> pattern 
  which Philo Judaeus speaks of in his <i>On The Creation</i>, which God (whether 
  out of necessity or creative self-will, others may argue), both consulted and 
  conformed to in Their descent, and of which Plato refers to in his <i>Timaeus</i>:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;To discover the maker and 
    father of this universe is indeed a hard task </font>(1 Timothy 3:16)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    and having found him it would be impossible to tell everyone about him. Let 
    us return to our question, and ask, which pattern did its constructor work: 
    that which remains the same and unchanging, or that which has come to be? 
    </font>(the Arian controversy)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">… 
    So let us assume that it resembles as nearly as possible that of which all 
    other beings individually and generically are parts, and which comprises in 
    itself all intelligible beings, just as this world contains ourselves and 
    all visible creatures. For god's purpose was to use as his model the highest 
    and most completely perfect of intelligible things, and so he created a single 
    visible living being, containing within itself all living beings of the same 
    natural order.&quot; </font>Plato's Timaeus<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We want to realize that the Mystery of Christ is both larger 
  and older than Christianity itself. But before this we must pay homage to the 
  Divine Mother, and consider Her Holy Presence, as we shall throughout the following 
  chapters of this work. Without Her we cannot begin to comprehend the principles 
  of Creation. She is before them all. She and the Father are One. She has concealed 
  Herself, as we shall come to see, for very specific historical reasons, indeed, 
  in the very interest of the process of Creation itself (She is Creation). But 
  She has always revealed Herself to the wise, and to those who have overcome 
  the literary devices that She Herself has devised. Where is She? She is everywhere. 
  She is the Holy Spirit of God. She has many forms:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It was She, Divine Wisdom, who with the Father, brought forth 
  the Word--the "Son." For no child can be born without both a Father and a Mother. 
  The "Son" is revealed in the universal form of the Angel of Divine Presence, 
  the Metatron of Kabbalistic fame, who reconciles all things above and below. 
  (Exodus 23:20,21; Ex.24:10...Psalm 2). The Angel of Presence is the extension 
  of the first, or otherwise unknowable or incomprehensible Presence of God. It 
  is, according to the descending structure of the Oracle, a &quot;second person&quot;, 
  or second manifestation of Divine Reality. It is the conscious, as well as fructifying 
  and receptive framework of Nature itself--the Logos--<i> Which is his body, 
  the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</i>.. (Ephesians 1:23). <i>In him 
  we live, and move, and have our being.</i>.. (Acts 17:28). The Mother, it might 
  be said, is revealed in Ten dimensions, and the Son in both Ten and Four. The 
  Purely invisible Father, it might be said, hovers over both of them. (The kabbalists 
  have named Him <i>Ain Sof</i>--Nothingness, Beyond Dimension, Beyond Duality, 
  The One who pervades reality in His/Her Infinite Existence). When the Son begets, 
  he himself is a father. (But let us not get entangled in &quot;male&quot; terminology 
  here--it is all metaphor)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All of humanity, then, the child of heaven and earth, is the 
  &quot;third person&quot;, or the third spiritually conscious manifestation of 
  God's Presence in the universe. It is the principal form into which Heaven has 
  descended. The human body, which reveals at its own center an image of the Navel 
  of creation, contains the doorway that leads from the spiritual realm into the 
  natural; and the mind, toward which the moment of conception ascends, taking 
  the higher path along the spinal cortex to the brain, contains the doorway that 
  leads from the natural realm back to the spiritual realm again. This is the 
  central pillar of the Oracle which aligns the Christ-conscious mind with Higher 
  Mind of the Universe itself, which is God.</font></p>

    <font size="+1">We have not, as can be readily seen, depicted the Angel of 
    Presence on the limbs of the Cosmic Tree in the same literal, male form as 
    we are used to seeing in the West, the form of a male Christ crucified (Revelation 
    1:18), because such an image does not reflect spiritual or historical reality--nor 
    physical reality. And it is not the way the first-century adepts viewed the 
    Mystery of Christ:</font> 
    <p><font size="+1"><i>Jesus saw infants being suckled. He said to his disciples, 
      "These infants being suckled are like those who enter the kingdom." </i></font><font size="+1"><i>They 
      said to him, "Shall we then, as children, enter the kingdom?" </i></font></p>
    <p><font size="+1"><i>Jesus said unto them, "When you make the two one, and 
      when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, 
      and the above like the below, and when you make the male and the female 
      one and the same, so that the male be not male nor the female female (in 
      terms of spiritual hierarchy); and when you fashion eyes in place of an 
      eye, and a hand in place of a hand, and a foot in place of a foot, and a 
      likeness in place of a likeness; then will you enter the kingdom.</i>..&quot; 
      (Gospel of Thomas, saying 22).</font> </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Just as God is not Father alone (even though we have called 
  God "Him" for certain metaphorical reasons), so neither is Christ, or the great 
  Angel of Divine Presence, male alone, but both; as Paul says: <i>For as many 
  of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither 
  Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: 
  for ye are all one in Christ Jesus (Hesus-Crishna)...</i>(Galatians 3:27,28). 
  The term "son" was employed by the authors of the sacred Scriptures to represent, 
  first of all the Solar principle of nature, the principle of spiritual potency, 
  or the ability that exists in every soul (whether it be male or female) to impregnate 
  others with the seed of higher understanding. So in conformity with all the 
  dimensions of the Oracle, the very same which the authors of the Gospels consulted, 
  which are an expression in time and space of all spiritual reality, we have 
  depicted the Angel of Presence in his/her true, androgynous form, as it says 
  in the Scriptures: <i>Male and female created He them and called their name 
  Adam </i> (that is, <i>and called their name Christ</i>...Genesis 5:1,2). Where 
  the Scripture says, <i>Let US create man in OUR image </i> (Gen.l:26), it initially 
  refers to both the Father and the Mother whose joint Presence permeates the 
  whole of creation. But in our time it has come to refer to the Father and Mother, 
  along with all those spirits who are at One with them and who are presently 
  and consciously performing Their will in the earth.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This work will also reveal how the lower <a href="SideLinks/TheGarden.htm">garden 
  of Eden</a> was (and still is) situated in the south-eastern corner of the land 
  we now call the United States of America, as it is written: <i>…Set thy word 
  toward the south…and prophesy against the forest of the south field...</i> (Ezekiel 
  20:46). And how when God brought the mind of the Nation-church full-circle back 
  to this ancient place, it was not only to rediscover the dimensions of the Tree 
  of Life (Genesis 2:8-l7; Revelation 2:7), which are rooted deep into the collective 
  historical consciousness of Western man, but to teach us whether over the long 
  course of time we have learned to distinguish the difference between good and 
  evil, between the spirits of Day-light and Night-darkness (Genesis 1:14-16; 
  1 Thessalonians 5:1-28 KJV). The human soul cannot proceed to the next stage 
  of its own social or spiritual development until it has. These lessons, of course, 
  have everything to do with the things that are unfolding everywhere around us 
  in our own time, right here in America.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus we shall see how America, the crowning glory of the whole 
  lower order of fallen man, becomes the age-ending focus of this great spiritual 
  drama. We will see how it is, among an accumulation of biblical epochs brought 
  together, overlapped, and studied as one, Great Mystery Babylon, <i>the kingdom 
  of nations gathered together</i> (Isaiah 13; Revelation l8). America is the 
  original Chaldea, the original Assyria, the original Egypt, and even the original 
  Ethiopia. It is the beginning and the end of all spiritual transgression. (Deuteronomy 
  32). When the people returned to these ancient shores they came bearing the 
  oracles, and the words which say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Have ye not known? Have ye not heard? Hath it not been 
    told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood from the Foundations of 
    the earth?</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i> It is He that sitteth upon the Circle of the earth, and 
    the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens 
    as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i> That bringeth the princes to nothing; He maketh the judges 
    of the earth as vanity. </i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be 
    sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and He shall also 
    blow upon them, and they shall whither, and the whirlwind shall take them 
    away as stubble...</i> (Isaiah 40:21-24).</font></p>

    those who will take their place in the beginning; they will know the end and

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Of course the land was not empty of humanity, nor of the Spirit, 
  only of the recollections of the historical connections that existed between 
  this land and the rest of the ancient world. And yet the recollections were 
  not entirely lost. They were submerged beneath the collective historical consciousness 
  as it were, but preserved in the oral traditions, in the stories of this continent's 
  indigenous peoples, in the myths of Atlantis, and eventually in the sacred scriptures 
  . And it was no small coincidence that the World Olympic Games were held at 
  Atlanta, Georgia, in 1996. God is bringing the history of the entire age to 
  bear upon the events of our time. (Psalm 19:1-6; Ecclesiastes 9:11,12; 1 Corinth.9:24; 
  Hebrews 12:1).</font></p>

  <p align="center"><b>And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of 
    it: The Three branches are Three days....Genesis 40:12).</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">By making use of the epic interpretation of Scripture, and 
  by tracing the history of the oracles back to their roots, we are able to see 
  how those who have arrived at this Western end of the earth, and this fulness 
  of times, are as those who stood at the Foot of the Holy Mountain to behold 
  the terrible countenance of God in ancient time (Exodus 19:9-25; Hebrews 12). 
  The fact is we are those people, as it is written: <i>The Three Branches are 
  three days</i> (Genesis 40:12), and <i>Be ready against the Third Day: for the 
  Third Day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount 
  Sinai</i>. Everything that we see going on in the world, especially from the 
  time of the First World War to the present, is the expressed, and may we add 
  <i>Terrible</i>, manifestation of the Presence of God. (See Exodus 19:11; Matthew, 
  chapter 24).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus to the cosmic dimensions of the Tree we will begin to 
  add the historical. Just as nature expresses itself in the principle of universal 
  duality, the Tao, so the Oracle has two equal sides to it, both emanating from 
  a single common source--from the Supreme Crown which represents the Mind of 
  God itself. The Tree has a male side and a female, a solar side and a lunar 
  (of which we will have more to say as we begin to discover the relationship 
  that exists here in the West between what appears to be two different religions, 
  Christianity and Judaism). And from this principle of duality (the negative 
  and positive polarities of nature) emerges a tri-partate structure--matter appearing 
  in three visible states, solids, liquids, and gases (and a fourth called plasma 
  found in the fiery center of great distant stars, or now in physics laboratories, 
  suggesting the essential and primal unity of all things). Likewise, the human 
  life-force in three corresponding states: body, soul, and spirit (l Thessalonians 
  5:23). Thus the Oracle is divided into three historical periods that also correspond 
  to the Three branches of the Tree of Life. (Please continue to see how the structure 
  of Nature is revealing itself in the structure of history). The first day represents 
  the time in history when Aaron and Moses appeared in the affairs of the children 
  of Israel. These two appear in the scriptures as foretypes of those who would 
  appear later in history on the Second day of this great unfolding drama, at 
  the time of John the Baptist and Paul, when the Lord of Creation (The Lord of 
  the great Universal Mandala) would begin to reveal Him and Herself to the world 
  in the Mystery of Christ. (Ephesians 1:17-23; 3:4-15). (Again, do not imagine 
  the figure of a Male deity, but rather a figure of the Male/Solar principle 
  rising in the East at the time of John the Baptist [Malachi 4:2], and going 
  forth in the Power and the Majesty of Nature itself):</font></p>

    I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he 
    will not pardon Your transgressions: for My Name is in him... </i>(Exodus 
    23:20-24). </font></p>

  <p><font size="+1"><i>And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">There appears to be no female names on the Oracle for those 
  very specific metaphysical and historical reasons, because from those times 
  to our own the Female/Lunar principle of reality has been in occultation. This 
  is the work of Divine Wisdom Herself. For two thousand years, and more, She 
  has allowed the Male principle alone to rule over the affairs of the lower world, 
  so that the world could witness what a world completely out of balance looks 
  like. It is a world full of ignorance and confusion, violence, oppression and 
  injustice…testosterone running wild as it is. But thank heavens, the Mother 
  is descending into our field of consciousness again, and right on time. She 
  is giving birth to Her next Child, an entirely new age (Revelation 12:1,2), 
  one based wholly upon the principles of balance, symmetry, and absolute non-violence. 
  And in the midst of these events we shall witness (and already are) the inexorable 
  return, or reemergence of the Feminine principle to its rightful place in the 
  cosmic order. This anointed one will appear as the Messiahs are revealed in 
  our time at the Eighth emanation on the Tree of Life named Majesty. Thus Moses 
  informed us that if we were faithful to observe our festivals, blowing the trumpet 
  year by year, in the New Moon and in the days appointed, that we would finally 
  come to that one time in history in which all the hidden meanings would unfold, 
  and every solution to the problems of history itself be realized. (Understand 
  Isaiah 61). (We are speaking, of course, of the beginning of the process of 
  restoration, and of the healing of the planet and her many peoples...Isaiah 
  66:6-14).</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Long ago our people believed that

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we celebrated the cycle, we

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there is one more reason to 
    observe the cycle: from the beginning the Jewish people have celebrated the 
    festivals in order to honor the Unity that underlies all life. The very interweaving 
    of the themes of history and nature, the human life cycle and moments of spiritual 
    experience--remind us that in some sense all the realms of life are dancing 
    with each other. The circles of the Sun, and of the Moon; of a single human 
    life between the generations, and an entire people's history of renewal; of 
    every quiet act of newness, birth, creation--all are echoes of One Circle.&quot;

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">To understand it further, and in so doing gain another sense 
  of the mysteries of Nature, one must take into account now the whole Vedic-Buddhist-Judaeo-Platonic-Christian-Kabbalistic 
  notion of <i>metempsychosis</i>, or transmigration through time and space, and 
  reappearance again of certain spirits, at certain times in history. In other 
  words, <i>reincarnation</i>. Such souls reappear, and we are referring now to 
  our own time in particular, out of the transcendent substance of the World Soul, 
  which is God, to help God turn the Wheel of Time itself. The reality of it all

    big with child and laboring to bring forth her twentieth babe, as the Western 
    world counts her progeny; for according to the books, just nineteen of her 
    centenarian brood have lived and died since he appeared to whom all Christians 
    look as the Teacher of the Way to God. The common consciousness of the General 
    Church flows not from the fact that all believe he is the Teacher of the way, 
    but from the faith, He is the Way </font>(the Tao)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    itself.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Will the twentieth century witness 
    the fulfillment of this so-great expectation; can it be said of the present 
    time that the whole creation travaileth together waiting for the manifestation 
    of the sons of God? Never more in the Western world has the general mind been 
    more ripe for the birth of understanding in things religious than it is today; 
    never have the conditions been more favorable for the wise holding of a wide 
    view of the real nature of Christ and the task he is working to achieve in 
    the evolution of his world-faith. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps it may not be so difficult 
    as it appears at first sight, to point to the direction in which the answers 
    to these questions may be to some extent anticipated. That similar phenomena 
    recur in the natural world is the unvarying experience of mankind; that time 
    is the ever-moving image of eternity, and that the Wheel of Genesis is ever 
    turning, is testified to by wiser minds of humanity. Whither, then, should 
    we look in the history of human affairs for phenomena similar to the happenings 
    of these last three hundred years? Whither else more certain than to the history 
    of the times that witnessed the birth of the religion of Christ? The many 
    striking parallels between the social and religious aspects of civilization 
    of that critical epoch and our own times have been sketched by several writers, 
    but no general notice has been given to their endeavors, least of all has 
    any practical lessons been learned from the experience of humanity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The soul of man returns again and

    one of the great doctrines of general religion. If this be so it follows that 
    when similar conditions recur a similar class of souls returns to continue 
    its lessons of experience. (John 21:20-23). It may well be that even many 
    identical souls who were embodied in the early centuries of Christianity are 
    continuing their experience among us today. For why otherwise do the same

<p> <font size="+1">The immediate reaction to these precepts among fundamentalists 
  (literalists), is to cite the words: <i>It is appointed unto men ONCE to die, 
  but after this the judgment...</i>(Heb.9:27). The verse is used, however, without 
  regard for the true scope of the Christ Mystery, or the epic, historic context 
  in which the words are set, or for the other words which say: <i>Let us make 
  man (men) in our image...</i>(Genesis 1:26). None of these things are fulfilled 
  yet. "Man" is still in the process of being created, for we are only now arriving 
  at the full effect of these words in Genesis. As we shall finally see, God has 
  been transmitting, through the substance of historical time, the content of 
  Their Mind into the mind of humanity. The process will be completed, and man 
  will be fully created, only in the aftermath of the final <i>judgment</i> and 
  redemption of this age…</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Where it says, <i>And Enoch also, the Seventh from Adam, prophesied 
  of these, saying, Behold the Lord cometh with Ten thousands of his saints...</i>(Jude 
  14,15), we are to understand that the Lord is He who who has always died in 
  the continuing sacrifice of the thousands upon thousands who have ever offered 
  their lives for righteousness' sake, but who is still alive in the sum and substance 
  of every unfolding human event. And that these <i>ten thousands of his saints</i> 
  are also all alive at this present moment in history, having been prepared across 
  time itself to execute a righteous judgment against the sons of Darkness who 
  are the present (mis)rulers of the affairs of men.</font></p>
<p> <font size="+1">We begin to see, then, how the first adepts in the Christian 
  mysteries understood the nature of the soul, and its passage through time and 
  space, and how they interpreted the import of their own times. They saw them 
  as a reenactment of the time when the children of Israel came up out of spiritual 
  bondage, and into the Promise under the divine guidance of their Captain of 
  the Hosts, Jehoshua. Having access to the oracles, however, and being able to 
  look into the future, they were able to see in their days a preenactment of 
  our time, the great cosmic Third Day, in which all the mysteries of history, 
  and time, are being fulfilled. We are living in the Day of the Lord, and the 
  entire twentieth century is the <i>Porousia</i>, or the manifestation of the 
  Terrible Glory of God. <i> And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I 
  exceedingly fear and quake...</i> (Hebrews 12:21). The day is not complete yet. 
  It is about to end, and the morning of the coming age is about to dawn on the 
  earth, <i>but first the night.</i></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Mention of the Essene hopes 
    of a New Age of glory leads us naturally to some comments on the special theological 
    views of the Essenes that informed their understanding of history and gave 
    to their community its peculiar institutions. The Essenes belong in the center 
    of that movement (known as) apocalypticism. The late visionaries of the Old 
    Testament, notably the author of Daniel, as well as the later Baptist and 
    Christian communities, discovered themselves to be living in the last days 
    of the Old Age, or rather in the days when the Old Age was passing away and 
    the Kingdom of God was dawning. According to apocalypticism, the upsurge of 
    evil powers in the world reflected the last defiant outbreak of cosmic Satanic 
    powers. The gifts of the Holy Spirit manifest in the community of the faithful, 
    adumbrated the age of the Spirit to follow the final war in which the Spirit 
    of Truth and his heavenly armies would put an end to the rule of the powers 
    of Darkness. The constitution of the Essene community was a crystallized apocalyptic 
    vision. Each institution and practise of the community was a preparation for 
    or, by anticipation, a realization of, life in the New Age of God's rule. 
    ON THE ONE HAND, THEIR COMMUNAL LIFE WAS A REENACTMENT OF THE EVENTS OF THE 
    END TIMES, both the final days of the Old Age AND the era of Armegeddon. </font>(An 
    understanding that is reflected everywhere in the Gospel narratives)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    On the other hand, their community, being heirs of the kingdom, participated 
    already in the gifts and glories that were the first fruits of the Age to 
    come. For the apocalypticists of Qumran the key to these future mysteries 
    was At Hand. One had only to read biblical prophecies with the understanding 
    given the inspired interpreter (that is, one who reads with the power of the 
    Holy Spirit) because the secrets of events to come in the last days were foretold 
    by God through the mouth of the holy prophets…</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In apocalyptic exegesis, three 
    principles should be kept in mind. Prophecy openly or cryptically refers to 
    the last days. Second, the so-called last days are in fact (in types and figures) 
    the present, the days of the sect's life. And finally, the history of ancient 
    Israel's redemption, her offices and institutions, are prototypes of the events 
    and figures of the New Israel. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On this basis, the Essene camp 
    in the wilderness found its prototype in the Mosaic camp of Numbers (Numbers 
    2 to 4; 9:15-10:28). The Essenes retired to Qumran to 'prepare the way of 
    the Lord' in the wilderness. As God established His ancient covenant in the 
    desert, so the Essenes entered into a New Covenant on their return to the 
    desert. As Israel in the desert was mustered into army ranks in preparation 
    for the Holy War of Conquest, so the Essenes marshaled their community in 
    battle array and wrote liturgies of the Holy Warfare of Armageddon.&quot;

<p> <font size="+1">We will use the following chapters of this work to demonstrate, 
  precept by precept, how these things are so (how the Gospel narratives--not 
  being historical documents in the modern sense of the word, but supra-historical 
  and prophetic--were written in this very light), and how one is finally brought 
  to a state of wholeness of mind as they penetrate these mysteries, and as they 
  are penetrated by them--to the intended state of Christ-consciousness itself. 
  For this State of Mind is the true Promised Land...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Which is not to say that there is not a geographical element 
  to all of this. Such a realization is critical to our unfolding world-view. 
  It is just that it is not centered in the literal interpretation of the Law, 
  nor in the common view of history. Neither is it centered in the Middle East, 
  or in Palestine, where Zionists and Arab fundamentalists (literalists) are literally 
  destroying themselves and each other over what they believe the Scriptures say.

  Seeing it for ourselves, and then by following the course of the great Solar 
  Mystery of Christ inwards, or upwards into the center of the Oracle as we will, 
  as the children of Israel did in the time of Jehoshua, and as the Essenes eventually 
  did after the advent of John the Baptist, we will discover how the City of David, 
  the very focus of all divine contemplation (Isaiah 27 to 29), is not situated 
  in Palestine at all, as Western scholarship has been led to believe since the 
  3rd and 4th centuries (l Corinthians 11:17 to 2:16), but in the center--not 
  only of the Great Mandala of the Tree of Life, at the place named Beauty, but

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">There is in our time a growing amount of literature on the 
  subject of the Tree of Life, and on its accompanying discipline of study called 
  <i>Kabbalah</i>. The two go hand in hand, reaching back together to the time 
  of the early Church, when the two religions we know as Normative Judaism and 
  Christianity began to assume their present forms. Christianity was born in the 
  cradle of Kabbalah, and Judaism was preserved by it. These many different works 
  bring us up to date on the historical and spiritual development of this whole 
  field of study; in fact it will be almost impossible to follow the paths we 
  have taken on the subject without some recourse to them. But the most comprehensive 
  among them, for this phase of our study, are the several popular works of Gershom 
  Scholem. His primary work entitled <i>Kabbalah</i>, and another entitled <i>The</i> 
  <i>Origins of the Kabbalah</i>, assist us by tracing many of the fundamental 
  precepts of this discipline to the first and second centuries, and to the doctrines 
  of various Christian gnostic sects. These in turn can be traced, not only to 
  the cryptic doctrines of Paul but to the earlier teachings of the Essenes who 
  lived and travelled throughout Europe and the whole Eastern world at that time. 
  The whole period is shrouded in a vast cloud of speculation, and the human currents 
  and crosscurrents of the time were wholly conducive to the synthesis of ideas, 
  not only for putting them together, but for sealing them up again, which is 
  exactly what was done. The World Mystery was wrapped up with Seven Seals and 
  kept from the eyes of all others. We will have more to say on the transmission 
  of these hidden precepts from, say, the early Jewish and Christian Essenes (through 
  such figures as Rabbi Eliezer the Great) to the Pharisees in another chapter, 
  but suffice it to say that the process infused Judaism with a living esoteric 
  tradition that it came in time to believe was exclusively its own. The infusion 
  has not only preserved Judaism into these very times, but it carried with it 
  an understanding of the hidden means by which the two would be reconciled to 
  each other at the end (or at the beginning, whichever you prefer).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Rabbi Shmuel M.

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In Nissan our ancestors were 
    redeemed, and in Nissan they will in the future be redeemed, say our sages 
    (Talmud, Rosh Hashana 11a, Midrash Shmos Rabba 15:11). More specifically, 
    the Geula (Redemption) that started with the exodus from Egypt was incomplete 
    for it was followed by further exile and suffering. But the process of Geula 
    that started then continues till now and will be completed with the coming 
    of Moshiach.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the 'Seder,' the start of Pesach 
    </font>(At the start of Passover...please understand 1 Corinthians 5:7 and 
    Colossians 2:16), <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the emphasis is 
    on the mitzva of the evening, which is to tell how our ancestors were liberated 
    from Egypt. </font>(Please understand 1 Corinthians 10:1-12)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    We conclude this mitzva with the first two chapters of 'Hallel' (psalms of 
    praise)--(Psalms 113, 114)--which refer to God's descent to the low spiritual 
    depths of Egypt in order to raise us up from there to the very heights when 
    we received the Torah at Mount Sinai.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the end of the 'Seder' refers 
    to the future Geula. We pour out a special 'Koso shel Eliyahu,' a cup for 
    Elijah the prophet who will announce that the Geula is here. We go to the 
    outside door to greet him, </font>(or to chase him out of the neighborhood, 
    and to threaten to destroy his books)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    asking God to make this the time to give our people's persecutors their just 
    deserts. Continuing immediately with the last four psalms of 'Hallel,' (Psalms 
    115-118), which start with these words: &quot;Not for our sake, G-d, not for 
    our sake but for the sake of Your Name.' And we conclude the Seder with the 
    words: 'The Coming Year in Jerusalem.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, the first holy day of 
    Pesach emphasizes the original Geula from Egypt, while the last (the Seventh) 
    emphasizes the future Geula. This becomes clearer as the holy day draws to 
    its close:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the Seventh day of Pesach, the 
    anniversary of the splitting of the Sea, the public Torah reading includes 
    the famous Song of Praise (Exodus 15:1-19)...starting with the words 'Oz yoshir'--'then 
    Moshe sang...' Literally, however, the words mean 'he WILL sing'--one of our 
    sages' proofs that the Torah forecasts the future resurrection of the dead 
    that will cilminate in the ultimate Geula. </font>(Please understand Revelation

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Another of Scholem's works, <i>The Mystical Shape of the Godhead</i>, 
  which describes in spiritual, though anthropomorphic terms the form of the Presence 
  of God on the limbs of the Cosmic Tree, supports not only our present view of 
  the Mystery of Christ, but the spiritual world-view of the first Christian mystics, 
  and those who later authored the Gospels. The entire Body of the New Testament 
  writings is Gnostic and Kabbalistic in nature, and was written, not to overthrow 
  the Law and the Prophets, or to succeed them, but to overlay them, and to accompany 
  and interpret them as they took their course out of those ancient times, following 
  the path of the Sun of Righteousness (Malachi 4:2), toward the day in which 
  they would have their full effect, right here in the West in our own time.</font></p>
<p> <font size="+1">The doctrines of the Kabbalah, likewise, reach back to the 
  time of Moses and Aaron who <i>looked this way and that way</i>, into the future 
  and into the past (which, from Moses' point of view in the East lay both in 
  the same direction), and saw, as it were, the great Circle of Genesis, where 
  it began, and where it would end, and everything in between. Thus the doctrines 
  of the Kabbalah reach back to the time when God first created Man, <i>male and 
  female together,</i> in the garden of Eden. It was a moment in history when 
  the mind of humanity first caught a glimpse of the order and principle in creation, 
  of the Unified Presence of God in the fabric of the natural order--in the light 
  and in the darkness. Adam was the first monotheists. It was a sublime moment 
  in time, from which we say the mind of man has fallen. Yet, to which we have 
  also been returning. Only now the moment can last into eternity, for who in 
  their right minds will choose in the future to duplicate the events of this 
  past age, especially as they are being fulfilled in the events of the twentieth-century? 
  Had Adam, we might reason, been able to look clearly into these times there 
  would have been no &quot;transgression.&quot; But neither would we have experienced 
  the great subtle difference that exists between <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i> 
  in the world (in ourselves, that is), and would have virtually remained children 
  forever. We would have no cause to anticipate, nor any hope of entering the 
  age-to-come for there would have been no redemption, and therefore no age coming. 
  Time would have remained linear. But we have come full-circle, a full octave 
  back to the beginning. Such is the state of mind come to full maturity in Christ.

  Try if you can--by looking into the Oracle from our place called <i>Endurance</i> 
  in the West, past the time of John the Baptist and Paul, to the time of Aaron 
  and Moses--to see how Moses was not only a student of the mysteries of Egypt 
  (Acts 7:22), but of the entire Eastern world. It can be seen in the cosmic figure 
  of the Vedic trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva. See how it fits perfectly into 
  the structure of the Oracle, filling the upper, or supernal dimensions of the 
  World Tree. In chapter 4, and in the commentary entitled The Vedic Connection 
  in the addendum to these chapters, we will see how, along with the Hebrew system 
  of thought, the Vedic system also has its source at the Foot, or at the Lotus 
  Feet of the Tree of Life here at the Western ends of the earth. The two systems 
  are anciently the same. (Genesis 11:12).</font></p>

<p> <font size="+1">The image that we experience here corresponds in every way 
  with the description of <a href="SideLinks/Sandalphon.htm">Sandalphon</a>, the 
  great angel of Kabbalistic and Talmudic fame. It was the rabbis' way of referring 
  to the mysteries of the Vedas without having to admit that they were.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Kabbalah is a word meaning "received" or "that which was received." 
  By whom? By the spiritual mind. When Moses came down from the mountain it says 
  that he brought tables of stone written <i>on the one side and the other.</i>..(Exodus 
  32:15,16; Ex.34). We have a stylized, literal view in our minds of two stones, 
  or tablets, joined together perhaps, with five commandments inscribed on each 
  one. But what the Scripture is telling us is that when Moses descended from 
  the mountain, from the height of human understanding, he brought to the world 
  a code of law that had two dimensions to it, an outer and an inner, an exoteric 
  and an esoteric. Just as the invisible God is both hidden and revealed in the 
  visible elements of the natural order, so the underlying, or real meanings of 
  the precepts of the Torah are both hidden and revealed in the letter of the 
  Torah. They are hidden from the mind of Darkness, and revealed to the mind of 
  Light.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Because almost all our constitution 
    depends on the wisdom of Moses, our legislator, I cannot avoid saying somewhat 
    concerning him beforehand…I mean, because otherwise those who read my book 
    may wonder how it came to pass that my discourse which promises an account 
    of laws and historical facts, contains so much of philosophy. The reader is 
    therefore to know that Moses deemed it exceedingly necessary that he who would 
    conduct his life well, and give laws to others, in the first place should 
    consider the Divine Nature, and upon contemplation of God's operations should 
    imitate the best of all patterns, so far as it is possible for human nature 
    to do, and to endeavor to follow after it; neither could the legislator himself 
    have a right mind without such contemplation; nor would anything he should 
    write tend to promote virtue in his readers… </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now when Moses was desirous to 
    teach this lesson to his countrymen, he did not begin the establishment of 
    his laws after the same manner that other legislators did: I mean upon contract 
    and other rites between one man and another, but by raising their minds upwards 
    to regard God, and His creation of the world…I exhort, therefore, my readers 
    to examine the whole undertaking in that view; for thereby It will appear 
    to them that there is nothing therein disagreeable either to the majesty of, 
    or to His love to mankind; for all things here have a reference to the nature 
    of the universe.&quot; </font>The Preface to Josephhus's Antiquities of the

</blockquote>
<p> <font size="+1">Moses came down from the mountain with the tables of the law, 
  inscribed in stone. This is the Written Law, rigid and inflexible as is the 
  heart of those who cling to purely literal meanings, and who continue to do 
  so in defiance of its higher meanings. Then Moses took the mind of Israel aside 
  and said: &quot;THAT is what is written, but THIS is what is meant." He taught 
  Israel the true epic meanings of the Torah; he explained the meaning of &quot;story,&quot; 
  and of its use in preserving and conveying higher, or hidden precepts. He taught 
  them of the literary figures that filled the pages of the Hebrew story, and 
  how they are connected to other stories--how they elevate them, and add to them 
  an epic perspective. He explained the meanings of the archetypes and images, 
  the metaphors and allegories; and then outlined the history of the world and 
  its times, from the past to the future. And he told them that the difference 
  that exists between the two traditions, the inner and the outer, will separate 
  those who are being guided by their own lesser lights, and their own religious 
  or political ambitions in the last days, from those who are being guided by 
  the Holy Spirit of Divine Wisdom. The latter will inherit the world to come. 
  He then committed the whole esoteric tradition, along with all of its secret 
  kabbalistic constructions, to Aaron and his seed:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And he (also) put the breastplate upon him; he also put 
    in the breastplate the Urim and Thummim... </i>(Leviticus 8:8). </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">_____</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And of Levi, he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim (thy 
    Lights and Perfection) be with thy Holy One, whom thou didst prove at Massah, 
    and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah.</i>.. (Ex.17:7). 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">_____</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>(Who have forsaken the things of this world in pursuit 
    of the world to come) </i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>They shall teach Jacob Thy judgments, and Israel Thy law: 
    They shall put incense before Thee, and whole burnt sacrifice </i><font size="3">(themselves)</font><i> 
    upon Thy altar.</i>.. (Deuteronomy 33:8-11).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">In light of the realization that the Feminine Principle has 
  been hiding itself in the statutes of the law (indeed, as one of the Cherubim 
  overshadowing the Ark of the Covenant in the Holiest Place of all), we ask: 
  What are these <i>Thummim</i> and <i>Urim</i>, these lots, these <i>lights and 
  perfection</i>? They represent the authority of the High Priest, to be sure. 
  But that is not all. They represent the authority of his wife, the priestess, 
  as well. For in ancient Israel, in the shadows of the secret, oral tradition, 
  there were priests and priestesses, dedicated to both principles of the One 
  Godhead, thus to both sides of the sacred oracles. (It can be understood in 
  the opening scenes of the recent popular stageplay, Riverdance), but moreso 
  in the words: <i>And he shall take a wife in her virginity.</i>..(Leviticus 
  21:13). This wife is Wisdom herself, or the wisdom that comes with knowing that 
  without her intuitions and insights, and her equal direction (her equal dedication 
  to the law), no sound or meaningful answer, or decision on any issue is possible. 
  Together do they fill the office of priest; and together, in their relationship 
  to each other, do they reflect and interpret the oracles. A "yes" and a "yes" 
  means yes. A "no" and a "no" means no. A "yes" and a "no," or a "no" and a "yes," 
  means that God has not spoken clearly on the matter yet, for the two do not 
  yet see eye to eye. In which case love and submission intervenes, and one, after 
  reflection, yields to the other. (As in the normal case of every successful, 
  and love-filled relationship). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Armed with the higher meanings of the law, Aaron's seed, the 
  priests and the Levites (in the eponymous sense the entire congregation of the 
  people), accompanied the unfolding, and epic story of Jehoshua up into the Promise, 
  becoming the <i>Firstfruits</i> of all of those who would follow after them 
  in the course of time. (See James 1:18). They accompanied the spirit of Jehoshua, 
  not across that geological metaphor of a river in Palestine, but across the 
  Higher Jordan that runs through time itself, up into the center of the Oracle; 
  which also led them, as we shall see in the following chapter, up into the center 
  of Europe. This esoteric tradition was committed in turn to the elders, and 
  passed on from them to the prophets, and to those of the great (Druidical) assembly, 
  and through a succession of others (but also through ultimate disputes, confusions, 
  apostasies, and internecine warfare) until it spilled back out of Europe during 
  the times of the Hebrew Kings, and we pick up the story again in the centuries 
  immediately prior to the time of Christ, where the whole of it became the driving 
  inspiration of that class of individuals known as Essenes, among whom John (Yochannan) 
  the Baptist (a Teacher of righteousness) appeared just prior to the beginning 
  of this age. (In a recent film on the life of Christ, John the Baptist appears 
  as a Celt. The image is timely and fitting. He was a prophet of the Druidical-Hebrew 
  order come down out of Europe preaching throughout all the <i>wilderness of 
  Judea. </i>The <i>Zadokite Document</i> and the several <i>Books of Hymns </i>discovered 
  at Qumran, along with all the other manuscripts found there, are a record of 
  the doctrines and beliefs that descended with him and with others of that order. 
  They were hidden there in caves as a direct reflection of the true library, 
  and the real wealth of written treasures that are hidden in <i>the Cave</i> 
  above--in the center of Europe. See Deuteronomy 32:34 and the text named <i>The 
  Copper Scroll</i> in the Qumran archives. The gatekeepers will open up to the 
  true Anointed Ones).</font></p>
<p> <font size="+1"> Thus the Oral tradition was handed down along the line that 
  leads from Aaron through John the Baptist to the Remnant in our time. The written, 
  literal tradition, however, was also handed down, and was also transmitted for 
  safe keeping, but along that other line on the Oracle--the one that passes directly 
  from the figure of Moses to those who are still charged with its safe-keeping 
  in our own time, as it is written: <i>For those who keep the Fig Tree shall 
  eat the fruit thereof. And those who wait on their Master shall be honored</i>. 
  (Proverbs 27:18). For just as the one line leads to a "remnant" on the "Christian" 
  side of the Oracle (the side of Levi), so the other line on the Oracle leads 
  to a like remnant of Jews in our time (<a href="SideLinks/TheSunandMoon.htm">on 
  the side of Judah</a>), who are keeping the literal Torah intact in a more heartfelt 
  and perfect way than others. It is from this remnant that the Messiahs in our 
  time shall appear. (Daniel 3:21-25). (Please understand Romans, chapter 11, 
  KJV)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">O</font><font size="+1">n the way, however, as we can see, 
  the Literal tradition passed through a crisis point when &quot;Paul,&quot; the 
  most fervent of literalists, breathing venom on those who were being initiated 
  into the Higher mystery by John on the Left side of the Oracle, appears in the 
  story. And then when he, in turn, had to contend with the other Jews and rabbis 
  of his time on behalf of these same higher meanings of the Law which he had 
  first opposed--giving birth in the whole dispute to the age of Christianity 
  itself. And then through another defining moment, as we mentioned before, when 
  the secret traditions of the Kabbalah--(the true and epic meaning of the Law 
  and the Prophets)--passed over to the Pharisees from the teachings of those 
  <i>Merkabah</i> mystics, John (Yochannan) and Simon Peter (Schimeon), with various 
  other figures as go betweens. In the exchange, and now infused with this living 
  mystical tradition, normative Judaism as we know it today began to take form. 
  These are the same doctrines which Judaism rejected in Paul because he was taking 
  them to their most inclusive extremes ( <i>A setter forth of strange gods</i> 
  as they said of him), opening the door to the Gentiles. After all, it was still 
  Judaism's responsibility to keep the literal tradition intact, to set a fence 
  around it as it were, to preserve it into our time--even if Judaism could not 
  interpret the Law itself to perfection (The Mystery was sealed). It was also 
  Judaism's responsibility to stay inside that fence, for to come out, only half 
  way, and not fully, would result as it did in all the confusion that besets 
  the Jewish world today.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus Paul was a (very) chosen figure, and a reflection in his 
  time of those Jews in our time, of whom Paul himself writes: <i>As concerning 
  the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes; but as touching the election, they 
  are beloved for the Father's sake.</i>.. (Romans 11:28). And of whom Luke writes: 
  <i>No man also having drunk old wine straightaway desireth new; for he saith 
  the old is better...</i> (Luke 5:39).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And in defense of Judaism it must also be said, that part of 
  the reason the early rabbis rejected Paul's philosophy was, that just as Eve 
  gave birth to two sons, Cain and Abel, and just as the admonitions against Balaam, 
  and Jezebel, do indeed apply to Christianity (Revelation 2:14, 20), so all the 
  wickedness in the earth was preparing to concentrate itself and come to power 
  in the name of Christ, as Paul himself also said: <i>For the Mystery of Iniquity 
  doth already work...</i> (2 Thessalonians 2:7). It was as Moses said: <i>For 
  he that is hanged is accursed of God. </i>(Deuteronomy 21:22,23; Galatians 3:13). 
  And now we see it, for the whole of it has led to the terrible events of the 
  Twentieth-century. And so those faithful Jews who rejected it did well to reject 
  it. <i>For the Lord knoweth how to graff them back in again</i>. But also in 
  defense of those forms of Judaism that have departed over the years from strict 
  orthodoxy: in their own worldly ways they have opened up avenues between the 
  two faiths, <a href="SideLinks/TalmudSt.htm">Jews and Christians</a>, that would 
  not have otherwise been opened--avenues of love and respect that will be completely 
  opened with the manifestation of the Messiahs. (The relationship between Father 
  Tom Hartman and Rabbi Gelman of The God Squad on Long Island is a most excellent 
  example). God knows the heart of every person.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In all events, however, those who do not interpret the oracles 
  correctly will in the end stumble over their meanings (the entire Scripture 
  is a commentary on the Tree of Life), and will (God forbid) perish in the judgments. 
  It is as Paul came suddenly to realize: <i>The letter killeth, but the Spirit 
  giveth life.</i>.. (2 Cor. 3:6-18). It is also as it says in the Book of Ezekiel, 
  whose pages we will open up here in the West in our own time:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Because they had not executed my judgments </i><font size="3">(my 
    true meanings, as they were expounded by the mouths of the prophets)</font><i>, 
    but had despised my statutes, and polluted my sabbaths </i><font size="3">(again, 
    my true meanings)</font><i>, and their eyes were after their father's idols, 
    </i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Wherefore I gave them statutes that were not good, and 
    judgments whereby they should not live. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And I polluted them in their gifts, in that they cause 
    to pass through the fire</font></i><font size="+1"> <font size="3">(of War)</font></font><i><font size="+1">, 
    all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that 
    they might know that I am the Lord...</font></i><font size="+1"> (Ezekiel 
    20:19-26).</font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Where are these statutes that are not good? They are in the 
  Torah itself, as it is also written: <i>Is not my word like Fire?</i> (Jeremiah 
  23:29). There are precepts in the literal Torah that the child of Light must 
  flee from as they flee from a fire. They are meant exclusively in their literal 
  application for the children of Darkness, such as those ordinances concerned 
  with the selling of daughters, the procuring of slaves, and perhaps most of 
  all the commission of war, all of which contain a higher, esoteric meaning. 
  Thus the text in Ezekiel refers to Israel's historic refusal to hear the prophets. 
  They said to the people that Moses' commandments to make war, and to slay one's 
  enemies, for instance, are purely allegorical, and are not to be obeyed literally. 
  They said that to literally engage others in acts of mortal combat, as all the 
  sons of Darkness do, is to be literally making war against the Presence of God 
  itself. For the Lord who inhabits the sum of all human events is, indeed, a 
  <i>God of War</i> (Exodus 15:33; 1 Samuel 2:10; Isaiah 66:15,16; 2 Thessalonians 
  1:7-9; Revelation 19:11-16), and <i>a Consuming Fire</i> (Deuteronomy 4:24; 
  Hebrews 12:29). Thus Moses said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, 
    that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing </i><font size="3">(I 
    have explained to you all the meanings)</font><i>: therefore choose life, 
    that both thou and thy seed may live </i><font size="3">(see Deuteronomy 30:19)</font>. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the 
    ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be a witness against 
    thee. </i></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, 
    while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the 
    Lord; and how much more after my death?</i> (Deuteronomy 31:26,27; Acts 20:29).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Romans 13:1-7 for instance, must not be read (or disregarded) 
  as do most Christians, from a nationalistic point of view, for nationalism in 
  any form (and Americanism in particular, for we have been redeemed &quot;out&quot; 
  of the nations, not into them), is a grievous sin against the Law and the Prophets. 
  It is the worship of Ba'al. But rather, the text should be read with a mind 
  lifted up, beholding the spirit of the entire age. Be dreadfully aware: God 
  is not an American, and cares very little for it, no more than He cared for 
  any other of the world-empires through which the Holy Nation passed; nor is 
  God a Christian, or a Jew, or a Muslim. God is bigger, and more than all of 
  these things. This conflict between the universal spirit of Right Reason and 
  the fallen spirit of natural men has finally reached the stage of Apocalypse. 
  (And if we have not learned any of the terrible lessons of the First and Second 
  World Wars, we shall indeed perish in the Third). And it is plain to see that 
  those who cannot interpret the oracles correctly are preparing everywhere in 
  the Western world to bring this destruction right down upon their own heads.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">All of these things were concealed by God in the very interest 
  of creation itself, so that the mind of Darkness could not penetrate the meaning 
  of it all, so that it would reveal itself in the end. And had we not seen it, 
  and experienced it for ourselves, in ourselves, the mind of Darkness would have 
  been able to conceal itself and proceed with the mind of Light across the threshold 
  of the coming age, only to set up its booths again. We would soon be purchasing 
  its wares again, and before long it would be enthroned again, in the very same 
  way as it came to power in this great Age of Darkness. (Matthew 13:12-18; Hebrews 
  4:12,13)…</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And it would not appear so readily as a tyrant, or a violent 
  dictator such as Hitler, Stalin, or even Saddam--for these, contrary to all 
  of our common religious instincts and beliefs, are not the evil ones that we 
  have been warned of, and are not to be counted among the sons of Darkness at 
  all. These instead have been terrible instruments of judgment in the Hands of 
  God. But it (the mind of Darkness) would appear in the subtle contradictions 
  of men like Augustine, who gave us a theory of "just war," (not to mention all 
  of the precedents for the Inquisition, and the loathing of both femininity and 
  the sacrament of sexuality), and Thomas Paine, that sly devil, and all those 
  other great names who brought us the American Revolution. (Open the Book of 
  Isaiah during the periods of the American and French revolutions). The Darkness 
  would be realized in the lives of all the other great religious and political 
  leaders of our time who are drawing the people inexorably to the judgment of 
  God and, if possible, the very destruction of their souls. Of course the contradictions 
  are not so subtle now, but blaring:</font></p>

    but gangs of criminals on a large scale? What are criminal gangs but petty 
    kingdoms? A gang is a group of men under the command of a leader, bound by

    agreed convention. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If this villainy wins so many recruits
