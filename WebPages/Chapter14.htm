<p align="center"><font size="+6">Chapter XIV</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+6">William Jefferson Clinton</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="+1">The following are mostly rambling excerpts from a letter written 
  on the morning of William Jefferson, and Hillary Rodham Clinton's inauguration 
  <a href="../UsedImages/theract.gif">as presidents</a> of the United States:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">January 20, 1993...There is probably no more bewildered a figure 
  in America this morning than me. The inauguration is proceeding. My soul is 
  depressed. The Clintons are being showered with the affections and praises that 
  I had imagined for the true Messiahs. The words that should have applied only 
  to that anointed couple (D.V.D.), are being heaped upon the office of the American 
  Presidency--again! Neil Diamond is singing &quot;America...My Country 'Tis of 
  Thee&quot; on the radio at this very minute. Dylan was there the other night. 
  American bombs are reigning down on another people and Dylan was there. It seemed 
  like the whole 60s generation was there. All the leading lights of the civil 
  rights era were there. Was I the only one deranged and lost in this entire land 
  (I thought to myself)? The only one who had it all wrong? It says <i>Come OUT 
  of her my people... </i>doesn't it? Not &quot;press in.&quot; Not &quot;get 
  involved in her affairs.&quot; Everyone was rejoicing, jubilant, hopeful. The 
  evil ones had been turned out of office, but I was weeping, no crying, for my 
  own sins now. This entire work, this entire vision seemed to be dissolving before 
  my own eyes. I expected the Spirit to reveal these things in the time of Jimmy 
  Carter, and then certainly in the time of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. And 
  now time was running away. I expected at any time during the administration 
  of those presidents to hear the Trump sound against America and its ruling elite. 
  The era of Darkness, rather than ending, was continuing. &quot;The Word remains 
  captive. I am a wholly unworthy vessel.&quot; (Those were the plaintive words 
  of a lost and bewildered soul).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">12:02 p.m...The unimaginable has happened. Clinton has taken 
  the oath of office and I am straining to keep my sense of mind. All that ever 
  fit together there seems to have lost its meaning, its direction...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I was listening the following day to the songs, &quot;Beautiful 
  People,&quot; and &quot;Blessed Are,&quot; by Melanie and Joan Baez. My soul 
  was torn, distant, without a place anywhere, and sick thinking of what the words 
  of these songs meant when they were first sung. We (Nan and I), were not flower 
  children but rather in military service during most of the turbulent sixties. 
  In fact, upon taking a discharge after ten years of service (1957-1967), we 
  encountered an antiwar, civil-rights, and counter-cultural movement in the United 
  States that we honestly did not even know existed. We had been living a sheltered 
  military life, with a dearth of mind that amazes me now as I look back upon 
  it, and as I think of the thousands of families feeling so secure in it now. 
  The military state of mind is a religious experience in itself--much like the 
  cult of Sol Invictus in the time of the Roman legions. But we soon discovered 
  that new wind blowing in America (see John 3:3-8) and got caught up (raptured) 
  in it...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like 
    unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; 
    we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For John came neither eating and drinking, and they say, 
    He hath a devil.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">The son of man </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(open 
    the Book of Ezekiel, right here in America in these last times)</font><font size="+1"><i>, 
    came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, 
    a friend of publicans and sinners. But Wisdom is justified of Her children...</i>(Matthew 
    11:16-19).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">...and were even for a brief time caught up in the swirl of 
  idealism that was expressing itself that morning in Washington D.C. It became 
  apparent to us soon enough, however, that the Gospel was our focus, not politics; 
  individual transformation not national redemption--<a href="SideLinks/TheNationCult.htm">not 
  that nation</a> any way. Our path soon took us out of this system of things, 
  and away from these causes (to rethink it all through), because it was becoming 
  increasingly clear that the more responsive the American system seemed to become 
  to the issues of the time--to the issues of human rights, economic injustice, 
  poverty, social reform, and war and peace--the more subtle and deceptive it 
  became. The more it <i>seemed</i> to change the more it actually stayed the 
  same. The old guard was still in charge, the Darkness still ruled. We discovered 
  that the intrigues of politics (of social activism as well), could be as enervating 
  and alluring to the religious mind as those of (illicit) sex, and began to resist 
  them. For others the path led deeper into the system of things, and for many 
  it was with the sincere hope of actually changing it. But it was clear to see 
  that the system (the Great Beast) wasn't changing, only those who were caught 
  in its embrace. They were being co-opted, in ways that they couldn't understand. 
  By lending it their righteous energy as they were, believing somehow that it 
  could be reformed, they were actually feeding the Beast. This great Creature 
  thrives on dissent. The two paths--into the system of things, and out of it--separate 
  the spirit of Antichrist in our time from the spirit of Christ.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Bill Clinton's bible was open to the verse: <i>Be not deceived; 
  God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For 
  he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that 
  soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting </i>(Galatians 
  6:7,8). But if they in Washington that day were reveling in the rituals of Ba'al--in 
  the gross flesh of this present political realm--I (because of all my own deep 
  sins I was sure), found myself reaping what seemed to be the complete dissolution 
  of every expectation, even the loss of my own soul. While attending to the oracles 
  of my own lower nature I had failed to see how these things also had to come 
  to pass. We understand, of course, that the Father of All sees and knows what 
  we cannot, for while the Clinton administration is extraterranious in a sense 
  (almost irrelevant now) to the Number of the Beast (the number Six Hundred Sixty 
  and Six), the 60s generation itself was destined not to fully awaken without 
  an attempt of its own to see what it could do with the world (without God's 
  help); but neither could the world have come to its present state without it. 
  I wrote to some friends that they could disregard this entire vision of things 
  if Clinton became president, while also hoping they would continue watching 
  with me as the times continued to unfold (Carter continued to be the real focus, 
  the ultimate one to whom this Number belonged). This work, then, became not 
  merely an account, or a commentary on the details of the vision itself, but 
  on the means by which such a vision is attained, and maintained. (1 Corinthians 
  1:27-31).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I said at the time that, though the office of the American 
  presidency is the seat of Antichrist, Bill Clinton was not &quot;the&quot; antichrist. 
  By that I also meant that he seemed not to have the <a href="SideLinks/Fascism.htm">fascist</a>, 
  nor <a href="SideLinks/JimmyCarter.htm">over-religious tendencies</a> that will 
  be required of <i>the</i> antichrist(s). He seemed not to be interested in preserving 
  the way things are as Reagan and Bush were. Killing and war were second nature 
  to them. They are murderers, and truly representative of the criminal state 
  of mind that rules America. Clinton, rather (despite the same enormous ego), 
  seemed instead to symbolize this spirit of misguided idealism--one even capable 
  of redemption. He was eager for change. He seemed to possess many of the same 
  values and sensitivities essential to a true religious life, such as were striving 
  to be born (again) in the counter-cultural experiments of the 50s, 60s, and 
  70s. One cannot aspire to the Christ-spirit in our times who has not been touched 
  in all the right ways by those events. It was a time to inhale, to breath deeply 
  of the Divine Spirit that was manifesting Herself everywhere, not only in this 
  land but throughout the world. (One had to experience the whole of Her). It 
  was the time of the Nazarite, a time to get separated. A new order of Essenes 
  was being called into existence. It was a time of great Darkness as well. Clinton 
  was willing to make that compromise with the Darkness, hoping in his own mind 
  to bend it to the will of the new idealism. It all seemed possible. So like 
  Carter before him, he accepted &quot;the deal.&quot; (Matthew 4:8-11). Present 
  reality bears witness to the fact that God will not honor such compromises. 
  God is jealous for Their own agenda, and for the realization of Their own anointed 
  ones. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">America is the culmination and the climax of the entire Western 
  epic. For those on the Left side of the World Tree (the side of Wisdom, Love, 
  and Endurance), the 60s was a time for seeing America for what it really is, 
  as it is written: <i>If that light is darkness, then how great the darkness. 
  </i>It was a time to <i>come out</i>. (Revelation 18). Bill Clinton did not 
  come out. He was led--in the name of Christ, but contrary to the teachings of 
  Christ-- to take upon himself the cares and the burdens of the whole Western 
  world. He was led away by the nationalistic doctrines of the American (Southern 
  Baptist) church itself. How is it written: <i>Two shall be grinding at the mill, 
  one shall be taken, one shall be left</i>. There is the Church in America (She 
  is a stranger and a pilgrim in a strange land), and there is the American church:</font></p>

  <p><b>Although the idea of &quot;civil religion&quot; sheds a lot more light 
    on the doings in Washington this week than the idea of a &quot;secular holiday,&quot; 
    the concept has drawn a long string of comments and criticisms. Some say civil 
    religion threatens to be an anemic lowest common-denominator to substitute 
    for genuine biblical faith. Others worry that civil religion might be little 
    more than national self-worship, a fusion of faith and flag more likely to 
    magnify than expose the nation's failings...</b></p>
  <p><b>(It) was wondered what would happen to America's civil religion if the 
    time came when the central symbol of &quot;God&quot; could no longer generate

<blockquote>
  <p><b>&quot;Seeking solace from his recent political troubles, PRESIDENT CLINTON 
    SAID TODAY THAT HE HAD JUST READ THE ENTIRE BOOK OF PSALMS, 150 hymns that 
    praise God, and often ask Divine relief from sufferings inflicted by enemies. 
    Friends, he said, have faxed him passages from Scripture on a daily basis 
    as a gesture of support and encouragement. During this difficult period a 
    lot of people were giving me different Psalms to read.&quot; Mr. Clinton said. 
    &quot;It was amazing, so I did.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;The communications revolution gives words of power not only to lift 
    up and liberate but the power to divide and destroy as never before--just 
    words--to darken our spirits and weaken our resolve and divide our hearts,&quot; 
    he said at the prayer breakfast, AN ANNUAL EVENT SPONSORED BY HOUSE AND SENATE 
    PRAYER GROUPS, THAT DREW WELL OVER 3,000 POLITICIANS, JUDGES AND OTHERS TO 
    THE WASHINGTON HILTON HOTEL AND TOWERS. Taking a passage from St. Paul's Letter 
    to the Romans (12:17), Mr. Clinton quoted: &quot;REPAY NO ONE EVIL FOR EVIL, 
    but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>Throughout his presidency, and often in periods of political difficulty, 
    Mr. Clinton has never been reluctant to speak out about his religious thoughts 
    and commitments. Last October, he told a gathering of Baptists journalists 
    that he had been reading more religious books than he ever had in his life. 
    He also said that he had read the scriptural passages usually cited by conservatives 
    against abortion, BUT FOUND THEM AMBIGUOUS, at least in terms of guiding a 
    legal response to abortion.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;You know I need the power of God,&quot; he said. He added that religious 
    belief was an important part of his life. &quot;And the same thing is true 
    for Hillary.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Mr. Clinton did not cite any particular Psalms that had touched him. Traditionally 
    attributed to King David, many speak vividly of bitter personal afflictions 
    and call on God for relief. But the President said, &quot;There are a lot 
    of Psalms where David is sort of praying for the strength to be sort of purified 
    in the face of adversity, and in the face of his own failures. Later Mr. Stephanopoulos 
    said the president cited five Psalms as being important to him right now, 
    Psalms 25, 27, 90, 103 and 139. </b></p>
  <p><b>MR. CLINTON ALSO INDICATED THAT HE HAD BEEN READING THE PROVERBS, WHICH 
    IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW THE BOOK OF PSALMS. There are a lot of the Proverbs which 
    talk about the importance of keeping a quiet tongue, and at least not getting 
    in your own way...&quot;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">If Bill Clinton is not an antichrist in the same sense, or 
  to the same degree as those who preceded him into office, he is, nevertheless, 
  an anti-messiah in the sense that--failing to consider, much less take heed 
  of the sign of the times--he put himself and Hillary forward as champions of 
  the people. They imagined in their own hearts, and through their own self-deceptions 
  were able to convince others (and oh how they love the intrigues of office), 
  that they could change what only the government of the true Messiahs can change--the 
  hearts of men, and the institutions of men. Their partial economic measures 
  (compromises), pale insignificant in the face of the full measure of changes 
  God shall enact through the office of the true Messiahs. And like the others 
  before him, he also steals words and phrases from the Scriptures to suit his 
  own purposes, and is just as unconcerned about their full context or their meanings. 
  If he was truly inspired by the Book of Psalms and Proverbs as he says he was, 
  he would have opened their pages, listened to the words and learned their meanings. 
  He would have read the very first psalms...</font></p>

  The Clintons passed from their potential on the Left side of the Tree of Life 
  to the Right side, the side of Power and Majesty, which up to then was being 
  occupied by a violent merchant and military class. He not only sat himself down 
  in <i>the Seat of the Scornful</i>, but he forgot, or perhaps never actually 
  read the words in the Book of Proverbs that warned him of the wiles of the <i>Strange 
  Woman</i>. She is the <i>Apostasy</i>--the apostate American church--which blessed 
  the two of them earlier in life, and set them on their path to power. <i>For 
  her house inclineth to death, and her paths unto the dead.</i> (Proverbs 2:18).

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Bill Clinton is this <i>young man void of understanding</i>. 
  On his famous bus trip to Washington for his first inauguration, he stopped 
  along the route to attend a church service, where in the typical <a href="../UsedImages/pg52print.gif">ways 
  of Balaam</a> the pastor blessed him and sent him on. The topic of the sermon 
  was &quot;Daniel going down to the Lion's Den.&quot; The allusion was intended 
  to encourage Bill Clinton in his resolve to go down to Washington (<a href="../UsedImages/beast.gif">to 
  fight the beast</a>), to stand bold in the face of government itself. It is 
  plain to see that it was Bill Clinton who got devoured instead. If murder was 
  not second nature to him he has partaken of it now. He had, of course, already 
  compromised his soul for political expedience in his enactments of the death 
  penalty in Arkansas. <i>For with what judgment one meets out </i>(in the name 
  of Christ)<i> so shall it be meted unto him.</i> This is a terrible judgment 
  for a so-called Christian nation to bear, much less an individual. If he did 
  not imagine himself really tied to the ethos of commercial, industrial, and 
  military wickedness as a young man, and then as governor, he is immersed in 
  it now. If he was ever a pacifist he has given it up to conduct America's business. 
  Gandhi wrote that &quot;nonviolence is not a garment to be put on and off at 
  will. Its seat is in the heart, and it must be an inseparable part of our very 
  being.&quot; This is a lesson for both Clinton and Carter, and for all those 
  who believe that these are men of peace.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Those who profess to know God should not play loose with the 
  words of God, as the American church does, especially with those that say: <i>Destruction 
  cometh, saith the Lord, and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</i> 
  (Ezekiel 7:25; Ezek. 13). Which is not to say that peace is impossible short 
  of Armageddon. But that nation which calls itself by the Name of God would have 
  to seriously repent and turn their whole minds over to God, not in partial measure 
  but completely, in accordance with the words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Is there still <a href="SideLinks/TheBalances.htm">a measure 
    of wickedness</a> in the house of the wicked? Shall I count them pure with 
    the wicked balances, and a bag of deceitful weights?...</font></i><font size="+1">(Micah 
    6:10,11).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It would require a complete revolution of heart and mind, of 
  thought and action, one that would accomplish by pure spiritual resolve what 
  God has decreed to accomplish by overthrow and destruction...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">I am come to send Fire on the earth; and what will I, 
    if it be already kindled?</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">But I have a baptism to be baptised with; and <a href="SideLinks/StraightPath.htm">how 
    am I straitened</a> till it be accomplished...</font></i><font size="+1">(Luke 
    12:49,50). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It would require a true Jubilee (Leviticus 25:1-13), and a 
  total Day of Release. (Deuteronomy 15:1,2). It would require a New covenant 
  with God, one that recognizes the Presence of God in the sum of ALL natural 
  and human events; a covenant which realizes that every social and economic transaction, 
  indeed, that all human relationships, are a natural extension of God's invisible 
  Presence in the affairs of human kind, and that they must be carried out with 
  the same spirit of vigilance in these matters as the God of Justice requires 
  of us, and with the same love and care for all things that the God of Love has 
  expressed for creation itself. It will be one which realizes that God has spent 
  this entire historic period (the entire age of Adam) demonstrating to the world 
  what a perversion of these relationships looks like, so that it is never repeated 
  again. (Understand Ezekiel 18). It looks and acts like the global economy of 
  our time, and more specifically like the Western capitalistic economy of the 
  United States that is presently driving it--<i>in the Name of God</i>. Even 
  the good that such an economy accomplishes in the Name of God is accounted as 
  evil, because it serves constantly to magnify the evil means by which the good 
  was accomplished. Just as every body is born, grows, reaches the limits of its 
  own physical and intellectual capacities, so has the great age of commercial 
  wickedness come to the end of its own days.</font></p>

  Clinton do more than manipulate Scripture for partisan interests, but actually 
  read it...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>The President (Bush) concluded a defense of the Gulf War with an outrageous 
    application of Matthew 5:14: 'I want to thank you for helping America, as 
    Christ ordained, to be a light unto the world...' And Bill Clinton messed 
    up 1 Corinthians 2:9 just as badly, asserting: 'Our eyes have not seen, nor 
    our ears heard, nor our minds imagined what things we can build.'&quot;</b></p>

<p><b><font size="+1"></font></b><font size="+1">We wish that the American church 
  could actually open up its eyes to see what it has built in God's Name--the 
  walls and the towers of Great Mystery Babylon. The article goes on to quote 
  Jerry Falwell, who it says:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;...was equally correct in saying of Gore and Clinton: 'Manipulating 
    the Holy Scriptures for political purposes should be offensive to millions 
    of Americans who read and believe the Bible, whether they be Democrat, Republican, 
    of Independent.'</b></p>
  <p><b>Such blatant abuse of Scripture should stop. But as always in religion 
    and politics, the issue is not entirely clear. If it is offensive to misquote 
    the Bible wildly, what about quoting the Scriptures accurately (as Clinton 
    did in quoting 'Where there is no vision the people perish.') to make a political 
    point. What about other forms of God-talk to garner support?...</b></p>
  <p><b>In 1992 it is evil when politicians misquote and misapply the Bible. But 
    it is a hopeful sign that so many of them feel a need to pay attention to 
    Scripture. The Bible, regrettably, is all too easy to abuse in political speech. 
    But thankfully it also remains too important for shrewd politicians to leave 
    it alone. Christians should pray that politicians--before they quote its verses 
    and borrow its themes--might actually read the Bible and apply its message 
    of human sinfulness and divine grace to themselves. Only then--if only with 
    great caution--should they exploit its language in the public square.&quot;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">We would that Jerry Falwell, the Christian Right, and the Left, 
  and <i>Christianity Today</i>, and all the Christian capitalists, could apply 
  the deep meaning of Holy Writ and all of its eschatological themes to themselves, 
  in order to more clearly see the thicket that everyone is caught in. We wish 
  they could discern the double-backward meanings of the oracles that they themselves 
  use, which return at last to find everyone who uses them soul-deep in the darkness 
  and the real focus of their own biblical criticisms. We wish that each could 
  take the log from their own eye, in order to see that neither liberals or conservatives 
  pervert the doctrines of Christ any more than the other (both are as narrowly 
  selective in their application of them as the other), and that the American 
  body-politic, to which they are mutually attached, and which both governs and 
  limits their use of the word, is itself the product of a highly corrupt misuse 
  and entirely selective manipulation of the Law and the Prophets to begin with--of 
  which every one must at last give an account. And we wish that these pastors 
  who were blessing Bill Clinton along his triumphant route to Washington could 
  have explained to him the real and epic meaning of the story of Daniel in the 
  Lion's den. It has everything to do with the Nation-church's experience in America 
  in the fulness of these times, as it is written: <i>Be sober, be vigilant; because 
  your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he 
  may devour. </i>(1Peter 5:8). And we wish they could have explained the meaning 
  of the number of the Beast to him; if so the article on the Presidency, in the 
  October, 1992, edition of <i>Time</i> might have struck a timely blow to his 
  own high ambitions. &quot;Two centuries and Counting,&quot; it said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;At 200 years of age, the White House has never been more polished, 
    efficient, renowned as a symbol of Liberty--or more coveted as a residence...George 
    Bush still gets misty-eyed wandering these corridors of history and confesses 
    'I love it here.' Bill Clinton never got over his boyhood handshake with John 
    Kennedy in the Rose Garden--a quasi-religious experience--and he has devoted 
    his whole life to going back there and live...The main thing is to gain both 
    reassurances and inspiration from the fact that you are part of a continuum 
    of national greatness, that you personify the idea for the hopes and dreams 
    and achievements of a great nation.&quot;</b></p>

  Indeed, the most memorable moment in the convention video about the man from 
  Hope was the scene of the eager student being inspired by Kennedy's <i>anointing 
  touch.</i>&quot; I am sure that if Clinton and his advisors could have seen 
  just a few more years into the future they would have had many second thoughts 
  about this &quot;anointing touch;&quot; especially from one that God had destroyed

  Kennedy years, is the focal place of a myth that has itself grown out of the 
  substance of spiritual reality. The myth embodies all of the oral and historical 
  traditions associated with the fulfillment of <i>The Fellowship of the Mystery</i> 
  (Ephesians 3:9). This fellowship, the tradition held, would appear again at 
  the end of the age, not only <i>when</i> the great cycle of time was complete, 
  but also <i>where</i> the great circle was complete...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Naom Chomsky, in a <i>Rolling Stone </i>interview, said in 
  answer to the question: &quot;What do you mean by democracy? What do our rulers 
  mean by democracy?&quot;</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>&quot;Well, like most terms of political discourse, democracy has two 
    quite different meanings. There's the dictionary meaning, and then there is 
    the meaning that is used for purposes of profit and power...In the ideological 
    sense of democracy--the Orwellian sense, in which the word is actually used--a 
    society is democratic if it's run by business sectors that are subordinated 
    to the business sectors that run the United States. If it has that property, 
    it's a democracy. If it doesn't, it is not.</b></p>
  <p><b>So, for example, Guatemala in the early fifties was a capitalist democracy 
    in the dictionary sense of the word. In fact it was one of the most democratic 
    governments in the Third World anywhere. It had lots of popular support...But 
    Guatemala was following policies that the United States did not approve...This 
    was harming the interests of the elements that the United States regarded 
    as the natural rulers--they being the business classes that are linked to 
    U.S. corporations and the military, insofar as they follow U.S. orders. Therefore 
    the United States had to overthrow that government in 1954 to safeguard what 
    it calls democracy.&quot;<font size="+1"></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the American church is caught in a double-deep delusion--the 
  very notion of American democracy. It does not exist in America, only the illusion 
  of it. The spiritual servitude of the people attest to it. For what people in 
  a true spiritual state of mind would continue to elect to itself the haphazardness 
  and confusion, not to mention the injustice and violence, that besets the American 
  way of life--in the name of Christ that is. It is in this context alone that 
  we draw our conclusions. And it is in this context alone that one can see that 
  it is all sheer madness--the whole headlong rush to destruction that the American 
  people are on. There is no expression of democracy in the earth today that is 
  equal to the meaning of it that will be expressed by those who are about to 
  inherit the age to come and the worlds to come. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Path of Christ, which is also the Eightfold Path of Buddhist 
  thought--of which the precepts of Right Thought, Right Relationships, and Right 
  Attitudes toward all others, form a vital part--transcend the idea of democracy 
  itself. The soul that walks this path needs no leaders, for it obeys the Law 
  of Love. And when it requires a leader (a coordinator of our common efforts) 
  it does not choose one from a field of clamoring contenders, none of who presently 
  have a clue as to what is happening in the universe. For power and authority 
  must always be a burden, never an aspiration. Those who seek it must not be 
  entrusted with it. When leaders are required they will not come forward on their 
  own, but will be raised up in true cooperation with the needs of the people 
  themselves. The loving and wise submission that each will show to the other 
  will not only reflect the excellent state of mind that God has been creating 
  in the people, but the relationship that each of us as individuals have in common 
  with God Themselves. (Prophets always appear when these relationships are broken).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">America, which claims to be this enlightened nation in the 
  earth, does so because it has stolen from the higher precepts. It has conscripted 
  what it would from them to further its own natural ends. But from the &quot;meat,&quot; 
  the real substance of the precepts of righteousness and truth, it has abstained. 
  (But even the word &quot;abstention&quot; denotes purpose and resolve. The word 
  we want to use is &quot;incapable.&quot; Of truth and righteousness it is incapable. 
  Such higher virtues come with regeneration, to those who are truly born-again, 
  not to those who merely employ the term, and certainly not to those who disregard 
  the term altogether). The gods of America are Ba'al and Mammon, and a whole 
  pantheon of other fallen notions of spiritual reality. The true nature of its 
  national sentiments and religious beliefs will be evident as God touches it 
  now by Fire.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Scriptures have compared the coming age to the Birth of 
  a Child (Revelation 2:1,2; Isaiah 66:6-9), an event that the American church 
  fail to consider as it falls down on both sides of the very timely abortion 
  issue. The October 28, 1992 edition of the <i>Long Island Catholic</i> said: 
  &quot;The choice has never been clearer...the stakes have never been higher. 
  This year's presidential election will be a life and death decision for millions 
  of unborn children. Their life is in your hands as you vote...Without life every 
  other issue is meaningless.&quot; </font><font size="+1">Those who supported 
  the Reagan-Bush so-called &quot;pro-life&quot; agenda could not have realized 
  how their own champions had, and have, no intention of allowing this Child of 
  Revelation to be born in the earth. (Revelation 12:15; 2 Sam.22:5; Psalm 109:2,3; 
  Romans 3:10-19). In the interest of life those on the Right chose the murderers, 
  the warriors, and the capital punishers. There is no seamless garment of Life 
  in this camp...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The pro-choice people on the Left are just as unmindful. For 
  who in their right spiritual mind would clamor for the right to take a life, 
  unborn yet or not? And Especially in the face of the God of Nature, whose are 
  the treasuries of Life itself? The pro-choice people are mentally and spiritually 
  confused between the right-to-choose and the choices they make. Not to cherish 
  Life in all of its forms, and in all of its potential, is definitely a wrong 
  and mis-guided choice, especially at a time in history such as this is, when 
  all that is not written in the Book of Life is coming to its own fateful end...Which 
  is also why those who choose to abort life must not be condemned or punished 
  by others. The deed carries with it all of its own karmic effects, and its own 
  &quot;punishments.&quot; <i>As the soul thinks, so is it. </i>And yet, like 
  every sin against Life, it also contains within it the seeds of grace, mercy, 
  and forgiveness.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Despite the lofty rhetoric to the contrary, the Clintons' association 
  with the glamour and glitz of American society, in the face of so much injustice, 
  oppression, poverty, and despair, and their failure to separate themselves from 
  the ways of the Corporate State (which seeks constantly to devour the poor, 
  whom God has made rich in faith; and which seeks to devour the land and all 
  of its resources, which God has created for the common blessing of all), reveals 
  the stamp of Ronald Reagan in addition to that of Kennedy upon their lives. 
  In essence, Reagan's dream and his prophecies live on in the Clinton administration, 
  for it was Reagan who set up the Image of the Office of American Presidency 
  again, as Woodrow Wilson did in 1917. The changes the Clinton's imagined they 
  would bring to Washington turned out to be no changes at all; it is still business 
  as usual. Albeit, when Reagan proclaimed a &quot;new beginning,&quot; he implied 
  a return to a more mythical time in American history, a time of unimpeded Darwinism, 
  when might absolutely made right; and when Clinton speaks of a &quot;new beginning&quot; 
  he actually believes that he means &quot;from this time forward.&quot; While 
  there seems to be a substantial difference in their world-views, one moved by 
  the social thrusts of the 60s, and the other against them, they both spring 
  from the same materialistic view of reality--the same American paradigm to use 
  the popular term. It could only <i>appear</i> as if the corporate order was 
  actually responding to the real needs of real people, and only as long as the 
  illusion remained within the context of fiscal accountability and corporate 
  profitability--so long as self-interest <i>actually</i> remained the guiding 
  spirit. It is the wellspring of Adam Smith's treatise <i>On <a href="SideLinks/Capitalism.htm">Capitalism 
  and the Wealth of Nations</a></i>. It seems also to be a tributary of the Clintons' 
  personal ambitions. It is wholly antithetical to the teachings of Christ and 
  to the Law of God:</font></p>

    for the Clintons' ambitions, not the focus of them. If it serves their advancement 
    to take an action that is for the good of the country they will certainly 
    take it. If not, not. This is not for them a difficult choice. It is now merely

  those precepts which warned against consorting with the nations, and with the 
  (other) great men of this age. These are those who, from the time of Constantine 
  to the present, have been allowed to stand in the pulpits of the churches, mosques, 
  and synagogues, to preach their religio-secular sermons and to issue their religio-secular 
  decrees, seeking all the while the means of exercising full authority over the 
  mind of God's people. All who appear in the sacred places where <i>they ought 
  not to be</i>--whether it be the angel of Death sent by God into Vienna in 1938, 
  or the political leaders of our time who are permitted to enter the places of 
  worship and stand in the pulpits--are the &quot;abominations that make desolate.&quot; 
  The Levites (Christianity), and the sons and daughters of Aaron in the midst 
  of them, were commanded to keep such things from happening. (Understand Numbers 
  18). And then we wonder afterwards why every social condition continues to deteriorate,

<p align="center"><b>A NEW YORK EPIC: 1898-1998</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>By David Hinckley</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>LIVE CHEAP. Meet girls. Save the world. With a job description like that, 
    it's no wonder every bus that arrived in New York in 1962 seemed to carry 
    a kid with a guitar, a dream, and a pocket full of folk songs.</b></p>
  <p><b>True, the folk scene of the early 60s was so contentious that if it were 
    the National Rifle Association, they'd have all shot each other. But as folk 
    singers, they tended to have a pacifistic strain, and their interests in matters 
    like world peace was one of several convergent reasons why, in 1962, Greenwich 
    Village had become world headquarters for a folk music scene that, to its 
    own occasional shock and horror, was beginning to matter in the music and 
    popular culture biz.</b></p>
  <p><b>The elements were there. The music industry was between Elvis and the 
    Beatles, and thus poking around for different sounds. The Beat movement of 
    the 50s had left the Village littered with small music venues and hangouts--although 
    Dave Van Ronk later pointed out, it was a misconception that folkies were 
    a different strain of Beats. &quot;Beats hated folk music,&quot; noted Van 
    Ronk. &quot;All these folkniks sitting on the floor singing about the oppressed 
    masses.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>But whatever the bloodlines, the folk scene had hit a stretch where talent 
    was flowing over the banks. Bob Dylan released his debut album in 1962, and 
    while its sales receipts could barely buy him a one-way trip on the Staten 
    Island ferry, by the end of the year he had written <i>Let Me Die in My Footsteps; 
    Masters of War </i>and <i>Blowin in the Wind. </i>The kid seemed to be onto 
    something.</b></p>
  <p><b>Musically what drew the folkies together was an appreciation bordering 
    on reverence for traditional pre-war folk music, which had been resurrected 
    by Harry Smith's <i>Anthology of American Folk Music, </i>and the &quot;rediscovery&quot; 
    down South of wrinkled old blues singers like Mississippi John Hurt, who could 
    still play like the devil even if he had no idea how these young white kids 
    knew or why they cared...</b></p>
  <p><b>What made the Village folk community matter outside its own table, however, 
    was that it had become an important certified sub-group within two larger 
    movements: civil rights and peace. Both these movements valued a folk-music 
    soundtrack: <i>We Shall Overcome</i>, on a picket line; <i>Last Night I Had 
    the Strangest Dream </i>at a candlelight vigil.</b></p>
  <p><b>Agitating for peace in 1962 had nothing to do with Vietnam--</b>(<i>where?</i>)<b>--and 
    everything to do with heading off World War III. The Cuban missile crisis 
    of 1962 was, to peaceniks, just one more chilling indication that someday 
    some jerk with a red button was going to barbecue the world.</b></p>
  <p><b>But if the nuclear-war front looked grim, the civil rights scenario offered 
    hope. Even the federal government, now that the rank injustices of Jim Crow 
    had been ripped too wide open to ignore, seemed to be moving in the right 
    direction. So folkies got together, often in someone's apartment, to argue 
    strategy, work on songs, swap gossip and at the end of the day, more often 
    than not, &quot;get lucky.&quot; </b><b>&quot;Those were not only the days 
    of good music, those were the days of women,&quot; Vince Martin would recall. 
    &quot;It was a rabbit farm.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>The scene included honored veterans like Pete Seeger and Sis Cunningham, 
    who had sung with Woody (Guthrie); younger veterans like Ed McCurdy or Ramblin 
    Jack Elliot...(And) there were the stream of women with long straight hair, 
    like Carol Hester and Joan Baez and Suze Rotolo...</b></p>
  <p><b>Folkies had sold records before; The Weavers, a decade earlier, sold lushly 
    orchestrated sing-alongs like <i>On Top of Old Smokey</i>. Fortunately for 
    their reputation, the Weavers had also been blacklisted during the McCarthy 
    era, which gave them a life-long get-out-of-jail-free card. Peter Paul and 
    Mary had no such protection when, in the summer of 62, they had a top 10 hit 
    with <i>If I Had a Hammer</i>, a bouncy arrangement of a gospel protest tune. 
    They were immediately suspected of harboring commercial ambitions and sellout 
    hearts.</b></p>
  <p><b>Still, the silent thought balloon was now hovering over the whole Village: 
    &quot;If they can get a deal, I can get a deal.&quot; (Of Course) there were 
    always stories in counterbalance: folk singers helping each other with music, 
    wine, a warm bed. Arguments? Families always argue. Besides, there was a feeling 
    in 1962, with assassinations and Vietnam still on the far side of a blind 
    corner, that things just might work out. If you had a guitar and a song, you 
    could find a place to play and sing it, and if you were good, you might make 
    a living at it instead of ever having to work. Love never looked to be more 
    than one introduction away. And, oh yes, you also just might save the world.

<p align="center"><b>By Gail Warner</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>I cannot think of a better time to be twenty-six years old. There was, 
    for example, that night a year ago in Budapest. Sixty of us swayed in a circle, 
    our arms locked around one another's waists, singing. Above us was a full 
    moon; the lights of the city glowed a soft blue and orange below us. It was 
    two in the morning; most of us were exhausted, but no one had any desire to 
    leave. We had gathered from every corner of the planet--from east and west, 
    north and south, from more than twenty countries and every kind of political 
    system and cultural heritage. We spoke more than a dozen languages. But on 
    this night communication posed no problem. As the melodies and languages rang 
    out across the silent, silvery-dewed meadow it became clear that we were celebrating 
    our diversity and our unity at the same time. FOR ONE NIGHT, ON TOP OF A MYSTERIOUS 
    HILL IN CENTRAL EUROPE, WE HAD CREATED THE UNITED WORLD OF OUR DREAMS.</b></p>
  <p><b>The members of the circle were physicians and medical students who had 
    attended a conference sponsored by the International Physicians for the Prevention 
    of Nuclear War, an organization that a few month later would win the Nobel 
    Peace Prize. Whenever I try to define my images of a peaceful world, I invariably 
    think of that spontaneous, late night celebration in the meadow. Each person 
    represented a culture and a particular region of the earth...At the same time 
    we were also a collective organism, moving in harmony and linked by our common 
    dreams, hopes and laughter.</b></p>
  <p><b>Only a few generations before such a gathering of young people from all 
    over the planet would have been a technical and political impossibility. Yet 
    it was only a few generations ago that humans acquired the ability to destroy 
    the earth. OURS IS A TIME OF EXCELERATING EXTREMES. Never before has the danger 
    been so great--never before have the tools available to us to meet that danger 
    been so powerful. With the technology of space-based missile systems has come 
    the technology for global satellite communication. AS THE DARKNESS GROWS SO 
    DOES THE LIGHT: AS THE TOOLS OF DARKNESS ADVANCE, THE TOOLS OF LIGHT ADVANCE 
    IN STEP...</b></p>
  <p><b>The opportunity inherent in the nuclear crisis is that we are being forced 
    as a species to grow up in a hurry. I sometimes think that nuclear arms are 
    part of A GRAND COMING-OF-AGE RITUAL--A TEST TO SEE IF WE CAN MOVE PAST ADOLESCENCE 
    INTO MATURITY. It's a terrifying test, and we may not pass. But it also makes 
    this an exciting vibrant time to be alive...</b></p>
  <p><b>Looking at the world with a 'realistic' eye, there are a few objective 
    reasons for hope. Our president, after great pondering and hoopla, decided 
    in 1985 to advance our country to the brink of 1958, by holding a single summit 
    meeting with the leader of the Soviet Union and signing a cultural agreement 
    that is already in deep trouble because of his administration's refusal to 
    provide any government funding for such exchanges. Star Wars, which may eventually 
    win a historian's prize for the worst idea of the twentieth century, is proceeding 
    apace with the Soviet Union now plunging into its own version of Star Wars 
    research...</b></p>
  <p><b>The crucial step is convincing ourselves that individuals can make a difference...Declaring 
    earnestly that nuclear weapons ought to be junked is clearly not enough. The 
    American public finds itself caught in a dilemma. Few really like nuclear 
    weapons: almost everyone is afraid of them, BUT MANY AMERICANS ARE ALSO DEEPLY 
    AFRAID OF THE ENEMY, COMMONLY REPRESENTED IN OUR TIME BY THE SOVIET UNION. 
    Until the fear of The Enemy is reduced to a more manageable level, rational 
    arguments for arms control, for a nuclear freeze, a comprehensive test ban, 
    and many other sensible proposals are not likely to go far. People have a 
    hard time hearing about the virtues of these arguments while &quot;What about

<p align="center"><b>THE DRAFT--CLUE TO CLINTON CLUELESSNESS</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>(Says) Randall B. Woods</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>In 1992, just before the New Hampshire primary, presidential candidate 
    William Jefferson Clinton became embroiled in a controversy concerning his 
    opposition to the Vietnam War and his evasion of the draft. At the time I 
    was working on a biography of J. William Fulbright, former chairman of the 
    Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a leading dove on the conflict in Southeast 
    Asia and role model to Bill Clinton. Rumor had it that members of Fulbright's 
    staff helped the young Arkansan avoid military service. Those rumors were 
    true.</b></p>
  <p><b>Confronted with the issue, the Clinton camp made public a remarkable letter 
    he had written while at Oxford University in England to his would-be Reserve 
    Officers Training Corps commander. In it, Clinton articulated his opposition 
    to the war but also made it clear that he aspired to high political office 
    and that he recognized the importance of a military record to electoral success. 
    But he chose not to return to the University of Arkansas and fulfill his pledge 
    to enroll in the ROTC. And he managed to persuade his draft board to delay 
    induction for several months until the lottery system went into effect in 
    1969.</b></p>
  <p><b>The South's affinity for things military has been somewhat overdone, but 
    it was and is an important regional characteristic. An examination of the 
    literature on Southern history reveals that a vast disproportion deals with 
    the Civil War. Denizens of the ex-Confederate states were still validating 
    themselves in the 1950s and 1960s through ancestors who had served in that 
    war...So why did Clinton, the product of a region that has traditionally valued 
    soldiering, not go ahead and submit to the draft. If he had wanted to avoid 
    combat assignment, he could then have brought Fullbright's influence into 
    play.</b></p>
  <p><b>And then came the Monica Lewinsky indiscretion and more questions about 
    this enigmatic man--antiwar idealist, calculating politician and insatiable 
    womanizer. Aside from the fact that as a confessed adulterer, the president's 
    actions violate the very military code of conduct his subordinates (he is, 
    after all, the commander-in-chief) are required to adhere to. Is there a connection?</b></p>
  <p><b>Bill Clinton is a pragmatic visionary, a liberal in the best sense of 
    the word. He is possessed of an abiding sense of community, committed to equality 
    of opportunity and fair play for all. His vision of a strong self-reliant, 
    but compassionate America connects him to Lyndon Johnson, Theodore and Franklin 
    Roosevelt, Wooodrow Wilson and the founding fathers...</b></p>
  <p><b>Those credentials (as a sports figure) proved invaluable (to Fulbright). 
    As one of Fulbright's constituents observed during the height of the senator's 
    opposition to the Vietnam War, &quot;How can a Razorback be a Communist?&quot; 
    Lacking these crucial credentials, perhaps Clinton has sought validation as 
    a southern male in sexual conquest. How much better off he and we would be 
    if he had gone out for football at Hot Springs High or gone ahead and enrolled 
    in ROTC. The nation perhaps woulld then have been spared his seemingly endless 
    puberty.</b></p>
  <p><b>Clinton is a man of amazing political instincts and achievments, BUT IN 
    SOME CRUCIAL WAY HE DOESN'T SEEM TO GET IT. Just as he seemed oblivious to 
    the political necessity of &quot;suiting up,&quot; especially for a southerner, 
    HE LATER SEEMED IGNORANT OF THE POWER OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT and the degree 
    to which the media considers the private lives of public figures fair game.</b></p>
  <p><b>Bill Clinton thinks that he is John F. Kennedy...but he is living in the 
    1990s and not the 1960s. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newsday</font><b>.</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It is true, Clinton &quot;did not get it,&quot; but not for 
  all of the reasons Randall Woods imagines. In fact it is Woods himself who is 
  clueless (along with the entire religious right as well). William Jefferson 
  Clinton was as much a child of the 1960s as he was of the American south. And 
  it was at this very time in the history of the nation that the Most High began 
  to separate a generation, as well as a Remnant inside of that generation, calling 
  them through all of the events of those times up out of the American state of 
  mind to which everyone was (and still is) captive. These would be the <i>firstfruits</i> 
  of our times--the elders now of this generation if you will. Bill Clinton, leaning 
  toward that Light on the one hand, but also truly thinking that he could make 
  a political difference in the world, thus toward the Darkness on the other, 
  got caught right in the middle. He, along with so many others, misread the signs 
  of the times, thus with a misguided but wholehearted faith in the agenda, the 
  energies and the social and emerging spiritual aspirations of this generation, 
  went into the system instead of coming out of it as he should have--as we were 
  commanded to--and got eaten up. The point is, however, that these times--this 
  coming into the New Light as it were--were a time of experimentation. After 
  all, who knew what the <i>New</i> was suppposed to look like? It definetly was 
  not supposed to look, or think, or act like anything that went before it--blindly 
  obedient to authority, afraid of love, unfulfilled intellectually, emotionally 
  or spiritually. So it was natural that a time of social and religious experimentation 
  begin (and God allowed for it)--not only with drugs and sex, with new social 
  arrangements, with ideas expressed in word and deed, and in music, yes, the 
  music, but also in the politics of change as well. None of us could see at the 
  time how it was all going to unfold--not in detail anyway. How could this generation 
  know for sure that it couldn't change the system unless it tried? (Despite the 
  teachings of Christ to the otherwise). Bill Clinton staged a Sixties-style-sortee 
  into the belly of the Beast and, well, we shall see. If he is not assassinated 
  by the time he leaves office then he has, in more ways than he can imagine, 
  been let off the hook. A very fitting and historical sequel to his famous &quot;Handshake 
  with Kennedy in the White House garden&quot; could have been his own murder, 
  played out again before the eyes of the whole world, at the hands of another 
  group of American patriots. (Clinton was let off the hook):</font></p>

  <p><b>Frankly, I never shared the national nostalgia for the 1950s. And its 
    not merely due to a lingering vendetta against poodle skirts and angora sweaters. 
    When others wax over the heyday of the nuclear family, I wane over the height 
    of the Cold War. They conjure up a picket-fence suburbia, I picture a segregated 
    South...For all these reasons, I was astonished when I first discovered that 
    the sitcoms of my childhood were on some endless TV loop. Fathers who know 
    best, Ozzie and Harriet, Brady bunches all rerun continually before another 
    generation of American children. They watch wistfully or ironically--as if 
    that's the way (our) life was and (their) life should be.</b></p>
  <p><b>Adults also rerun that postwar era. In the ongoing culture wars, Americans 
    are still arguing about whether the 1950s were Paradise and the 1960s the 
    Fall. There are many who believe that during the Sixties some alien force 
    took a moral wrecking ball to the whole country. This year, half of the debates 
    over the president's &quot;character&quot; were deadlocked replays of arguments 
    about whether or not the president is the final icon of the out-of-control

    answers, 'I don't know, I think it's harder. You can't stop something that 
    is inside you right now.'&quot;... Somewhere between the first and second

    neither too virtuous, nor too wicked. If he is squeaky clean, then we can't 
    recognize ourselves in him. And if we can't identify with his fall, then it 
    won't evoke in us the special, interested fear of tragedy: There, but for

  <p><b>At the same time, if he is all bad, then his fall will not arouse pity.

  <p><b>Wicked, Clinton is not. But he is no angel either. Unlike Al Gore or Jimmy

    the curve.</b></p>
  <p><b>Above all, the tragic character must be implicated in his own demise.

    knowledgably discuss the doctrines of original sin and justification by faith. 
    He attends church, speaks warmly of his long friendship with Billy Graham, 
    and points to the Graham crusade in Little Rock as a life-changing event for

<blockquote>
  <p><b> ...Does God really judge the United States or any other country as a 
    <i>national entity</i>?<i> </i>I have often heard this verse quoted as a formular 
    for national revival: <i>If my people which are called by My Name, will humble 
    themselves and pray and seek My Face and turn from their wicked ways, then 
    will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.</i> 
    (2 Chron.7:14). Yet that promise was given as part of God's covenantal relationship 
    with the ancient Hebrews; its occasion was the dedication of Solomon's temple, 
    God's dwelling place. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Understand 
    2 Corinthians 6:14-16)</font><b>. Have we any reason to assume that God has 
    a similar covenant with the U.S.A.? </b></p>
  <p><b>Certainly the Old Testament shows God's dealing with national entities: 
    the prophets called down judgments on Israel and Judah, as well as Philistia 
    and Babylon. But the New Testament seems to introduce a major shift. Jesus 
    stressed &quot;the kingdom of heaven&quot; as the central focus of God's activity, 
    a kingdom that transcends national boundaries and permeates society so as 
    to affect the whole gradually, like salt sprinkled on meat. </b></p>
  <p><b>Pentecost got the new kingdom off to a rousing international start, an 
    Ethiopian eunuch soon spread it to Africa, and before long a man named Paul 
    declared himself &quot;apostle to the Gentiles.&quot; Paul cared deeply about 
    individual churches...but I find no indication that he gave any thought to 
    a &quot;Christianized&quot; Roman Empire. The Revelation of John continues 
    the pattern: that book records specific messages to Seven churches but dismisses 
    the political entity of what many conclude was Rome as &quot;Babylon the great, 
    the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth. (Rev.17:5). (See 
    Acts 13:39-41, Habakkuk, chapter 1 and Revelation 18).</b></p>
  <p><b>Some historians argue that the church loses sight of its mission as it 
    moves closer to the seat of power. Witness the era of Constantine or Europe 
    just before the Reformation. We may be seeing history repeat itself...</b></p>
  <p><b>At various points in U.S. history, (most recently the Moral Majority Movement 
    of 1980s), the Christian church has marked an ascendancy into politics. Now, 
    it appears (under Clinton), the church and politics may be heading in different 
    directions. I, for one, feel no great sense of alarm over the fact. Our real 
    challenge, the focus of our energy, should not be to Christianize the United 
    States (always a losing battle) but rather to strive to be Christ's church 
    in an increasingly hostile world. As Karl Barth said, &quot;The church exists...to 
    set up in the world a new sign which is radically dissimilar to (the world's) 
    own manner and which contradicts it in a way which is full of promise...</b></p>
  <p><b>There is much to be said for the social atmosphere of the 1950s (when 
    white, christian, capitalist men were fully in charge of the American police 
    state, and all things were ordered well). But if that environment does not 
    return, I won't lose any sleep. AS AMERICA SLIDES, I WILL WORK AND PRAY FOR 
    THE KINGDOM OF GOD. IF THE GATES OF HELL CANNOT PREVAIL AGAINST THE CHURCH, 
    THE CURRENT POLITICAL SCENE HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF IMPEDING ITS ADVANCE. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Christianity

<p align="center"><b>THE CANDIDATE</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>By John W. Whitehead</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>I knew Bill Clinton before the world knew Bill Clinton. It was early 1974, 
    and we were both at the University of Arkansas School of Law: he was a young 
    associate law professor and I was a third-year law student with Marxist views. 
    Although I never took a class with him, I did meet him on several occasions 
    to interview him for an article I wrote for the <i>Grapevine</i>, a local 
    underground newspaper...</b></p>
  <p><b>We met several times over a few weeks and discussed his views...This was 
    his first political interview, and we covered a wide range of subjects--his 
    work on George McGovern's Presidential campaign, the role government should 
    play in our lives, and Bob Dylan's music. &quot;I think he's a genius,&quot; 
    Mr. Clinton told me. </b></p>
  <p><b>I shared that view, subscribing to Mr. Dylan's lyric, &quot;Propaganda, 
    all is phoney.&quot; Politicians to me, were the epitome of phoniness, and 
    there was no way to trust them. But Mr. Clinton had an uncanny ability to 
    look you in the eye and make you feel like the greatest person on earth. Thus 
    I went into those interviews very critical of him, but wound up praising him 
    in the introduction to my article: &quot;To those of us who knew the empty 
    feeling that accompanied the McGovern defeat, Bill Clinton could probably 
    be the reinstatement of the people's candidate.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>When asked about the failure of the McGovern campaign, he said, &quot;We 
    went at politics as if it were some kind of religion, and everyone was either 
    standing with us in the light or standing against us in the darkness.&quot; 
    <i>The Candidate</i>, a movie starring Robert Redford, was getting a lot of 
    attention at the time. It was about a young, idealistic lawyer who started 
    off as an honest candidate for public office and by the film's end had become 
    corrupt and phoney. &quot;What about this happening to you?&quot; I asked 
    Mr. Clinton. &quot;Now you could say that you were in a pure state. What's 
    going to happen to you later?&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>He responded: &quot;What happened to the Candidate was he became a product 
    of a modern mass industrial society, a sort of packaged product. He was nothing 
    more to the people than a P.R. man's construction. He didn't say anything 
    about anything. I WONT LET THIS HAPPEN TO ME.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>Our paths didn't cross again until years later. I went on to practice 
    law, start a family, become a Christian, change some of my political views 
    and establish an organization that specializes in civil liberties and religious 
    rights. Not until the Rutherford Institute got involved in the Paula Corbin 
    Jones case against Mr. Clinton did we meet again--but this time on different 
    terms.</b></p>
  <p><b>TO ME THE REAL QUESTIONS TODAY ARE: HOW DID BILL CLINTON BECOME WHAT HE 
    SAID HE WOULDN'T BECOME? How could someone with so much promise self-annihilate 
    the way he has?</b></p>

<p> <font size="+1">While Clinton will prove not to be &quot;the&quot; Antichrist 
  (the one for whom this title is still chiefly reserved), or even any longer 
  &quot;an&quot; antichrist, as those who shall follow him into office, he has, 
  nevertheless, taken a turn in <i>The Seat of the Scornful</i>--and has in effect 
  taken it on behalf of an entire (Sixties) generation. And this, so that everyone 
  could see at last what a vain and fruitless exercise it was. All changes taking 
  place inside of the present political and economic order only serve to make 
  that order more deceptive, but still at the core as diabolical and wicked as 
  ever. While Clinton is not a facsist at heart, in all of its potential and unfolding 
  sense of the term, he ran with the fascists and grew personally comfortable 
  in their presence. He forgot his mission (the one that the 60s generation entrusted 
  him with...but in forgetting he fulfilled it). Not a militarist at heart, but 
  in the arms of <i>the Harlot</i>, and one with with <i>the Beast</i>, he became 
  convinced that he could use the Armed Forces at his disposal (the most technologically 
  powerful military force the world has ever known), for the good of the world. 
  How could he, in his own blind ambition, see that if God had chosen to let the 
  full weight of judgment come against America on his watch, he, instead of his 
  successor, would have been the one that would have had to wage war, not only 
  in the areas of the world that he did but everywhere else that God has chosen, 
  and against the very powers of Heaven themselves.</font></p>

    seemingly every historical-rhetorical card: World War I, World War II, the 
    Cold War, Vietnam--even the struggle against hate crimes and discrimination 
    against gays and lesbians. But Clinton's orgy of analogy only proves, as Alexander 
    Pope wrote nearly three centuries ago, &quot;a little learning is a dangerous 
    thing&quot;--and so drink deep, the poet advised, or drink not at all from 
    the spring of wisdom.</b></p>
  <p><b>Clinton's arguments show that he has learned the contradictory lessons 
    of the last century of statecraft and that he agrees with all of them. The 
    most poignant of these historical references is World War I, which was triggered 
    by an assassination in the Balkan city of Sarajevo, just 100 miles from Kosovo.</b></p>
  <p><b>ONE BY ONE IN THE SUMMER OF 1914, THE GREAT POWERS OF EUROPE WERE PPULLED 
    BY THEIR ALLIANCES INTO THECAULDRON OF CONFLICT...</b></p>
  <p><b>Serbia is no strategic threat to America. But that doesn't mean that Milosovic

    World War I and, since enemies tend to have long memories, an act of vengeance 
    <i>(For vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord...</i>Deut.32:35-42; Heb.10:30,31) 
    could come in a year, a decade, or a century.</b></p>
  <p><b>Americans have gotten used to push-button conflicts in which we suffer 
    virtually no casualties. But our power, however well-intentioned and well-aimed, 
    feels far different to those who have been on the receiving end of a cruise 
    missile or who think they may be next. IF CLINTON UNDERSTOOD HISTORY AS WELL

    months since, Bill Clinton watched and dithered, threatened and flinched, 
    while Saddam set about reconstituting his weapons of mass destruction. Then 
    after 400 days of inaction, hours before the House of Representatives was 
    to impeach him, Clinton decided this was the day to take America to war...</b></p>
  <p><b>What pushed him over the edge...? A <i>report. </i>Clinton said that after 
    reviewing UN chief inspector Butler's report on Iraqi noncompliance, he had 
    to act.</b></p>
  <p><b>But there was nothing in the report that he didn't already know. Among 
    the report's documented violations, Clinton told the nation, was that, &quot;prior 
    to the inspection of (one) site, Iraq actually emptied out the building.&quot; 
    Shocked--<i>shocked</i>--to find cheating going on, Clinton took America to 
    war.</b></p>
  <p><b><i>Immediately</i>. Impeachment eve. Couldn't wait another minute, said

  <p><b>Still skeptical of my motives? asks Clinton. Well, if you don't believe 
    me, believe my advisers. I did this, he said, &quot;on the unanimous recommendation 
    of my national security team.&quot; he then proceeded, pathetically, to enumerate 
    every single one of them...</b></p>
  <p><b>It was reminiscent of Clinton's other Iraq speech at the Pentagon in February, 
    where he was oddly and lavishly introduced by one underling after another...as

  <p><b>Mr. Clinton, in a didactic 13-minute address, said the NATO attacks on 
    Serb targets were intended to avert a humanitarian disaster and to serve American 
    geopolitical interests. He conjured images of Balkan concentration camps and 
    &quot;genocide in the heart of Europe&quot; that offend American moral sensibilities 
    and threaten American values and interests. &quot;If we and our allies were 
    to allow this war to continue with no response, President Milosevic would

  <p><b>Dylan is proud of his new album, <i>Time Out of Mind</i>, and rightfully 
    so. The album...is far and away his best sustained work since the mid-1970s; 
    it reaches the exalted level of <i>Blood on the Tracks</i>. His new songs--his 
    first set of them since 1990--are embittered, heartsick and weary: <i>When 
    you think that you've lost everything, you find out you can always lose a 
    little more</i>, he sings in a rasping voice whose familiar cracks have become 
    potholes. It's the voice of a 56-year-old man who's not hiding any of his 
    bruises. Yet the character who runs through all the songs on the album seems 
    nothing like the relaxed, buoyant songwriter who's talking about them. Asked 
    who the woman was who broke his heart in song after song, he laughs and asks, 
    &quot;Which one? Which song?&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b><i>Time Out of Mind</i> (Columbia) is bleak and riveting. Its 11 songs 
    are about the lonliness, anger and desolation of lost love, and about looming 
    mortality. (The album was recorded before Dylan was hospitalized over the 
    summer with a life-threatening heart infection). <i>I've been walking through 
    the middle of nowhere, trying to get to heaven before they close the door</i>, 
    Dylan sings. He has rarely sounded optimistic; spite and self-righteous contempt 
    animate many of his best songs. But <i>Time Out of Mind</i> provides fewer 
    comforts than ever.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Environment affects me a great deal,&quot; Dylan says. &quot;A lot 
    of songs were written after the sun went down. And I like storms, I like to 
    stay up during a storm. I get very meditative sometimes, and this one phrase 
    was going through my head: <i>Work while the day lasts, because the night 
    of death cometh when no man can work</i>. I don't recall where I heard it. 
    I like preaching, I hear a lot of preaching, and I probably just heard it 
    somewhere. Maybe it's in the Psalms, it beats me. But it wouldn't let me go. 
    I was, like, what does that phrase mean? But it was at the forefront of my 
    mind, for a long period of time, and I think alot of that is instilled into 
    this record.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>The blues has always been a Dylan touchstone, for both words and music. 
    In many ways his groundbreaking 1960s songs were transmuted blues, from the 
    surreal juxtaposition of the lyrics to the rough-hewn vocals to the blues 
    bands he hired when he plugged in. Throughout <i>Time Out of Mind </i>Dylan 
    quotes hoary blues lines like <i>Going down the road feeling bad. </i>And 
    in his maturity, he is closer than ever to the clear-eyed fatalism of classic 
    blues. In song after song, the singer walks down dark, empty roads, muttering 
    accusations at a woman who left him; he's still wishing she would come back 
    and wondering, in one song, whether he would kiss her or kill her if she did...</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;There's a lot of clever people around who write songs,&quot; Dylan 
    says. &quot;My songs, what makes them different is that there's a foundation 
    to them. That's why they're still around, that's why my songs are still being 
    performed. It's not because they're such great songs. They don't fall into 
    the commercial catagory. They're not written to be performed by other people. 
    But they're standing on a strong foundation, and subliminally that's what 
    people are hearing.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;Those old songs are my lexicon and my prayer book,&quot; he adds. 
    &quot;All my beliefs come out of those old songs, literally, anything from 
    <i>Let Me Rest on That Peaceful Mountain</i> to <i>Keep on the Sunny Side. 
    </i>You can find all my philosophy in those old songs. I believe in a God 
    of time and space, but if people ask me about that, my impulse is to point 
    them back toward those songs. I believe in Hank Williams singing <i>I Saw 
    the Light</i>. I've seen the light, too.&quot; Dylan says he now subscribes 
    to no organized religion...In <i>Time Out of Mind</i> Dylan refuses listeners 
    (much) solace; he often sounds like he would welcome death. <i>It's not dark 
    yet, but it's getting there</i>, he sings, unguarded and matter of fact.</b></p>

  <p><b>We talked about some mutual friends we'd lost. He later tried to bring 
    it all back home with the Rolling Thunder Review in 1975-76. &quot;Those were 
    wonderful days, all right,&quot; Dylan said. &quot;It was a movement then, 
    a real movement. But it was probably the last movement. Say, &quot; he exclaimed, 
    laughing, &quot;that would make a good song title, wouldn't it?&quot; Dylan 
    resumed, sadly: &quot;The dream is gone. It is meaningless to try to grasp 
    what passed. I see no similarity between today and what happened in the early 
    1960s. Those early days in the Village were great...Now things are depressing...&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Could he find any encouragement in the New Left? &quot;The New Left has 
    no policy, no program, no philosophy. There really isn't a New Left. Those 
    people who march for peace are just interested in peace, but that doesn't 
    make them part of any New Left...&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>The words were cynical, but his tone wasn't. I asked him what he'd been 
    reading lately. It was the sort of question he'd never answer when he arrived 
    in New York, when he was devouring everything he could lay his eyes on. Even 
    in the late 1960s, when he kept a large open Bible on a reaching stand in 
    Woodstock, he...thought it pretentious to tell anyone. In early 1977, the 
    London Times asked Dylan, among many literary heavies, which books he regarded 
    as the most underrated and overrated of the century. Dylan puckishly gave 
    the same answer to both questions: &quot;The Bible.&quot;...</b></p>
  <p><b>We agreed that America was in trouble again, that the masters of war were 
    still in power. Dylan did not say how, or if, he might remount the barricades. 
    Yet, when he said to me, &quot;They're not going to get away with it,&quot; 
    there was a steely resolve in his voice. I didn't need to ask who &quot;they&quot; 
    were... </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No Direction Home, The

  <p><b>&quot;Gil took out his six-string Gibson, handed it over to Bob Dylan, 
    saying how Bob's new song, <i>Masters of War</i> was one of the best Bob had 
    ever written. I kept on thinking he had written...some that had real lyric 
    poetry, like <i>Blowin in the Wind</i>, and <i>Hard Rain's Gonna Fall</i> 
    which makes you think right away of (Fedirico Garcia) Lorca, and I waited 
    for the images of rain, and thunder, and lightning to come out in great spectacles. 
    But no, this time there was a different kind of poetry, one of great anger, 
    accusation, just saying who the masters of war are, without comprimising one 
    inch in its short sharp direct intensity...I was willing to bet Columbia Records 
    would never record Dylan's <i>Masters of War</i> and <i>With God on Our Side</i>...(but 
    soon) social-comment music began to reach a wider audience. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">p.140</font><b>.</b></p>

  <p><i><b>THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN</b></i><b>: A summation of the sixties 
    mood. No cautious questioning now, but a prophetic voice trumpeting a changing 
    order. The song was widely recorded and translated into Serbian, French, Hebrew, 
    and other languages. The imagery is primal, homespun&quot; a flood tide, fate's 
    spinning wheel, a blocked doorway, the storm of battle, a changing road. While 
    this could be played over film-clips of Prague, Paris, Chicago, and Berkeley, 
    it is also a timeless dialogue between those restrained old ways and those 
    daring something new.</b></p>
  <p><b>At first the lyrics' biblical roll seems to reflect black gospel song. 
    The title line suggests the warning in Revelation 1:3 ...<i>for the time is 
    near</i>. There is an echo from Mark 10:31: <i>But many that are first will 
    be last, and the last first </i> in Dylan's lines: <i>For the loser now/ Will 
    be later to win...</i>and <i>And the first one now/ Will later be last.</i></b></p>
  <p><b><i>WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE</i>: One of Dylan's most cutting myth-breakers. 
    It preceded widespread challenges to education, curriculum, and textbooks. 
    The title line appears in Robert Southey (<i>The laws are with us and God's 
    on our side</i>) and in Shaw's <i>Saint Joan</i>. Ironically, this song led 
    one fan's mother to relent: &quot;At least he believes in God.&quot;...It 
    is very pointedly cast in a folk matrix, with the <i>naive, </i>humble lad 
    describing his background and schooling, which entrenched the myth of God's 
    approval for ungodly wars. After shifting God's approbation from our side 
    to even Judas Iscariot's side, the final verse hammers home the narrator's 
    new morality: <i>If God's on our side/ He'll stop the next war...God on Our 
    Side</i> can be contrasted startingly with his later, evangelical songs on 
    <i>Slow Train Coming</i>.</b></p>
  <p><b><i>WHEN THE SHIP COMES IN</i>: One of Dylan's prophecies, optimistic and 
    vengeful in heralding the day when evil will be purged. The allusions have 
    the powerful roll of gospel, evoking both Old Testament figures, like Pharaoh 
    and Goliath, and the spirit of St. John the Divine. The ship is a universal 
    salvation symbol. Gabrielle Goodchild: &quot;Throughout myth and literature, 
    we find water as a symbol of the unconscious, spirituality, and death, and 
    the ship as the tiny ego of man making its lonely or triumphant voyage across 
    dangerous deeps.&quot; Carolyn Bliss in her master's thesis closely parallels 
    Revelation 7:1, where <i>no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any 
    tree</i> to Dylan's opening: <i>Oh the time will come up/ When the winds will 
    stop/ And the breeze will cease to be breathin. </i>The line <i>the whole 
    wide world is watching </i>was chanted by protesters during the 1968 Democratic 
    National Convention in Chicago. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">pp.212-214</font><b>.</b></p>
