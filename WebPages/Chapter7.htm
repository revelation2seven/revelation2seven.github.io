<p align="center"><b>(The proto-Hebrew Phoenician alphabet, the source of the 
  Greek alphabet)</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Accepted scholarship has the Phoenician alphabet finding its 
  way out of the East (a letter here, a mark there), across the islands of the 
  Mediterranean to the mainland of Greece, in and around the 9th and 10th centuries 
  B.C. The evidence, however, placing the Phoenicians out on the Atlantic, as 
  far back as the Atlantean period (from the time of Adam to Noah), immediately 
  suggests that this form of writing is a product of Atlantean civilization, and 
  that it arrived in the East centuries later, along with those merchants who 
  eventually entered the Mediterranean, naming such trading ports after themselves 
  as Tyre, Sidon, and Carthage. (Please read <i>Sailing to Paradise, The Discovery 
  of the Americas by 7,000 BC, </i>by Jim Baily, and see Ezekiel, chapters 26 
  to 28):</font></p>

    its base in the Atlantic ocean to attack the cities of Europe and Asia. For 
    in those days the Atlantic was navigable. There was an island (a continent), 
    opposite the strait which you call (so you say) the Pillars of Hercules, an 
    island larger than Libya and Asia combined; from it travelers in those days 
    could reach the other islands, and from them the whole opposite continent 
    which surrounds what can truly be called the ocean. For the sea within the 
    strait we are talking about is like a lake with a narrow entrance; the outer 
    ocean is the real ocean and the land which entirely surrounds it is properly 
    termed continent. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On this island of Atlantis had 
    risen a powerful and remarkable dynasty of kings, who ruled the whole island, 
    and many other islands as well and parts of the continent; in addition it 
    controlled within the strait, Libya (Africa) up to the borders of Egypt and 
    Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This dynasty, gathering its whole power together, 
    attempted to enslave at a single stroke, your country and ours and all the 
    territory within the strait… At a later time there was earthquakes and &quot;floods&quot; 
    of extraordinary violence, and in a single dreadful day and night all your 
    fighting men were swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis was 
    similarly swallowed up by the sea and vanished; this is why the sea in that 
    area is to this day impassable to navigation, which is hindered by mud just 
    below the surface, the remains of a sunken island.&quot; </font>(see Job 41:30;

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The point is that they were there, and that others wrote about 
  it. And from this we reason that this ancient Hebrew, proto-Greek, Phoenician 
  script was not only being employed by the Druid-Hebrew scribes of Central Europe 
  in the time of D.V.D. and Solomon, but that it arrived there in its earliest 
  form centuries before when the children of Israel came back up into Europe in 
  the time of Jehoshua (YHWShWA...<img src="../UsedImages/yhwshwa.gif" width="89" height="14">). 
  We find them in history, and all throughout ancient Europe bearing the eponymous 
  name of DaN--the FIFTH son of Jacob. (Genesis 29:30-Gen.30:6). This because 
  as they came up into this land they did so under the shadow and the direction 
  of the Angel of Divine Presence, whose own Strong Right Arm is revealed at the 
  FIFTH place on the World Tree named DiN, <a href="../UsedImages/pg547.gif">or 
  Power</a>. </font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg152.gif" width="480" height="169"></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Dalet ( <img src="../UsedImages/dandalet.gif" width="9" height="16"> 
  ) in the name DaN--representing one of the Doorways leading into the Mystery 
  from all Four directions--North, South, East, and West ( <img src="../UsedImages/SquareDalets.gif" width="14" height="14"> 
  )--is also equivalent to the number Four that seems to be missing in the upper 
  court on the Oracle. This empty space, which in the traditions of the Kabbalah 
  is named <i>Daat</i>, or &quot;Knowledge,&quot; represents in this case the 
  mysteries of Europe that were hidden from the world in Old Testament times, 
  but fulfilled and revealed later in the mystery of Christ: The letter N, or 
  Nun, in the name DaN, which is numerically equivalent to the number 50, also 
  represents and looks forward to the events of the great Jubilee, which all of 
  Israel <i>MUST</i> observe if it is to appear before God alive, and fully delivered, 
  on the morning of the coming age. (Leviticus 25:1-10; Colossians 2:16,17).. 
  It also answers the question: <i>And why did DaN remain in ships.</i>(Judges 
  5:17).</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">These earliest of Hebrew letters provided the form for the 
  sacred and (very peculiar) writings of the Hebrew-Druid-Jewish school of thought, 
  the same that the children of Israel also brought back with them when they returned 
  to &quot;MIDian&quot; (Central Europe) after the time of Moses (Exodus 2:15 
  to 3:12). These oracles governed the religious thinking of almost the whole 
  of Europe (and beyond), up to the time of those mythical and archetypal figures 
  of D.V.D. and Solomon. (See 2 Chronicles, chapters 1, and 2)...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">But because these universal teachings were also being conscripted 
  by the world at large, and used by the sons of Darkness in particular, to establish 
  city-states and empires of their own (indeed, from the time of the first Egyptian 
  dynasties right up to our own time), (which was, of course, the intent of the 
  Spirit to begin with, so that the Darkness could come at last to its own fruition), 
  the Hebrew writings themselves were being re-crafted. Through a whole process 
  of kabbalistic manipulations the old Indo-European (primarily proto-Gaelic) 
  tongue was being transformed into the priestly Hebrew dialect of the Torah...which 
  had the effect of hiding the central meanings of the Hebrew Mystery from the 
  rest of the world. (The hidden priestly writings, however, after finding their 
  way into the spoken dialects of other peoples and nations--most noted among 
  them the Aramaic culture of the Middle East--gave rise to the forced, yet spoken 
  Hebrew language of today. But in the beginning there was no Hebrew language 
  other than Gaelic)...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Phoenicians, long fallen from the ancient relationship 
  they enjoyed with the Hebrew adepts, whose forbears traveled across the sea 
  together to Eden and back, used their developing language skills to facilitate 
  commerce, introducing its written forms into the spoken dialects of those it 
  did business with. While at the same time the Hebrew scribes were employing 
  their skills, and these same Phoenician characters, in both their hieroglyphic 
  and numerical forms, to compose the scriptures. The 22 characters of the Hebrew-Phoenician 
  alphabet, corresponding to the 22 lines of influence that connect each of the 
  Ten sefiroth on the Tree of Life to each other, reveal in part how the spoken 
  and written word was being transmitted and received from culture to culture, 
  and the pathways it took from one end of the earth to the other--from those 
  ancient times to our own.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">The East</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg279.gif" width="155" height="243"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="+1">The West</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the other far-reaching effect is that as the words and 
  letters joined themselves to the various written traditions of those times, 
  they had a governing influence on the process of literary transformation. As 
  the old dialects died, and as emerging languages such as the Greek, and now 
  modern English, overshadowed them, many of the meanings that were sewn into 
  the old would reappear in the new, and as such were passed along to subsequent 
  generations. An example is the shape and the numerical equivalence of the letter 
  <i>ayin</i> in the Old-Hebrew script. It is in shape, a Circle, and in numerical 
  value, 70. Thus where the phrase <i>Seventy years</i> is used at Jeremiah 25:11, 
  we are in this case to visualize a Circle, one that is completing itself here 
  at the end of the age. And where it says: <i>And all the souls that came out 
  of the loins of Jacob were SEVENTY </i><i> souls...</i>(Exodus 1:5; Deuteronomy 
  32:8)<i>, </i> we are to visualize the full number of every individual who has 
  ever entered into the great Circle of this mystery, from one end of the earth 
  to the other. Or the letter <i>zayin</i>. In the Old-Hebrew, as in the Greek, 
  it is equivalent to the number 7. Seven is the place on the Oracle where all 
  of the events of this age are coming to their conclusion. Thus by the time the 
  letter Z finds its way into English usage it is fittingly, at the end. </font></p>

<p align="center"><b>From Proto-Hebrew to Greek (the Septuagint)and Latin to English</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Having, over a period of twenty years and more, mastered not 
  only the meanings of the holy letters and words, as well as the spoken dialects 
  of those to whom they were sent (please see 2 Kings 22:14), these ancient adepts 
  went abroad. Coming among the different peoples, perhaps carrying a Cadeuces, 
  an image of the Serpent on the Tree (Numbers 21:6-9), indicating that they were 
  healers and that they had come in peace, they were allowed to take up residence 
  and to teach...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(We have seen in history, however, clearly from the time of 
  Christ to our own, how these things degenerate, how they devolve back into the 
  same state of tribalism [and eventually nationalism] that these Hebrew priests 
  came to address in the first place. It happens when these priestly orders forget 
  their focus and their mission, and when they grow comfortable and become re-entangled 
  over time in the secular causes, the petty intrigues, and the politics and then 
  the wars of the people around them; and when they become--for whatever social 
  or personal reasons--a sometimes-unwitting, and sometimes-blatant, part of the 
  established order [or mis-order] themselves. More endeared to their high positions 
  among the people, than they were to the task they arrived with--the task of 
  revealing spiritual reality to the natural mind--these priests soon lost sight 
  of the Divine Presence that hovered over them, and passed this loss directly 
  onto those they ordained in their places. [Understand Hebrews 5:1-4]. And these 
  became, instead, as almost the entire organized church is today, a cult of worldlings--worldly 
  priests, and worldly teachers--in a word, the priests and the prophets of Ba'al...1 
  Kings, chapter 18).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Appearing among the people, with many of the precepts, commandments, 
  and epic verses learned at the sacred college committed to memory, they also 
  carried with them portions of their cryptic texts. As they read from them, however, 
  they spoke in the dialect of the people. The written Levitical expressions themselves 
  had no exact spoken form. They were used to both preserve and transmit spiritual 
  concepts in the form of allegorical stories and metaphors. If there was such 
  a thing as a spoken Hebrew language in those times it was, as we said before, 
  the <a href="SideLinks/StraightPath.htm">ancient language of Europe</a> (see 
  2 Kings 18:26), which after centuries of attrition and assimilation settled 
  down in the several Gaelic or Celtic dialects which were spoken in the time 
  of the prophets...and which were later driven into near obscurity before the 
  Romans (and need we mention the Roman church that supported them from the times 
  of Constantine and Charlegmane onwards). </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It has long been the general 
    opinion of the learned, that there was a universal elementary language of 
    Europe, which for geographical reasons of the extent of territory anciently

    which the more primitive it was, must be the stronger of the energy of nature,

  and without. But it was never waged in the literal, mortal-combat sense against 
  other individuals. (2 Corinthians 10:1-6). Their weapons were always the parables, 
  the natural metaphors, and the psycho-historical allusions which the Spirit 
  provided, thus the deeper, unwritten implications of the Law itself, which turn 
  everyone who discovers them into true spiritual warriors. (Romans 8:4-8; Ephesians 
  6:10-17). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The ancient Phoenicians meanwhile, taking advantage of the 
  judgments that were falling down upon those who were originally charged with 
  keeping the Covenant--and this because the children of Israel would no longer 
  hew to the underlying meanings of the Law, or listen to the prophets, and of 
  the fact that Israel was destined to be scattered more than once from the center 
  of its own spiritual state of Mind--must have come to believe that they themselves 
  were the &quot;keepers&quot; of the Oracles of God. (Woe to the &quot;keepers,&quot; 
  or worse yet, the &quot;usurpers&quot; of the Oracles of God). The cult-center 
  on the island of Crete, near Mt. Ida (or IuDeA) was an attempt to create in 
  the literal sea an image of those things that were being hidden in the middle 
  of the figurative Sea (where the Great Dragon &quot;literally&quot; lay hidden 
  from the eyes of the world) in the center of Europe. (Isaiah 27 to 29, KJV). 
  This, of course, prompted Paul centuries later to refer to the inhabitants of 
  Crete as &quot;slowbellies,&quot; an allusion to the <i>serpent</i> who must 
  crawl upon its own <i>geological</i> belly all the days of its natural life.</font></p>

  that foreboding place. And while God obscured the central meanings from all 
  who were not initiated into the school of the prophets, the world knew just 
  enough about them to fall into the apostacies of the classical ages of Greece 
  and Rome, and to re-create them in what was called the &quot;re-enlightenment&quot; 
  of the modern era. The dimensions of the oracles, and the hidden mysteries, 
  were, after all, both epic and historical. They contained the notion of a City 
  on an </font><font size="+1">epic journey (away from the center of that place), 
  whose citizens would be wise philosophers, and more virtuous than the inhabitants 
  of any other city on earth, and whose own favorite &quot;son&quot; would be

  And weren't they the masters of (their) world, each in their own time? And didn't 
  they possess the Power? And why shouldn't America imagine itself to be this 
  holy Nation? This Shining City on a Hill? After all, isn't America and the Universal 
  Israel the same nation? Don't they share the same destiny? The prophets of Ba'al 
  say so. And why shouldn't the European States be suffering from similar delusions

  Twentieth centuries of our own times. Read them in light of the oracles. Open 
  the Book of Isaiah, and hear the prophets inveighing against Israel's participation 
  in the founding of the Greek city-states in the Seventh and Eighth centuries 
  B.C., and in the affairs of Grecian culture in general. But also hear them crying 
  out against Israel's participation in the founding of the American city-states 
  in the Eighteenth century of our own times. Open the Book of Jeremiah and see 
  the children of Iuda being led out of Central and Eastern Europe by the Scythian 
  warlords of the Sixth century B.C. Open the Book of Jeremiah again, on the morning 
  of the 20th century. See the Jews being led away to Babylon again, this time

<p><font size="+1">Of the whole historical drama, in which the cosmic principles 
  of Symmetry are established, Isaiah says: <i>The book is delivered to one that 
  is learned...and he says, I cannot read it, for it is sealed. </i>(Isaiah 29:11). 
  Thus it was sealed from those who fell away in those times, not only into the 
  secular culture of the Greeks, but past it, beyond the Hellespont, toward that 
  city in the Middle East that Moses built centuries before--as an image in stone-below 
  of that Great City which would be built in time <i>above</i>. (See Galatians 
  4:21-31). The whole of Israel must have understood the relationship between 
  these two cities, the literal and the spiritual, in the time of Moses, but those 
  who followed after them soon forgot. (Ezekiel 23). Which is why the Samaritans, 
  whose historic task it was to guard the Eastern gates of this mystery, so that 
  no one would come back down and confuse the one city for the other, did not 
  feel indicted by the words of the prophets. It was not them, they said, who 
  were in the transgression, but rather those who pushed their way passed them, 
  back out of Europe...to &quot;Jerusalem.&quot; But didn't the oracles say that 
  Israel would rise up out of this Eastern land again, just as it did in the time 
  of YHWShWA? Those who lived there in that time just didn't recognize it as it 
  was happening, when that Druid-like Hebrew prophet John the Baptist appeared 
  among the Essenes to lead the mind of the people back up into the center of 
  their own mysteries. The Samaritan woman recognized it. (John 4:1-26). It was 
  to be a time of Mercy and Love, not armed uprising and rebellion. Those times 
  were in every way, a figure and a mirror-image of our own times--the time of 
  Christ.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The sins of Jeroboam, the son of Solomon, who is figuratively 
  responsible for turning the mind of Israel away from the center of its own mysteries 
  (1 Kings 12:26-31), resulted in another form of heresy which spread westward 
  and northward as well, of which the world will hear little of until just before 
  the time of Christ--the priest-cult, as we have already mentioned, of the Druids. 
  We still have the view of them that Juilius Caesar drew in our minds on his 
  return from Gaul. Samuel, Nathan and the prophets of Israel, were Druids also, 
  prototypes of the later Merlins. Unlike others, however, they never abandoned 
  the mysteries if <i>Iuda</i>. According to the proverb, &quot;To every cow her 
  calf, so to every book its copy,&quot; Jeroboam forged &quot;Two Golden Calves.&quot; 
  This means that he began to interpret these Solar mysteries according to his 
  own lights, and in so doing perverted the mind of Israel (with a form of the 
  truth however) from one side of the Oracle to the other:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And he said, I suppose my 
    countrymen that ye know this, THAT EVERY PLACE HATH GOD IN IT, nor is there 
    one determinate place in which He is. But He everywhere hears and sees those

    long a journey to Jerusalem which is an enemies city to worship him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was man who built the temple. 
    I have also two Golden (Solar) Heifers dedicated to the same God, that those 
    of you who live nearest to them may go and worship...I will ordain certain

    Kings 12:3-33).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The key phrase is, <i>A ram</i> <i>WHICH THEY SAY</i> <i>Aaron 
  the priest brought also</i>. Unable to interpret the sacred allegories, or the 
  meanings of the natural metaphors and symbols employed in the Torah, an ability, 
  which Paul said, eludes the natural man (see 1 Corinthians 1:18 to 2:16), these 
  priests of the &quot;natural sort&quot; could do no better over the course of 
  the ensuing centuries than to lead their congregations deeper into error and 
  idolatry. As the Saducees in Palestine, they could do no better than to set 
  up ritual and sacrificial images, and to embrace ideas of what they imagined 
  to be the truth, but could never penetrate to the truth itself...</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">These were the Druids that we meet in the time of Caesar. God's 
  same Presence overshadowed them but they could no longer gain a clear view of 
  it. Without a direct connection to the Divine Spirit they could not attain to 
  the right mix of mental perceptions necessary to open the Eye of spiritual intuition. 
  The mystery remained for them, as it does for every priestly order aligned to 
  tribal powers, as a--to use a current example--a Rubik's cube unsolved. They 
  would always see one changing face of God or another, but would never be able 
  to comprehend the whole. Such shortsightedness in the face of the unfolding 
  decrees of Nature leads to a state of spiritual, social and political bewilderment 
  and uncertainty. And in a time of judgment it leads to a show of great swelling 
  words and idle threats, against who else, but God?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> The rise of terrorism in the world today, and the increasing 
  incidences of violence in the American workplace and schools comes immediately 
  to mind. But why are the people confused about it? Guns, weaponry and explosives 
  are a maddening American pastime. The American nation itself is founded in such 
  violence and terrorism, and in its own wicked state-sponsered intrusion into 
  the lives and workplaces of other peoples. (Please see the chapter entitled 
  &quot;Beware the Hunter&quot;). God hasn't forgotten these things. Thus the 
  nation is only now beginning to reap what it has sown. It is the Law of Nature. 
  It is a Day of Judgment. And therefore the solutions to such growing matters 
  do not, and cannot exist in the present political realm, for therein lies the 
  very cause of it all, and the empty rhetoric of the nation's leaders reveal 
  it. And neither do the punitive measures that Americans are led to enact as 
  a response, offer any hope of a solution, but rather serve to reveal the sociological, 
  or shall we say, the pathological cause of the problems themselves. America 
  is a very <a href="../UsedImages/McVeigh.gif">sick society</a>, and the sickness 
  is rooted in the Soul. The disease is a spiritual one, and will require exact 
  spiritual measures to cure it. (The decree of judgment, of course, is nullified 
  as soon as the people repent. The Great Day of Atonement was placed in the Circle 
  of the Year for this very purpose). (Ezekiel 33)...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/LawOfMoses.gif" width="577" height="438"></p>
<p><font size="+1">As this <i>Druid heresy</i> spread across the known world of 
  that time (known to them that is), (and please let us realize that this Jeroboam 
  is not a literal individual, but a literary characterization of the whole state 
  of mind that was governing the mind of Israel at that time), two orders of priests 
  were now abroad in the land. One would increasingly make all the compromises 
  necessary in order to rise to prominence among the people, interpreting the 
  precepts of the law in their own literal ways, and the other would be relegated 
  in time to near obscurity. One would even continue to make animal sacrifices 
  on behalf of the people, as the &quot;written&quot; law and custom required 
  (and it might even offer obscure explanations of them in terms of types and 
  images), and the other would not. The latter would tell the people that they 
  must always be prepared to offer themselves instead. They reasoned from the 
  true oral traditions of Moses, showing how when a beast is drug to the altar 
  alive, it leaves &quot;dead,&quot; but when a person brings themselves to the 
  altar dead (to the higher realities), they depart &quot;alive.&quot; The first 
  order of priests by and large won the day. Becoming friends of the world, and 
  all its fallen ways, they became the enemies of God. (See James 4:4). The other 
  order continued in its own particular way to write the sacred books, and became 
  the dissidents, the outcasts, and the prophets of their times. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">When that later fellowship of Essenes came back up into Europe 
  in the time of Christ, to the regions around Tiferet, or Beauty on the Tree 
  of Life (Acts 3:10), they found their Druid &quot;kinsmen&quot; meeting and 
  worshipping in forest groves, under sacred Oaks, or in clearings opened up to 
  the heavens above. (So far so good, for Nature itself is the true Cathedral 
  of God). But they also found them, in ways befitting their fallen states of 
  mind, sacrificing human beings in various ways, and among them crucifixion. 
  The Romans adopted this method of execution from the Druids, who adopted it 
  from the oral precepts of the Torah: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and 
    he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but 
    thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed 
    of God); that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee 
    for an inheritance...</font></i><font size="+1">(Deuteronomy 21:22,23). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Durant gives something like 
    seventeen references to crucifixion, the earliest instance according to history 
    was Spain, about 200 B.C. Crucifixion was the dishonorable death of a slave...Six 
    thousand slaves were crucified at one time, along the Apian Way about 71 B.C. 
    The custom of crucifying did not rise among the Romans, however. In the many 
    wars of the Romans against the Northern Europeans, the captured Roman soldiers 
    were crucified upon a cross, a Tau cross, made of a tree. (<i>History of Germany</i>, 
    Ellis and Keller). The Romans took up the custom in retaliation. Crucifixion 
    does not appear to be an Asiatic custom, IT BELONGED TO EUROPE.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As all Northern Europe...was under 
    a theocratic Druid control before the conquering Romans took over, it is of 
    grave importance that this regime be examined in some detail to get a full 
    view of Christianity which took such a great part in the fall of the Roman 
    Empire.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Celtic Druids, by Godfrey Higgins, 
    gives the best description of the Druids that may be found today. Caesar only 
    gives a few passages to them. The same goes for other Roman writers. It is 
    known that many Druid priests were gathered on an island together and murdered. 
    It was something like a proscription or a pogrom. It was given out publicly 
    that Druids were murdered by Romans all throughout northern Europe; but no 
    instance is ever given of a Druid being captured or crucified in Rome. This 
    is the inconsistency of History which this book will examine and expose.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the Druid priests of Celtic 
    Gaul and Britain were the leaders of those countries, what could be the name 
    of their followers? What could be the religion of their followers? All that 
    Rome tells us is that they were Barbarians--they name no creed or culture. 
    They do, however, endeavor to belittle them, yet the actions, the purposes, 
    the spirit and equanimity shows them to have been superior to their Roman 
    conquerors. These &quot;followers of the Druids&quot; for lack of a better 
    name, were the people who formed the structure of the Christian religion. 
    Of the above there is no need to quote an authority...Once that thought has 
    gained entrance or admission to examination, the evidence will fall into line 
    with great rapidity, the evidence that the Celtic Druids were Christians and 
    that whether or not there actually lived a Christ, Christianity existed before 
    the time of the given date, and so many persecuted slaves were crucified that 
    there could have been a thousand Christs. </font>(continued)...</p>

<p><font size="+1">Today's church is still sacrificing human lives on the limbs

<p><font size="+1">Who is this <i>man</i>, accursed of God (Ezekiel 1:5; Acts 
  13:38), whose sins are worthy of death? whose Body must be taken down before 
  the Sun sets at the end of the Day? It is plain to see in the oracles that Moses 
  was alluding to the Universal Christ, the great Non-Violent Yajna-Sacrifice 
  of the Vedas, who has come bearing in its Body both the good and the evil in 
  the world, the sins of both the children of Light and the children of Darkness--which 
  is why Western Christianity seems to other peoples of the world to be such a 
  paradox, so full of goodness and so full of wickedness at the very same time. 
  It is because both, the spirits of Cain and Abel, are coming to perfection in 
  the same Mystery, at the same time, and now at the same place. Thus everyone 
  must reconcile themselves to this reality before the Sun sets on the affairs 
  of this age (at the time of the Evening sacrifice), and must absolutely remove 
  their hands from matters of life and death, and especially from the execution 
  of any living being--no matter what the reason. To think or to act otherwise 
  is to align oneself with the very spirit of Antichrist itself. (Understand 2 
  Thessalonians, chapter 2).</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The immediate spiritual power 
    of the Christians was no miracle. Although at first they were persecuted, 
    and Peter and Paul may have been crucified, the resistance to the Romans was 
    worldwide. The organization of the Church appears much too perfect to have 
    been new. The physical organization of the Bishopric, the Elder, the Deacon, 
    the Presbyter, the Church itself sprang into existence miraculously or else 
    it was of previous invention. There is no Roman or Latin or Greek word for 
    Church except Ecclesia. Church is North European, Kirk in Scotland, Kirka 
    in Germany, Church in England. The Druids operated great Circles of which 
    the vast monument in Stonehenge, England, is a physical instance. It was, 
    and is, a Druid Circle, a &quot;pierre druidque.&quot; A small circle of friends--of 
    Christians--was the way the slaves kept their religion alive in Rome. &quot;So 
    that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and 
    faith in all your persecutions&quot; was written before there were any church 
    buildings or organizations except the circle of persons who made up this surreptitious 
    organization...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, in French the circlet was 
    the &quot;Anneau&quot; as in our word Annual. Anna, the girl's name means 
    grace or graceful, and the AN was the name of the Irish pre-historic church. 
    The Celtic word for Ass is Ane (as in Anus) and the symbol of the Church was 
    the ass. Ass and Ane or An, are realistically joined together in Josephus's 
    story of the golden head of the ass held in the temple of An or On, or Heliopolis

    (upon which) all of this...imagery depends, is that Christ is 'the way, the

    the darkness. (Psalms 100, 103:20-23; 111:4). Just as Sunrise makes thieves

<p><font size="+1">It is here that we discern the difference between John's doctrine 
  of Christ and Paul's--between <i>John&quot;s baptism </i>and Paul's (Acts 19:1-7. 
  KJV). John baptised in the name of the Angel of Divine Presence, YHVH (or YHShWH...please 
  see the previous chapter) while Paul taught the doctrine of the Sacrificial 
  Hesus). We do not only discover the name Hesus (later rendered J-esus) affixed 
  to the limbs of the Druid (Cosmic) Tree before the time of Christ, a mystery 
  whose meanings were resurrected by Paul in the time of Christ, but taking the 
  mystery in its entirety, and following it from East to West, we begin to at

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Again, by the <i>Lord of Glory</i> Paul is not referring to 
  any one single person named Jesus alone, but to the Divine Angel's presence 
  in the sum of all living beings. And when he says: <i>If the leaders of the 
  world had known it</i>... he means, if they had ever realized how this Angel 
  of Divine Presence is the same who is born in every human birth and who also 
  dies in every human death, they would have refrained throughout all their centuries 
  from murder, execution, and from the very commission of human warfare itself. 
  They would have refrained from even sitting in places of earthly authority, 
  knowing how these seats have been reserved throughout this age for the children 
  of Darkness. (We are referring to those who have performed these things in the 
  name of the Lord, in violation of the precepts of the Lord. Matthew 20:25-28; 
  1 John 2:18,19. All others are the very Presence of the Lord Himself). And especially 
  would they not have been caught sitting in these seats of authority at this 
  time in history, wherein it is God's intention to rise up in the Presence all 
  those other powers of the Earth--those that God has reserved for Himself against 
  the Day of battle and war--and wherein it is also His intention to set up the 
  throne of His own Anointed ones in the center of Europe. (Psalms 1, and 2; Daniel 
  2:44). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Standing aside with the children of Light, these great leaders 
  might have been able to sense something of God's Terrible and Awful Presence 
  emanating into human consciousness from the center of all these 20th century 
  events. And perhaps, being able to see the power of United States of America 
  in light of the words: <i>Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war 
  with him? </i>(Revelation 13:4), they might also come to sense something of 
  the Power of God's own Strong Right Arm in light of the words:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/pg288sickle.gif" width="59" height="78"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe</i></font><i><font size="+1">,

    is great...</font></i><font size="+1">(Joel 3:13)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The <i>Remnant</i> in every age has always fought against the 
  inability in men to understand these things--being a remnant because, as Abel, 
  they find no commandment, and possess no urge to take the life of any other 
  human being, or to worship at the shrines of any nation on earth. Thus in all 
  the unfolding events of our time the Spirit will answer the question: <i>How 
  hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest the arm that hath no 
  </i>(political or military)<i> strength? </i>(Job 26:2). The Remnant, having 
  no political power as we understand its use in the world--in the everyday, fallen 
  sense of the word--must rely on the Word itself to accomplish its means; and 
  having no means of delivering themselves, must rely on the Divine Presence to 
  rise up and deliver them in the day of Judgment, and not simply themselves but 
  the oppressed everywhere throughout the whole world. Thus Paul wrote:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Now if some believed that the name Jesus, the Greek <img src="../UsedImages/SmallIhsoys.gif" width="76" height="14">, 
  derived from Ies, a Phoenician name for the Sun, it is because the Sun, God's 
  closest, and most Powerful sign of His Own Presence in the material world, provides 
  both the Light and the Life of the whole human family. (John 1:9). It shines 
  inside of us and outside of us, just as God resides both inside of the universe 
  and outside of it. (The Gospel of Thomas 3). And then it is because the mystery 
  of God's Presence in Christ is revealed in the motions of the Sun, from its 
  rising in the East at the time of John the Baptist, to its setting in the West 
  in our days, at the place named Endurance, or Victory, on the Tree of Life. 
  Thus we saw in the preceding chapter, by tracing the course of the Mystery of 
  the Sun of Righteousness across the hidden dimensions of the Oracle, how the 
  Presence of God is revealed in the letters of the Holy Name,YHVH, and how the 
  Name is transformed into the name YHWShWH, or Jehoshua. We now want to see how 
  the name YHWShWH, or YHWShWA (see it in the <i>Concordance </i>to the KJV), 
  Yod-Heh-Vaw-Shin-Vaw-Ayin, (<img src="../UsedImages/yhwshwa.gif" width="89" height="14">) 
  transforms itself conceptually--in the same hieroglyphic and numerical way--into 
  the Greek word, <img src="../UsedImages/SmallIhsoys.gif" width="76" height="14"> 
  or (H)esus, Iesus..</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The initial (H) in the name H-esus derives from the breathing 
  sound of the Fifth Hebrew letter, Heh. It represents the sound of the Spirit 
  who comes and goes as the Breath of God itself, the very same that is transmitted 
  from one soul to another when one greets another with a &quot;holy kiss.&quot; 
  The letter also represents the Right Hand limb of the Tree, or the place numbered 
  Five on the oracles of Life, upon which the Strong Right Arm of the Lord is 
  revealed. The remainder of the word (H)esus derives from the sound of the word 
  <img src="../UsedImages/SmallIhsoys.gif" width="76" height="14"> (or Jesus) 
  itself.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The name, or the word <img src="../UsedImages/SmallIhsoys.gif" width="76" height="14"> 
  contains SIX letters (as does the word YHWShWA), which immediately carries our 
  minds to the center of the Oracle, to where the Mystery of the SON radiates 
  out upon the consciousness of the Western world. Seeing, however, that the sum 
  of these Grecian letters is 888, they also connect our thought to the Eastern 
  mysteries of Hermes-Mercurius-the Thrice-Majestic, which are fulfilled at last 
  in the persons of Moses (Hermes), Paul (Mercurius ..Acts 14:12), and our own 
  king Messiah(s) who shall appear at that place on the Tree of Life named Majesty

  way as the name YHShWH was formulated in ancient times (as it is written, <i>Beware

  Hebrew letter embodies the concept of Divine Unity and the coming together in 
  One. We see it in the oracles of the Tree of Life where both sides of the Tree, 
  the Male side and the Female side, Christian and Jew, come together in the Mystery 
  of Christ:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">When, however, is this reconciliation accomplished? It has 
  been accomplished in the lives of every soul, both male and female, Christian 
  and Jew alike, who have ever entered into the inner spaces of the mystery of 
  Christ-in-them. But the 8th Greek letter, Eta, <img src="../UsedImages/pg291eta.gif" width="10" height="14">, 
  the second letter in the name <img src="../UsedImages/SmallIhsoys.gif" width="76" height="14">,

  (Please understand it in a work entitled <i>The Discourse on the Eighth and 
  the Ninth</i> in the Nag Hammadi Library of books). The people-united will look 
  back from this place together upon the entire epic and be able to observe with 
  their own mind's eye the very Presence of God itself, alive in the grandeur 
  and the majesty of Their own completed work. And when the judgments of this 
  age are passed the people shall ascend together to Jerusalem, to that City which

  or 400. Between the two we find the letter Upsilon, <img src="../UsedImages/Upsilon.gif" width="17" height="16">, 
  which is also equivalent to 400, confirming again what we should find hidden 
  there. The Upsilon is also similar in form to the Hebrew letter Vaw, <img src="../UsedImages/HebrewVaw.gif" width="14" height="16">. 
  Both letters symbolize a merging of two ways, both ways leading to Yesod, or 
  to the Foundation of this great Mystery, and from there to Malkhuth, and the 
  words: <i>Thy Kingdom come, on Earth as it is in Heaven. </i>We can also also 
  discern in these two letters &quot;a parting of the ways,&quot; the ways of 
  Light from the ways of Darkness for instance. The same can be sensed in the 
  symbol of the great Mandala, <img src="../UsedImages/SquareDalets.gif" width="14" height="14">, 
  as it is written: <i>Come up unto the Lord </i>(Exodus 24:1), and:<i> Out of 
  Egypt have I called my Son. </i>(Hosea 11:1; Matthew 2:15).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The number of years that the Son of man was made to lay upon 
  his side totaled 430. (Ezekiel 4:4-8). The additional Thirty years further testify 
  to the dimensions of the Mystery of Christ on the World Tree. <img src="../UsedImages/SquareDalets.gif" width="14" height="14"> 
  = Beauty + Love + Power + Endurance + Majesty = 30, as it is also written: <i>And 
  <img src="../UsedImages/SmallIhsoys.gif" width="76" height="14"> himself began 
  to be about THIRTY </i><i> years of age...</i>(Luke 3:23). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the higher worlds one begets a child, not through physical 
  procreation but through instruction. Thus the seed sown into Mary--that is, 
  into the Waters of life, that is, into the Middle regions of the earth, that 
  is, into the Soul of humanity, having grown up over time--day by day, season 
  by season, year by year, jubilee by jubilee, century by century--finds its completion 
  in the Great Circle of Genesis, <img src="../UsedImages/circle.gif" width="16" height="16">, 
  from the time of Adam to the time of Adam again. Thus the letter Omicron in
