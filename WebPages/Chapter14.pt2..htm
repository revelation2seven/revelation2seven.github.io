<p align="center"><b><i>Now show them the king that they have chosen...</i>(1 
  Samuel. chapter 8).</b></p>
<p><font size="+1">Eight years ago I was devastated at the election of William 
  Clinton and Al Gore to the office of the American Presidency. A pall of Darkness 
  was being drawn over the mind of the people, and every weak and feeble attempt 
  to hold it back seemed utterly fruitless. (All the crying in the wilderness 
  was insufficient). In my own mind it was as if the window of Revelation, which 
  opened during the times of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr., 
  had suddenly shut again, and that the world was now in for another cycle of 
  Darkness. Looking back on it now it even seemed as if Clinton and Gore themselves 
  were unwary players of a sort, that they were not really to be counted among 
  the rulers of this Great Darkness, as those who preceded them in this office, 
  and as those who have now returned to it again. I was tempted to rationalize 
  that they had sold their souls, becoming the warriors and destroyers they seemed 
  not to really be, but for different reasons than the Bush cartel. They seemed 
  to be &quot;really&quot; nice guys, who <i>actually</i> cared about the common 
  people, and that they were in there using the political order in some grand 
  misguided way to attain some greater good--not for themselves and the ruling 
  class, but for others--or so it seemed. (There was no sly wickedness in their 
  grins). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Of course I was mesmerized temporarily, and confused, and wanted 
  to see these two in a different light than the really Dark ones: Carter, Reagan 
  and Bush. Nevertheless, the opportunity was missed, or so it also seemed, and 
  all because of my own spiritual ineptitude I was convinced, my own spiritual 
  failures. The world (the world of my own understanding), seemed to be collapsing 
  around me. Few seemed to be able to share the experience, few stopped to listen, 
  few seemed to be awed or overwhelmed by the events that were unfolding in the 
  earth. Those who were politically and economically aware were at the same time 
  unconcerned about the spiritual and prophetic implications of these events. 
  And those who had a sense of the prophetic import of our times, were either 
  in the fundamentalist camp, or unwilling to explore the scriptures in their 
  correct Light--in the light of the Kabbalah, in the light of the dimensions 
  of the Tree of Life which are the keys to the meaning of things in our time. 
  (By &quot;few&quot; of course, we exempt the &quot;many&quot; who did stop, 
  whose minds and hearts were and are opened to these things, and who are studying 
  in this light, and who are watching for the unfolding of certain events in the 
  world--for the sound of the Trumpet). By &quot;few&quot; we actually mean the 
  many who have a greater stake in the present political, economic and religious 
  order of things than in the righteous order that is coming. Among these Conservatives 
  we include Catholics, Jews, Protestants, Muslims, and the intellectual and liberal 
  elite, the &quot;scholars,&quot; and all others, who, as Paul said, have <i>heaped 
  up teachers unto themselves</i> in these times, 2 Tim.4:3,4). We mean those 
  to whom the words are addressed:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore I speak to them in parables: because they seeing 
    see not and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand...</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears 
    are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they 
    should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand 
    with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them...</font></i><font size="+1">(Matthew 
    13:11-15; Isaiah 6:9,10).</font></p>

    Do you think President Bush, a Christian man, believes or knows he&#146;s 
    involved with prophetic events concerning the Middle East and the final battle 
    between good and evil? James Beaubien<br>
    <br>
    First of all, Billy Graham led George W. Bush Jr. to the Lord Jesus Christ 
    when he visited the White House. President Bush has attended many of Billy 
    Graham&#146;s crusades and during those crusades, Billy Graham always preaches 
    once or twice on Christ&#146;s return and all the prophetical signs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, Rexella and I were in 
    the home of President Bush Senior. What a great time we had with his wife 
    Barbara, in fact, she&#146;s even written us four personal letters and we 
    have them hanging up in our memorabilia room. We gave her the message on video, 
    &#147;The Coming War with Russia&#148; and many of our books to share with 
    her husband, George Bush Sr. Of course, I now have sent the video, &quot;Jerusalem: 
    War or Peace&quot; to all the leaders of our nation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A teacher from Texas who lives 
    down the street from the Bush&#146;s and is a personal friend to them, asked 
    me to come to Texas so I could personally hand him a copy. I said I couldn&#146;t 
    because I&#146;m just swamped with work to do, so she said she&#146;d personally 
    see that he gets a copy. I know that he as seen this video, &#147;Jerusalem: 
    War or Peace&#148;. His brother in Florida, Jeb Bush, has seen it because 
    he wrote me the most heartfelt letter. SO, YES, I THINK GEORGE W. KNOWS THAT 
    HE IS DESTINED FOR THIS FINAL HOUR IN PROPHETIC HISTORY.</font></p>

  <p><b>SEPTEMBER 2003__We could tell you why we think David Corn, a colleague 
    who is Washington Editor of The Nation, has written the perfect book to complete 
    a seasonal trifecta of books on the Liar-in-Chief, but his publisher hits 
    the nail (or liar) on the head: &quot;GEORGE W. BUSH IS A LIAR </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(John 
    8:43,44; John 10:1-13)</font><b>. He has lied large and small, directly and 
    by omission. He has mugged the truth-not merely in honest error, but deliberately, 
    consistently, and repeatedly.&quot;-- from the Introduction</b></p>
  <p><b>All American presidents have lied, but George W. Bush has relentlessly 
    abused the truth. In this scathing indictment of the president and his inner 
    circle, Corn reveals and examines the deceptions at the heart of the Bush 
    presidency. In a stunning work of journalism, he details and substantiates 
    the many times the Bush administration has knowingly and intentionally misled 
    the American public to advance its own interests and agenda, including:</b></p>
  <p><b>* Brazenly mischaracterizing intelligence and resorting to deceptive arguments 
    to whip up public support for war with Iraq * Misrepresenting the provisions 
    and effects of the president's supersized tax cuts * Offering misleading explanations- 
    instead of telling the full truth - about the 9/11 attacks * Lying about connections 
    to corporate crooks * Presenting deceptive and disingenuous claims to sell 
    controversial policies on the environment, stem cell research, missile defense, 
    Social Security, white-collar crime, abortion, energy, and other crucial issues 
    * Running a truth-defying, down-and-dirty campaign during the 2000 presidential 
    contest and recount drama.</b></p>
  <p><b>The Lies of George W. Bush is not a partisan whine -- it is instead a 
    carefully constructed, fact-based account that clearly denotes how Bush has 
    relied on deception -- from the campaign trail to the Oval Office -- to win 
    political and policy battles. With wit and style, Corn explains how Bush has 
    managed to get away with it and explores the dangerous consequences of such 
    presidential deceit in a perilous age.</b></p>

<p><font size="+1">The spell that the Almighty purposed to cast over us was (and 
  is) now upon us. (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, KJV). What was there to do at that 
  time (when Clinton came to power), but retreat into the darkness with everyone 
  else. And while ever mindful of the words that say: <i>In the end it shall speak, 
  and not lie. Wait for it, it shall surely come</i>, it was, nevertheless, a 
  time of great personal crisis and self-doubt. But it was also written: <i>He 
  who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the kingdom of God. 
  </i>So we continued to watch and pray. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And now the cycle has come round again. But we have been assured 
  this time that God's purposes are still being served in these matters, by the 
  high drama, and the focus that God has created everywhere throughout the earth 
  again upon the office of the Presidency, and upon the means men will pursue, 
  and the extents they will go to attain this office. (The analogy of the <i>Scecksies</i> 
  in the <i>Dark Crystal</i> is ever so fitting now). George W. Bush Jr. is preparing 
  throughout this whole spectacle--this struggle to become, as his father before 
  him, the most powerful man on the earth (with the power of Life and Death itself 
  in his very own hands)--to &quot;ascend&quot; to the office. He is waiting for 
  what to him is a foregone conclusion, the final tally of the vote in Florida 
  confirming &quot;himself&quot; as the next President of the United States of 
  America. (The next <i>king</i> of Great Babylon). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I hesitate with all my heart to say it, but Billy Graham was 
  right there again, anointing the next in the ongoing succession of American 
  antichrists. Thus the words: <i>Those who forsake the law will praise the wicked</i>. 
  (Proverbs 28:4,5). George W. Bush called him &quot;a great American,&quot; and 
  &quot;my spiritual mentor,&quot; and so he is. (Please see James 4:4). And while 
  the &quot;number&quot; still devolves upon James Earl Carter (who just recently 
  added to his own sense of himself as the world's chief spokesman to the International 
  Globalist Community, and as the &quot;only real chance for 'peace' and 'justice' 
  in the world&quot;, with his break from the purely American, and purely fundamentalist 
  Southern Baptist Convention), we were hoping at that time, before Clinton became 
  president, that these things would have all come to a climax under the Reagan-Bush 
  administration.<i> </i>The ascendancy of George W. Bush (in so many ways a gift 
  from above for Al Gore, if he will accept it. He and Clinton have dodged a bullet, 
  as it is), is a fulfillment of that wish. The &quot;skull and crossbones&quot; 
  will not only be raised again in the Oval Office, and George Bush Sr.'s Gulf 
  War gang will not only be back in power </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(continued)</font><font size="+1">...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON_Early last year, when 
    George W. Bush was just beginning to put together his presidential campaign, 
    he invited some of the top foreign policy luminaries from previous Republican 
    administrations to the governor's mansion in Texas for a chat.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm going to be the next 
    president of the United States, and I need your help,&quot; one of those present, 
    former Pentagon official Richard Perle, recalls Bush telling the group. &quot;Not 
    to become president--I'll take care of that. But to be a good president...I 
    have to deal effectively with the nation's security and manage its foreign 
    policy, and I appreciate your willingness to help me master those issues.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The anecdote reflects a number 
    of things about the man who will be formally anointed on Thursday as the Republican 
    nominee for president. One is Bush's supreme confidence about the outcome 
    of the long campaign. &quot;This is a person who can actually see himself 
    as being president, and he is thinking today about actions to take that would 
    be important as president,&quot; says Robert Zoellick, a former State Department 
    official who has become one of Bush's advisers on foreign policy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But another is Bush's relative 
    lack of experience on international and national security issues, and his 
    recognition of the need to bone up on those questions with specialists such 
    as Perle...and others who advised Bush's father or President Ronald Reagan. 
    Those advisers were selected for him by another old Bush administration hand, 
    Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, who is now about to become the nominee's 
    running mate...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a series of recent speeches, 
    Bush has taken specific positions on a number of important international and 
    security issues. From these speeches, as well as the comments of his main 
    advisers, it is possible to glimpse the outlines of what a Bush foreign and 
    defense policy would look like. It would include:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A tougher approach to Russia and 
    China than that of the Clinton administration.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A commitment to building a much 
    more ambitious missile defense system than the present administration has 
    proposed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A comprehensive review of U.S. 
    nuclear forces and strategy that could result in a drastic unilateral reduction 
    in the number of missiles and warheads.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A more restrictive view of when

<p><font size="+1"></font><font size="+1">...but the (wholly unstable) American 
  electorate will in some ways more fittingly get the leader they want and deserve. 
  <i>Nay, but we will have a king over us</i>. (1 Samuel, chapter 8). Oh it is 
  true that William Clinton truly loved being king, what with his own imposing 
  figure that he was so enamored with, his own delusions of grandeur, his initial 
  beliefs that he could change the system of things, which he soon abandoned for 
  the lights and the glamour of the office itself. And oh those motorcades that 
  carried him here and there (constantly disrupting the lives of everyone around 
  him), to the always present refrain of <i>Hail Caesar!</i> William Clinton loved 
  it all, and imagined it all. (And it is no doubt true that Al Gore would have 
  loved it all too, even while trying to be the good leader--in the most liberal 
  sense of it all). But America is about the fulfillment of God's design; it is 
  about the mind of <i>Man</i> coming to spiritual perfection, and about the sanctification 
  of the Name of Christ and the perfection of God's Word in the earth. It is about 
  Light emerging from Darkness. It is about purging the Universal Israel of all 
  of its worldly dross, and of every slightest propensity it may ever have in 
  the future for reverting again to the ways of this present world and the evils 
  of this age.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Those on the Left will be purged as it is with the reemergence 
  of Jimmy Carter who, like themselves, professes a much higher vision for both 
  America and the world, but one just as deadly in the end. The end of this age 
  is all about war, as it is written: <i>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley 
  of decision; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of Decision, </i>(Joel 
  3:14). And despite Carter's voluminous talk of peace he is at heart an &quot;extreme 
  warrior.&quot; Like Woodrow Wilson before him, he, and all those who share his 
  global ambitions, will resort to war in the end, in the mighty effort to preserve 
  the American ethos, to save the Western World and to bring about his own vision 
  of peace in the earth. It is the spirit of Cain, in its most subtle perfection, 
  versus the Word of God itself--which has reserved no place in itself for those 
  who are friends of this present world (James 4:1-6), and who can find any justification 
  whatsoever to commit violence in the name of Christ.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">This particular election, however, is about purging those on 
  the Right from their wholly idolatrous, greedy and fearful, and not to fail 
  to mention their wholly ignorant spiritual ways, making them fit to stand at 
  last in the presence of God's truly Anointed Ones. (Understand Isaiah 4:1,2). 
  Thus America at home, the blatantly militaristic state that it is (as one commentator 
  put it: &quot;with its Rambo heart and its Terminator head&quot;), even though 
  it may have cast a majority vote for Gore, will now have blatant militarists, 
  capitalists and <i>Ba'al worshipping </i>nationalists as their own leaders--and 
  in the end for their own eternal good. A Bush administration will not blur the 
  lines between good and evil as a Gore administration would have (and as Carter 
  masterfully does in the eyes of the rest of the world). With its outright emphasis 
  on &quot;American&quot; as opposed to &quot;human&quot; values, with a program 
  of full scale economic development at the expense of the well-being of the planet, 
  and with its ungodly concern for national security, a Bush administration will 
  heighten the contrast between the children of Light and the children of Darkness 
  in this land. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(These things

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thought the Cold War was over? 
    Think again.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, 
    has been goading the West for months, and new reports--which first appeared 
    this week in the Washington Times--suggest the provocation may be verging 
    on nuclear. Literally.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reports are based on U.S. intelligence 
    assessments--and they prompt chilly memories of the Evil Empire for more than 
    a few people. Starting with those in Warsaw and the Baltic states.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the report, Moscow 
    is secretly deploying tactical nuclear weapons in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, 
    in range of Poland and Lithuania--and in violation of Russian pledges to keep 
    the area nuclear-free. Moscow denies it...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If the Russians have placed 
    tactical nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad, it would violate their pledge...&quot; 
    a Pentagon spokesman said. He added that Washington would take up the matter 
    with Russian officials. Rep. Ben Gilman (R-NY) went further, saying a transfer 
    of nuclear weapons would be &quot;an alarming development that threatens the 
    new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.&quot; No kidding.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The weapons are believed to have 
    limited military value. But the symbolism isn't lost on anyone.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, now, wait a minute: Officials 
    say the administration learned of the reports back in June. So why are the 
    Clinton folks just raising the matter now? Yes, there was an election in between. 
    But would Team Clinton have sought to put off the issue so as not to cause 
    a public rift with Moscow and damage Al Gore's and Hillary's prospects for 
    victory at the polls? It's hard to fathom even the Clinton folks would go 
    that far--but it sure is a scary thought.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, Putin has cozied up 
    to Fidel Castro, sent arplanes to buzz a U.S. aircraft carrier, restored the 
    Soviet National anthem and cracked down on the press. Shades of the Cold War? 
    You'd better believe it.</font></p>

  humanity, and against the Gospel are very great among them, as Paul called it: 
  <i>Spiritual wickedness in high places...</i>Ephesians 6:12), there is sure 
  to be widespread crime below, among the people themselves. As the head thinks, 
  the body acts. The amount of disorder below is directly related to the amount 
  of wickedness above. If there is killing and murder below it is because those 
  above are killers and murderers as well. And the more those above seek to cover 
  up their own crimes by diverting attention to crimes below, the more crime does 
  God Himself commit against them, and against their order of things. <i>Shall 
  there be evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it? </i>(Amos 3:6). They 
  are spiritual children who do not understand these things, as it is also written: 
  <i>Woe to them who say the Lord will do neither good nor evil</i>. (Zephaniah 
  1:12). And the more those in high political and judicial places seek to quell 
  the plague that God sends among them, through prosecution and punishment, retribution

    what he preaches every day of his life, and it made him question then, 'Do

  <p align="center"><b>by Richard Cohen</b></p>
  <p><b>Leigh Anne Gideon is a former reporter for the Huntsville (Tex.) Item. 
    Huntsville is where Texas has its death house, and since 1924, all the state's 
    executions have taken place there. Gideon has witnessed some of them, sometimes 
    along with members of the condemned man's family.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;You'll never hear another sound like a mother wailing when she's 
    watching her son being executed,&quot; she says. &quot;There is no sound like 
    it. It is just this horrendous wail.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>Contrast that sound bite, taken from a National Public Radio documentary 
    called &quot;Witness to an Execution,&quot; with what George W. Bush said 
    in the second presidential debate. The subject had turned to the lynching 
    of James Byrd, a black man who had been dragged to death, and Al Gore made 
    reference to the alleged need for a hate crime law.</b></p>
  <p><b>Bush hit him back: &quot;The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess 
    what's going to happen to them? They're going to be put to death. A jury found 
    them guilty and--it's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they 
    get put to death. And it's the right cause, so it's the right decision,&quot; 
    Bush smiled...The remark showed Bush at his most callow. THE SUBJECT, AFTER 
    ALL, WAS DEATH.</b></p>
  <p><b>For Bush that was hardly an uncharacteristic moment. Earlier in the campaign, 
    he mocked Karla Faye Tucker, the pick axe murderer who had become a born-again 
    Christian and had pleaded for her life. &quot;Please don't kill me,&quot; 
    he mimicked her in an interview with Tucker Carlson of Talk magazine. Bush 
    said he was misrepresented. His smile at the debate said otherwise.</b></p>
  <p><b>BUSH'S POSITION ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OFFERS A WINDOW INTO WHO HE REALLY 
    IS. There is something both remarkable and depressing about a man who has 
    presided over more executions than any other governor--145 so far--and seems 
    not to have given the matter much thought.</b></p>
  <p><b>It does not bother Bush that Texas executes the mentally feeble and the 
    mentally ill. It does not bother him that its appeals court seems merely to 
    dust the capital punishment cases that go before it--sustaining almost all 
    of them. It does not bother him that Texas juries do not have the option of 
    voting life without parole or that indigent defendants are sometimes represented 
    by hacks who, like buzzards, hang around murder cases hoping for some scraps.</b></p>
  <p><b>The system is a mess, only Bush seems not to have noticed. His deepest 
    research is into his own feelings, don't question his heart.</b></p>
  <p><b>He reminds me of acquaintances whose therapists assured them they were, 
    down where the id, ego and superego are stored, really good people. In Bush's 
    case, it is not psychotherapy but religion that sustains his swollen self-regard. 
    Still, he might wonder why so many executions have not made Texas any safer 
    than anywhere else...</b></p>
  <p><b>Bush has presided over 35 executions this year alone, with the total likely 
    to hit 50. The sheer volume has taken a toll on the very people who man Huntsville's

    team, said he couldn't take it any longer </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(and

    was just so many of them,&quot; he told NPR. He quit.</b></p>
  <p><b>The pace, the numbers--maybe the sheer futility of the awful task--have 
    even gotten to the warden, Jim Willett. &quot;There are times when I'm standing 
    there watching those fluids start to flow and wonder whether what we're doing

  their own names to the other sons of Darkness who have preceded them. How is 
  it they have failed to understand? God is not American, and has no regard for 
  America's global agenda. The Law and the Prophets are a living testimony against 
  it. (See Revelation 18). Nor is God a Conservative--in any Anglo-American political 
  and economic sense of the term. They, the Divine Father and Mother, care very 
  little for America's conservative agenda. They think very little of a death 
  penalty in the name of Their Son--of violence of any sort in the name of Their 
  Son. Despite Their forebearance and longsuffering (as well as Their paradoxical 
  complicity in all of these matters), they are jealous for the earth and for

  <p><b>My favorite line by the Bushies is: How Dare They Call Him Stupid?...This 
    is getting to be the problem that dare not speak its name.</b></p>
  <p><b>I am fully persuaded that Bush's performance in the third debate was a 
    cry for help. Go back and listen just to Bush's answers and see what you think...(&quot;You 
    want pop-psychology, I'll give you pop-psychology&quot;).</b></p>
  <p><b>I think Bush threw that debate. Consciously or unconsciously, the poor 
    man knows that he is not prepared to be President of the United States, and 
    he is desperately trying to signal us to that effect.</b></p>
  <p><b>George W. Bush is the unexamined candidate, and the extent to which he 
    is unexamined gets eerier as Election Day approaches. At least half the country

    a nice fella.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>I LIKE HIM myself. But he is often clueless, he does not have a nice record, 
    and the idea of electing him President scares the living fantods out of me...George 
    W. is running on the excellent platform that he trusts us. Fine, but why should 
    we trust him?</b></p>

    does he think we are? As Al Hunt wrote in his Wall Street Journal column: 
    &quot;The GOP nominee claims his tax measures principally will help the working 
    poor and middle class America. The rich, he says, will get a smaller percentage 
    than they currently do, and the tax plan fits comfortably with projected budget 
    surpluses and his Social Security plans. None of that is true.&quot;...</b></p>

    <p align="center"><b>A SLICK MIX</b></p>
    <p align="center"><b>By Bob Herbert</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>It was disheartening to see Colin Powell up there doing his bit to help 
    mask the reality of the G.O.P., a party that since the 1960's has been relentlessly 
    hostile to the interests of black Americans.</b></p>
  <p><b>This was on Monday night, when you couldn't tell whether you were at the 
    Republican National Convention or the Motown Review. The number of blacks 
    paraded before a national television audience by this nearly all-white convention 
    was incredible. The delegates are mostly 90 percent white, mostly male and 
    rigidly conservative. So it was a breathtaking exercise in hypocrisy for them 
    to haul so many blacks before the cameras for the sole purpose of singing, 
    dancing, preaching and praising a party that has wanted no part of them. (<i>They 
    are mad upon their idols</i>).</b></p>
  <p><b>General Powell used some of his time to urge the party to become more 
    inclusive, and chastised it for opposing affirmative action. But he nevertheless 
    was the featured performer in the cynical lineup of blacks and other minorities 
    that was put together in a blatant effort to cast the party as something it 
    is not. If you looked at the stage during this farce, and then turned and 
    looked at the audience, you saw two entirely different worlds. The makeover 
    artists of the G.O.P. put together a slick mix of race, religion and culture 
    and used it for all the wrong reasons. It was exploitative and demeaning. 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The Republicans still aren't interested in blacks. They are simply trying 
    to present a friendlier, more moderate face to white, middle-class swing voters 
    who have been put off by the party's excesses over the past several years.</b></p>
  <p><b>If the Republicans really wanted to embrace black voters (and not just 
    black children at photo ops) they would honestly address such things as Dick 
    Chaney's voting record; George W. Bush's campaign appearance at Bob Jones 
    University; George Herbert Walker Bush's use of the disgraceful Willie Horton 
    (let's-scare-the-white-folks) campaign ads; President Bush's cynical selection 
    of Clarance Thomas for the Supreme Court; and the G.O.P.'s viciously anti-black 
    Southern strategy, which has been a divisive force in American politics for 
    more than 30 years.</b></p>
  <p><b>If the Republicans were serious they would reassess the many long years 
    they spent attacking programs for children and the elderly and the sick, and 
    demonizing Democrats and liberals for attempting to help minorities and the 
    poor.</b></p>
  <p><b>But they are not serious. They are engaged in a four-day charade, an exercise 
    in duplicity that included the shameless theft of the slogan &quot;Leave no 
    child behind,&quot; which was the registered trademark of the Children's Defense 
    fund, a favorite GOP target.</b></p>
  <p><b>George W. Bush says that he is a &quot;different&quot; kind of Republican. 
    But different from what? We need to know what it was about the Republican 
    Party of the last several decades that he thinks should be changed.</b></p>
  <p><b>Does he think Republican policies need to change, or just that Republican 
    candidates should hug more black children?</b></p>
  <p><b>Republicans have long favored enormous tax cuts that served the dual purpose 
    of providing bonanzas for the wealthy and bleeding the government of funds 
    that could be used to help the less fortunate. Does Mr. Bush think that should 
    change?</b></p>
  <p><b>Most of the Republicans I spoke with this week found it difficult to think 
    of anything substantive about their party that should change. Representative 
    John Kasich, a conservative Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget 
    Committee, was typical.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;We believe in less government,&quot; he said.</b></p>
  <p><b>I asked what he thought Mr. Bush meant when he talked about a &quot;different&quot; 
    kind of Republican. Mr. Kasich looked uncomfortable. &quot;I don't know,&quot; 
    he said. &quot;I don't know. You'd have to ask George Bush how he's different.&quot;

    GRAND STRATEGIST</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Toney Blankley 
    <br>
    February 11, 2004</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Boston Globe -- the respected, 
    liberal newspaper owned by the New York Times -- ran an article last week 
    that Bush critics might wish to read carefully. It is a report on a new book 
    that argues that President Bush has developed and is ably implementing only 
    the third American grand strategy in our history,</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The author of this book, &quot;Surprise, 
    Security, and the American Experience &lt;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674011740/townhallcom/&gt;&quot; 
    (Harvard Press), which is to be released in March, is John Lewis Gaddis, the 
    Robert A. Lovett professor of military and naval history at Yale University. 
    The Boston Globe describes Professor Gaddis as &quot;the dean of Cold War 
    studies and one of the nation's most eminent diplomatic historians.&quot; 
    In other words, this is not some put up job by an obscure right-wing author. 
    This comes from the pinnacle of the liberal Ivy League academic establishment.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you hate George W. Bush, you 
    will hate this Boston Globe story, because it makes a strong case that George 
    Bush stands in a select category with Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
    and James Monroe (as guided by his secretary of state, John Q. Adams) in implementing 
    one of the only three grand strategies of American foreign policy in our two-century 
    history.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As the Globe article describes, 
    in reporting on the book and an interview with Professor Gaddis, &quot;Grand 
    strategy is the blueprint from which policy follows. It envisions a country's 
    mission, defines its interests and sets its priorities. Part of grand strategy's 
    grandeur lies in its durability: A single grand strategy can shape decades, 
    even centuries of policy.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> According to this analysis, the 
    first grand strategy by Monroe/Adams followed the British invasion of Washington 
    and the burning of the White House in 1814. They responded to that threat 
    by developing a policy of gaining future security through territorial expansion 
    -- filling power vacuums with American pioneers before hostile powers could 
    get in. That strategy lasted throughout the 19th and the early 20th centuries, 
    and accounts for our continental size and historic security.</font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FDR's plans for the post WWII 
    period was the second grand strategy, and gained American security by establishing 
    free markets and self determination in Europe as a safeguard against future 
    European wars, while creating the United Nations and related agencies to help 
    us manage the rest of the world and contain the Soviets. The end of the Cold 
    War changed that and led, according to Professor Gaddis, to President Clinton's 
    assumption that a new grand strategy was not needed because globalization 
    and democratization were inevitable. &quot;Clinton said as much at one point. 
    I think that was shallow. I think they were asleep at the switch,&quot; Professor 
    Gaddis observed.</font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That brings the professor to George 
    W. Bush, who he describes as undergoing &quot;one of the most surprising transformations 
    of an underrated national leader since Prince Hal became Henry V.&quot; Clearly, 
    Professor Gaddis has not been a longtime admirer of George Bush. But he is 
    now. He observes that Bush &quot;undertook a decisive and courageous reassessment 
    of American grand strategy following the shock of the 9/11 attacks. At his 
    doctrine's center, Bush placed the democratization of the Middle East and 
    the urgent need to prevent terrorists and rogue states from getting nuclear 
    weapons. Bush also boldly rejected the constraints of an outmoded international 
    system that was really nothing more than a snapshot of the configuration of 
    power that existed in 1945.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is worth noting that John Kerry 
    and the other Democrats' central criticism of President Bush -- the prosaic 
    argument that he should have taken no action without U.N. approval -- is implicitly 
    rejected by Professor Gaddis as being a proposed policy that would be constrained 
    by an &quot;outmoded international system.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In assessing Bush's progress to 
    date, The Boston Globe article quotes Professor Gaddis: &quot;so far the military 
    action in Iraq has produced a modest improvement in American and global economic 
    conditions; an intensified dialogue within the Arab world about political 
    reform; a withdrawal of American forces from Saudi Arabia; and an increasing 
    nervousness on the part of the Syrian and Iranian governments as they contemplated 
    the consequences of being surrounded by American clients or surrogates. The 
    United States has emerged as a more powerful and purposeful actor within the 
    international system than it had been on September 11, 2001.&quot;</font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In another recent article, written 
    before the Iraqi war, Professor Gaddis wrote that: &quot;BUSH'S GRAND STRATEGY 
    IS ACTUALLY LOOKING TOWARD THE CULMINATION OF THE WILSONIAN PROJECT OF A WORLD 
    SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY, even in the Middle East. And this long-term dimension 
    of it, it seems to me, goes beyond what we've seen in the thinking of more 
    recent administrations. It is more characteristic of the kind of thinking, 
    say, that the Truman administration was doing at the beginning of the Cold 
    War ... &quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Is President Bush becoming an 
    historic world leader in the same category as President Franklin Roosevelt, 
    as the eminent Ivy League professor argues? Or is he just a lying nitwit, 
    as the eminent Democratic Party chairman and Clinton fundraiser Terry McAuliffe 
    argues? I suspect that as this election year progresses, that may end up being 
    the decisive debate. You can put me on the side of the professor.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>THE PRESIDENT IS READING A BOOK, I'M AFRAID</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>by Robert Higgs</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>President George W. Bush has been been reading a book. At least, he claims 
    to have been reading one. I know what you're thinking, but the First Shrub 
    swears that he has been reading more than the funny papers lately. We'd all 
    be be better off, however, if he had stuck to the comics.</b></p>
  <p><b>In an interview with an Associated Press reporter, Bush said that on his 
    vacation he had been reading a recently published book by Eliot A. Cohen, 
    <i>The Supreme Command: Soldiers, Statesmen and Leadership in Wartime</i>. 
    Cohen is a well-known neocon warhawk and all-around armchair warrior who professes 
    &quot;strategic studies&quot; at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced 
    International Studies and, in his spare time, ponders mega-deaths (his own 
    not included) with other lusty members of the Defense Policy Board. The quintessential 
    civilian go-getter, he never met a war he didn't want to send somebody else 
    to fight and die in.</b></p>
  <p><b><i>The Supreme Command</i> consists of case studies of how four &quot;statesmen&quot;--Abraham 
    Lincoln, Georges Clemenceau, Winston Churchill, and David Ben-Gurion--successfully 
    managed to make their generals act more vigorously than those officers really 
    wanted to act. By spurring their too-timid generals, these four micro-managing 
    commanders-in-chief supposedly got superior results from their war-making 
    efforts. The common soldiers who were fed into the consuming maw of war under 
    these worthies might have given us a different opinion, but dead men don't 
    make good critics.</b></p>
  <p><b>So, what are we to make of Bush's reading of this book, assuming that 
    he really has been reading it? The short answer is that this is not good news 
    for the world. Such reading seems calculated to bend the president's mind, 
    never a mighty organ in any event, toward thinking of himself in Lincolnian 
    or Churchillian terms. Indeed, those of us who have had the stomach to observe 
    his public strutting and puffing since September 11 might have suspected that 
    his juvenile sensitivities would be drawn all too readily toward such a grandiose 
    self-conception. After all, does he but speak, and mighty armadas are launched 
    on a global war against evil?</b></p>
  <p><b>As he clears brush at his Texas digs and takes jogs with the Secret Service 
    boys, Bush may fancy that his cut from the same cloth as his Republican predecessor 
    Theodore Roosevelt--he of the strenuous life and the more-than-a-bit-balmy 
    conception of man's relation to his fellow man, most of whom he would glady 
    crush like bugs under his manly jackboots. Why worry, the current president 
    might be thinking, about the views of a wimp such as Colin Powell? What does 
    he know about war, in comparison with, say, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, 
    whose heroic military service service has long been the stuff of legend? </b></p>
  <p><b>Unfortunately for the world, the president's bedtime perusal of Cohen's 
    <i>Supreme Command</i> may set his childish imagination aflame with visions 
    of Great Statesmanship. &quot;Damn,&quot; he may think, expelling a masculine 
    expletive, &quot;I too can be a Lincoln or a Churchill.&quot; Devoutly may 
    we all hope that the opportunity evades him, for both of these storied &quot;statesmen&quot; 
    were monsters whose hands were stained beyond cleansing with innocent blood. 
    Yet a man would need an adult sensibility to understand such realities, and 
    Bush II, it seems clear, has a mind that never matured, if indeed it had the 
    potential for such maturation in the first place. Manifestly, he is but a 
    boy playing with immense, lethal toys. Yet when he says jump, legions of heavily 
    armed men ask: how high?</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Study of Bush's Psyche Touches a Nerve<br>
  By Julian Borger</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>The Guardian Wednesday 13 August 2003</b></p>
  <p><b>A study funded by the US government has concluded that conservatism can 
    be explained psychologically as a set of neuroses rooted in &quot;fear and 
    aggression, dogmatism and the intolerance of ambiguity&quot;. As if that was 
    not enough to get Republican blood boiling, the report's four authors linked 
    Hitler, Mussolini, Ronald Reagan and the rightwing talkshow host, Rush Limbaugh, 
    arguing they all suffered from the same affliction. All of them &quot;preached 
    a return to an idealised past and condoned inequality&quot;.</b></p>
  <p><b>Republicans are demanding to know why the psychologists behind the report, 
    Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition, received $1.2m in public 
    funds for their research from the National Science Foundation and the National 
    Institutes of Health. The authors also peer into the psyche of President George 
    Bush, who turns out to be a textbook case. The telltale signs are his preference 
    for moral certainty and frequently expressed dislike of nuance.</b></p>
  <p><b>&quot;This intolerance of ambiguity can lead people to cling to the familiar, 
    to arrive at premature conclusions, and to impose simplistic cliches and stereotypes,&quot; 
    the authors argue in the Psychological Bulletin. One of the psychologists 
    behind the study, Jack Glaser, said the aversion to shades of grey and the 
    need for &quot;closure&quot; could explain the fact that the Bush administration 
    ignored intelligence that contradicted its beliefs about Iraq's weapons of 
    mass destruction. The authors, presumably aware of the outrage they were likely 
    to trigger, added a disclaimer that their study &quot;does not mean that conservatism 
    is pathological or that conservative beliefs are necessarily false&quot;.</b></p>
  <p><b>Another author, Arie Kruglanski, of the University of Maryland, said he 
    had received hate mail since the article was published, but he insisted that 
    the study &quot;is not critical of conservatives at all&quot;. &quot;The variables 
    we talk about are general human dimensions,&quot; he said. &quot;These are 
    the same dimensions that contribute to loyalty and commitment to the group. 
    Liberals might be less intolerant of ambiguity, but they may be less decisive, 
    less committed, less loyal.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>But what drives the psychologists? George Will, a Washington Post columnist 
    who has long suffered from ingrained conservatism, noted, tartly: &quot;The 
    professors have ideas; the rest of us have emanations of our psychological 
    needs and neuroses.&quot;</b></p>

  <p><b>George Bush told lies and they died.</b></p>
  <p><b>First, your government lied to ensure Bush's re-election. Who votes against 
    a president in time of war? And even better, you get oil with the winning 
    election. So Bush lied to you. Not misstatements. Lies. He and his people 
    threw away their honor and consciences to lie to the people they had sworn 
    to protect. The lies of Washington put young men from Seymour, Tenn., and 
    Maspeth, Queens and Palos Hills, Ill., into boxes. And that, dear reader, 
    is quite a lie.</b></p>
  <p><b>At the start, Bush claimed that Iraq had poison gas and was making nuclear 
    weapons. Soon, they will poison us all and blow us up. His proof was documents 
    forged by elementary-school pupils. Still, Bush used it in his State of the 
    Union speech. Condoleezza Rice said it was only 23 words in a speech. What 
    are you so concerned about? The 23 words were only about nuclear bombs.</b></p>
  <p><b>Look now at the lie that George Bush carries into the United Nations today: 
    We went into Iraq because they were part of the World Trade Center attack. 
    That's what they told you, and Americans, who honor their government, believed 
    what their government told them. And so did all those young people as they 
    were about to put up their lives in the desert.</b></p>
  <p><b>On Oct. 14, 2002, Bush said, &quot;This is a man [Saddam] that we know 
    has had connections with al-Qaida. This is a man who, in my judgment, would 
    like to use al-Qaida as a forward army.&quot; Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 
    said, on Sept. 26, 2002, &quot;Yes, there is a linkage between al-Qaida and 
    Iraq.&quot; Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said on Sept. 
    25, 2002, &quot;There have been contacts between senior Iraqi officials and 
    members of al-Qaida going back for actually quite a long time.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>They knew exactly what they were saying and what it would do. It was using 
    a Big Lie in an age of screens and faxes. What did you think it was, a government 
    telling you the truth? Why should they do that? At summer's end, suspicions 
    rose. It was time to change the lie before it became a liability. How do you 
    do that? By using the ultimate con: telling the truth.</b></p>
  <p><b>Here in the world of professional lying is how you use the truth to defuse 
    a lie when it becomes dangerous to keep: Suddenly, Donald Rumsfeld on Sept. 
    16 announced, &quot;I've not seen any indication that would lead me to believe 
    that I could say that Saddam Hussein was involved in the Sept. 11 attacks.&quot; 
    That same day, Condoleezza Rice jumped up and chirped, &quot;And we have never 
    claimed that Saddam Hussein had either ... direction or control of 9/11. What 
    we've said is that this was someone who supported terrorists, helped train 
    them.&quot; And then the next day, George Bush said, &quot;There's no question 
    that Saddam Hussein has al-Qaida ties. We have no evidence that Saddam Hussein 
    was involved with the Sept. 11 attacks.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b>So the three now say that they never said that Hussein was involved in 
    the World Trade Center attack. Look up what we said. We never said it. Of 
    course they did. Anybody who thinks they didn't is a poor fool. Take a half-word 
    out of a sentence, replace it with a smug smile or chin motion and the meaning 
    is there. Saddam was in on the Trade Center with bin Laden. Of course Bush 
    and his people said it. Then go to the whip, go to the truth.</b></p>
  <p><b>Only the strong memory is an opponent, and there are few of them. Otherwise, 
    the only thing that can remind people and maybe even inflame them are these 
    dead bodies coming back from Iraq to Heber, Calif. They arrive here in silence. 
    We have no idea of how many wounded are in government hospitals with no arms 
    or legs. You never hear Bush talking about them. He often acts as if subjects 
    like this have nothing to do with him. </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Copyright

<p align="center"><font size="+1">BUSH SAYS GOD CHOSE HIM TO LEAD HIS NATION</font></p>
<p align="center"><b>By Paul Harris<br>
  The Observer - UK<br>
  11-2-03</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Book Reveals How President's Religious And Political Beliefs Are Entwined 
    - And Claims He Did Pray With Blair.</b></p>
  <p><b>NEW YORK -- President George W. Bush stood before a cheering crowd at 
    a Dallas Christian youth centre last week, and told them about being 'born 
    again' as a Christian. 'If you change their heart, then they change their 
    behaviour. I know,' he said, referring to his own conversion, which led to 
    him giving up drinking. Behind Bush were two banners. 'King of Kings', proclaimed 
    one. 'Lord of Lords', said the other. The symbolism of how fervent Christianity 
    has become deeply entwined with the most powerful man on the planet could 
    not have been stronger. </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="../UsedImages/BushHalo.jpg" width="217" height="281"></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Few US Presidents have been as openly religious as Bush. Now a new book 
    has lifted the lid on how deep those Christian convictions run. It will stir 
    up controversy at a time when the administration is keen to portray its 'war 
    on terror' as non-religious. The book, which depicts a President who prays 
    each day and believes he is on a direct mission from God, will give ammunition 
    to critics who claim Bush's administration is heavily influenced by extremist 
    Christians.</b></p>
  <p><b> Bush is already under fire for allowing the appointment of General William 
    Boykin to head the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Boykin, who speaks at evangelical 
    Christian meetings, once said the war on terror was a fight against Satan, 
    and also told a Somali warlord that, 'My God was bigger than his. I knew that 
    my God was a real God and his was an idol.' <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Bush has also been accused of a 'creeping Christianisation' of federal 
    government programmes. In September, the government made more than $60 billion 
    available for religious charitable groups. Critics say the groups will be 
    able to use the cash to promote their religion. One group that benefited from 
    previous grants was an Iowa prison project that entitled inmates to televisions, 
    private bathrooms and computers - in return for Christian counselling. Now 
    Bush is likely to face intense scrutiny. The book, The Faith of George W. 
    Bush, was written by Christian author Stephen Mansfield. It details numerous 
    incidents where Bush's faith has been shown to be at the centre of his political 
    thinking. Among Mansfield's revelations is his insistence that Bush and Tony 
    Blair have prayed together at a private meeting at Camp David. Blair has previously 
    denied this. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Mansfield, however, says that, while there were no witnesses, aides were 
    left in little doubt as to what had happened. He told The Observer: 'There 
    is no question they have shared scripture and prayed together.' The book also 
    shows that in the lead-up to announcing his candidacy for the presidency, 
    Bush told a Texan evangelist that he had had a premonition of some form of 
    national disaster happening. Bush said to James Robinson: 'I feel like God 
    wants me to run for President. I can't explain it, but I sense my country 
    is going to need me. Something is going to happen... I know it won't be easy 
    on me or my family, but God wants me to do it.' <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>In another incident, Mansfield recounts how, on Palm Sunday last year, 
    Bush was flying back from El Salvador aboard the presidential jet Air Force 
    One and seemed to be destined to miss church. However, knowing that Bush hated 
    to miss a service, some officials suggested they worship in the air. Bush 
    agreed, and soon 40 officials were crammed into the plane's conference room. 
    The service was led by National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, while the 
    lesson was read by close Bush aide Karen Hughes. <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The author also proves anecdotes about Bush that had previously been dismissed 
    as false. Rumours that he had prayed with a young soldier who had lost a hand 
    in Iraq were thought to be myth, but Mansfield tracked down witnesses and 
    a hospital chaplain who said that Bush had prayed with the man, ending by 
    kissing him on the forehead and telling him he loved him. 'For me, that sums 
    up Bush's beliefs. He really believes Jesus is taken up in his heart and soul,' 
    Mansfield said. <br>

  <b>BUSH IS THE 'GREATEST THREAT TO LIFE ON THE PLANET' SAYS THE MAYOR OF LONDON</b><br>
</p>
<p align="center"><b>By Nigel Morris<br>
  Home Affairs Correspondent <br>
  The Independent - UK<br>

<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, launched a stinging attack on President 
    George Bush last night, denouncing him as THE&quot;GREATEST THREAT TO LIFE 
    ON THIS PLANETTHAT WE'VE MOST PROBABLY EVER SEEN.&quot; His provocatively 
    timed comments, on the eve of Mr Bush's arrival in London tonight, threaten 
    to create severe embarrassment for the Prime Minister. They also come with 
    talks under way on whether to re-admit Mr Livingstone to the Labour Party 
    before his five-year exile ends. Although he made his many differences with 
    the Government on a range of issues clear, he reserved his strongest comments 
    for the American President in an interview with The Ecologist magazine. </b></p>
  <p><b>The President's three-night trip, which will culminate on Friday with 
    a visit to the Prime Minister's Sedgefield constituency, has sparked a flood 
    of protests from those opposed to his foreign policy. But Mr Livingstone's 
    outburst makes him one of the most high-profile and explicit of his critics. 
    Mr Livingstone recalled a visit at Easter to California, where he was denounced 
    for an attack he had made on what he called &quot;THE MOST CORRUPT AND RACIST 
    AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION IN OVER 80 YEARS&quot;. He said: &quot;Some US journalist 
    came up to me and said: 'How can you say this about President Bush?' Well, 
    I think what I said then was quite mild. I actually think that Bush is the 
    greatest threat to life on this planet that we've most probably ever seen. 
    The policies he is initiating will doom us to extinction.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>Mr Livingstone, who is holding a &quot;peace party&quot; for anti-war 
    groups in City Hall tomorrow, added: &quot;I don't formally recognise George 
    Bush because he was not officially elected. So we are organising an alternative 
    reception for everybody who is not George Bush.&quot; He said he supported 
    stronger links between European Union countries only because he wanted to 
    see a powerful bloc emerge to rival the United States. &quot;The American 
    agenda is sweeping everything before it, and although it's not perfect, the 
    EU is better on environmental issues. It's a less rapacious form of capitalism.&quot; 
    </b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(IT IS ALL RAPACIOUS)</font></p>
  <p><b>...&quot;But the most important thing that affects a government is not 
    peaceful protest, but fear of the ballot box. The Mayor's comments will infuriate 
    Downing Street... Chris Lloyd, political editor of The Northern Echo: &quot;The 
    paper is Bush neutral and he has a right to visit but equally, the people 
    here have a right to demonstrate. I hope he gets to see all, or at least some 
    of those protests and I hope Mr Blair will explain what they are about because 
    that's what friends are for. Despite Mr Bush's unpopularity, there is a frisson 
    of excitement because nothing of this magnitude has ever happened there.&quot; 
    <br>
    </b></p>
  <p><b>Lucy Hovvels, vice-chairwoman of Sedgefield constituency and Labour councillor 
    in Trimdon: &quot;I've had local people asking where they can get UNION JACKS 
    AND AMERICAN FLAGS because they think it's an exciting and historic visit. 
    I really believe Bush will get a warm welcome in Trimdon and the mood is one 
    of excitement. We have the two most important people in the world coming to 
    us - no one would otherwise know where Trimdon is.&quot; </b></p>
  <p><b>Richard Wanless, co-ordinator of the 'Sedgefield Against War' protest: 
    &quot;The visit is a massive security risk and for those living in the area, 
    it jeopardises our safety. No matter where he goes, there will be protests 
    from London to the North-east to make sure he knows he is not welcome. TO 
    ME, HE IS A WAR CRIMINAL that has illegal occupation of Iraq. To add to the 
    insult, there are families here who lost their children to the war.&quot; 
    </b></p>
  <p><b>The Rev Martin King, rector of Sedgefield: &quot;A lot of people here 
    are very angry with the way the US administration is putting itself above 
    the law. One person in my congregation said if President Bush wanted to look 
    around the church, he would be welcome because it is a place for sinners, 
    but he hoped his henchmen would leave their ironware at the door. His policies 
    are very unwelcome in the region - I have not heard anyone voicing support 
    for him.&quot;</b></p>
  <p><b> Martin Callanan, Conservative MEP for Sedgefield: &quot;The visit is 
    hugely beneficial for the area. Most of the security threat to the people 
    in Sedgefield will be represented by left-wing demonstrators. And how would 
    we feel if our Prime Minister, whatever his political party, was treated similarly 
    in another part of the world? It was Blair's decision to send our troops to 
    Iraq, so those who are anti-war should not take it out on Bush.&quot; Martin 
    McTague, former chairman of the North-east Regional Federation of Small Businesses: 
    &quot;It will put Sedgefield on the map and benefit the image of the North-east. 
    Our business community is often viewed as a backwater and this will redress 
    some of the old stereotypes. Because this is Blair's constituency, a security 
    risk is always there. The fact that Bush will be with him increases that risk 
    but it is a notional increase.&quot; <br>

  <p align="center">THE FRUITS OF SAINT GEORGE</p>
  <p align="center">The Christian Right needs to take a long, hard look at George 
    W. Bush and decide &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot;<br>
    By Mick Youther</p>
  <p>May 29, 2004 - I imagined George W. Bush as the mean little kid who got his 
    kicks by pulling legs off of grasshoppers, but I was wrong. Young George preferred 
    sticking firecrackers in frogs&#146; mouths and watching them explode (NYTimes, 
    5/21/00). Put this together with a couple of DUIs, some questionable business 
    dealings and a spotty military record, and you don&#146;t exactly have the 
    resume of the leader of the free world. Fortunately for him, Bush doesn&#146;t 
    have to worry about his past indiscretions because he has been &#147;born 
    again&#148;. </p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the 
    old has gone, the new has come!&#148;-- 2 Corinthians 5:16 (NIV) </p>
  <p>Not only have his sins been forgotten, but Bush was also blessed with the 
    power to spread his Savior&#146;s message of peace and brotherhood around 
    the world. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;I've heard the call. I believe God wants me to run for president.&#148;-- 
    George W. Bush, quoted in George Magazine, September, 2000</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;God told me to strike at al Qaeda and I struck them, and then 
    He instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined 
    to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me, I will act, and if 
    not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them.&#148;-- George 
    W.Bush, in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, quoted in The Washington Post, 6/27/03 
    (Even the vengeful Right Hand of God has to keep his priorities straight)</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;[W]e will export death and violence to the four corners of the 
    earth in defense of this great country and rid the world of evil.&#148;-- 
    Bush quoted in Bob Woodward&#146;s book &#147;Bush at War&#148;, Simon &amp; 
    Schuster 2002</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;Nothing [Bush] does can be challenged on moral grounds, however 
    unethical or evil it might appear, because all of his actions are directed 
    by God. He can twist the truth, oppress the poor, exalt the rich, despoil 
    the earth, ignore the law--and murder children--without the slightest compunction, 
    the briefest moment of doubt or self-reflection, because he believes, he truly 
    believes, that God squats in his brainpan and tells him what to do.&#148;-- 
    Chris Floyd, CounterPunch, 7/30/03</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;[Bush&#146;s faith] does not give him pause or force him to 
    reflect. It is a source of comfort and strength but not of wisdom&#148;-- 
    Joe Klein, Time Magazine, 2/18/03</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;I know what I believe. I will continue to articulate what I 
    believe and what I believe -- I believe what I believe is right.&#148;-- George 
    W. Bush, describing his beliefs, 7/22/01, quoted in &quot;The Complete Bushisms&quot;</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;The drunk-gone-zealot may be reassuring to the troubled family. 
    But it is not altogether reassuring to a modern world facing such a fanatic 
    on the trigger of weapons of mass destruction that are capable of destroying 
    the Earth several times over.&#148;-- Les Payne, The Long Island, NY Newsday, 
    3/9/03</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the 
    homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism 
    or the holy name of liberty and democracy?&#148;-- Gandhi</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;The moment a person (or government or religion or organization) 
    is convinced that God is either ordering or sanctioning a cause or project, 
    anything goes. The history, worldwide, of religion-fueled hate, killing, and 
    oppression is staggering.&#148;-- Eugene Peterson, from his book &#147;THE 
    MESSAGE: New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs &#147;, Navpress 1998</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;Bush's flirtation with End Times rhetoric makes some suspect 
    that he actually perceives himself as God's instrument. Many Europeans fear 
    they're trapped between rival fundamentalist zealots whose messianic delusions 
    threaten World War III.&#148;-- Gene Lyons, Bartcop.com</p>
  <p>President Bush is already responsible for the deaths of hundreds of soldiers 
    and thousands of innocent civilians&#151;thousands more than died on 9/11. 
    Iraq is just the first in a long list of countries that need &#147;democratizing&#148;, 
    and Bush has made no secret of his willingness to use nuclear weapons in his 
    quest for peace.</p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of 
    God.&#148;-- Matthew 5:9 (NIV) </p>
  <p>&#149; &#147;By their fruits you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes 
    from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise every good tree bears good 
    fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.&#148;-- Matthew 7:16-17 (NIV) </p>
  <p>I don&#146;t see any &#147;good fruits&#148; in George W. Bush&#146;s first 
    term as President. I don&#146;t even see the much-touted &#147;growth&#148; 
    that Bush supposedly underwent after 9/11. All I see is a cruel person who 
    has progressed from blowing up frogs to blowing up people. </p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>WASHINGTON DC -- According to freelance journalist Wayne Madsden, &quot;George 
    W Bush's blood lust, his repeated commitment to Christian beliefs and his 
    constant references to 'evil doers,' in the eyes of many devout Catholic leaders, 
    bear all the hallmarks of the one warned about in the Book of Revelations--the 
    anti-Christ.&quot;</p>
  <p>Madsen, a Washington-based writer and columnist, who often writes for Counterpunch, 
    says that people close to the pope claim that amid these concerns, the pontiff 
    wishes he was younger and in better health to confront the possibility that 
    Bush may represent the person prophesized in Revelations. John Paul II has 
    always believed the world was on the precipice of the final confrontation 
    between Good and Evil as foretold in the New Testament.</p>
  <p>Before he became pope, Karol Cardinal Wojtyla said, &quot;We are now standing 
    in the face of the greatest historical confrontation humanity has gone through. 
    I do not think that wide circles of the American society or wide circles of 
    the Christian community realize this fully. We are now facing the final confrontation 
    between the church and the anti-Church, of the Gospel versus the anti-Gospel.&quot;</p>
  <p>The pope worked tirelessly to convince leaders of nations on the UN Security 
    Council to oppose Bush's war resolution on Iraq. Vatican sources claim they 
    had not seen the pope more animated and determined since he fell ill to Parkinson's 
    Disease. In the end, the pope did convince the leaders of Mexico, Chile, Cameroon 
    and Guinea to oppose the U.S. resolution.</p>
  <p>Madsen contends that &quot;Bush is a dangerous right-wing ideologue who couples 
    his political fanaticism with a neo-Christian blood cult.&quot;</p>
