<p align="center"><font size="+6">The Allegory of Holy Warfare</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p align="center"><font size="+1"> (This chapter may be used as a defense in 
    a court of law. It delineates precepts and statutes from the Sacred texts, 
    and reasons from history why one must stand <i>bold</i> in their refusal to 
    serve in the armed forces of any nation. It rehearses God's instructions to 
    Moses (Exodus 19 and 20), and reminds us that when Moses descended with the 
    Torah at Exodus 32:15, the tables were written on <i>both</i> sides. On one 
    side was the literal, written law, commanding the people of Israel to subdue 
    the land and destroy out of it every trace of <i>heathen</i> resistance (and 
    therefore a literal justification for the commission of <i>holy warfare...</i>Deuteronomy 
    7, for instance). On the other side, however, was the hidden (allegorical) 
    meanings of the Written Law. These meanings--the very essence of the Oral 
    Tradition--were handed down along a line on the Sacred Tree of Life, which 
    leads from the figure of Aaron </font>(see below)<font size="+1"> to the time 
    of John the Baptist, and subsequently into our own times. Thus this chapter 
    reiterates the teachings of Christ (the historical fulfillment, and true meaning 
    of the Higher Law). It speaks of the present judgment wars of God, and the 
    corresponding reality of God's kingdom (the <i>awakening</i>) that is also 
    unfolding in the earth. The mind of Light is now being separated from the 
    mind of Darkness. War itself is the issue that separates them, for God <i>is</i>,<i> 
    </i>indeed, a <i>God of War</i>, and a <i>Consuming Fire</i> (Exodus 15:3; 
    Deuteronomy 4:24; Hebrews 12:29...KJV). This is why the spirit of Christ came 
    into the world, to teach us, not only how to interpret the Law but how to 
    behave in a time of war; which is why we, in order to inherit the world that 
    God is creating, <i>must</i> in the end put on the garments of true pacifism 
    and become the children of Perfect Peace. <i>Wise as serpents, and harmless 
    as doves</i>. One must not be found on the battlefields of this earth in a 
    day such as this, literally killing and being killed, or serving the sons 
    of Darkness (the children of Cain) in any way whatsoever, for God is clearly 
    risen up now in the sight of all men. What does God look like? He looks like 
    the World Wars of the 20th century, and He looks like everything that is unfolding 
    in the world at this present time. God dwells in all of the powers of Heaven 
    and Earth. The cryptic words of the prophets are being fulfilled, and the 
    Great Mystic Wheel of History is about to turn. (Ezekiel 1:19-21; 10:13.)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">I</font><font size="+1">n the <i>Dead Sea Scriptures </i> (by 
  Theodor Gaster, pp.382-477), there is a section of writings entitled &quot;The 
  Triumph of God, Descriptions of the Final Age.&quot; In it is a treatise on 
  war, on the ranks and standards of warfare, on the use of the weapons of warfare 
  (seven ranks, seven spears, seven thrusts, etc.), and on the meaning of events 
  as they were to unfold in the last days (as they are presently unfolding)...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Because the Brotherhood at 
    Qumran </font>(and thus the eventual Fellowship of the Christian mysteries)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    regarded itself as the true Congregation of Israel charged with the specific 
    task of maintaining the Law and the Covenant of God in an age of apostasy 
    and confusion, of bringing men back to the True Way before the Final Judgment 
    overtook them, and of fighting the ultimate battle against the heathen, it 
    organized itself into what may be fairly described as a 'church.' Such an 
    organization requires a formal set of principles and and a constitution, and 
    these were (first) set forth in the two documents known as the The Manual 
    of Discipline and the Zadokite Document.&quot; </font>Introduction, p.37<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But 
    even if the Torah be correctly expounded by a prophet and teacher, men, it 
    is held, can and will receive it only if they be correctly attuned. And that 
    attunement comes...through 'inner enlightenment.' The community considers 
    itself, therefore, not only the remnant of Israel but also the specially 'enlightened.'...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be a mistake to suppose 
    that the writers of the Scrolls and the men of Qumran were inspired only by 
    recollection of things past or that they chose their way of life simply because 
    they were unsettled by political turbulence or disgusted by the venality of 
    the Jerusalemitan priests. They were also swept by other winds. One of these 
    was the widespread and well-attested contemporary belief that the great cycle 
    of the ages was about to complete its revolution. This belief was based on 
    a conception, which can in fact be traced to remote Indian antiquity, that 
    existence consists not in linear progressive development--that is, in history--but 
    in a constant repetition of primordial and archetypal events. </font>(It is, 
    in fact, <a href="../UsedImages/pg3azodiac2.gif">both</a>)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
    When major upheavals occurred, it was promptly supposed that the cycle was 
    nearing its end, that the Great Year was at hand, and that cosmos was about 
    to revert to chaos. The primal elements, restrained and regulated at the beginning 
    of the world, would again be unleashed; all things would dissolve in an overwhelming 
    deluge or be burned in the everlasting fire which rages in the depths of the 
    earth. Then the cycle would begin again; a new world would be <a href="SideLinks/TheHolyChild.htm">brought 
    to birth</a>.&quot; </font>The Dead Sea Scriptures, pp.7,8<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">__________</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now the interpretation of 
    the Sacred Scriptures is based on the under-meaning in the allegorical narratives; 
    for these men look upon the whole of their law-code as being like a living 
    thing, having for A Body the spoken commands, and for a soul the unseen thoughts 
    stored up in the words (in which the rational soul of the student begins to 
    contemplate things native to their own nature)--the interpretation, as it 
    were, in the mirror of the words and names, catching sight of the extraordinary 
    beauties of the ideas contained in them, unwrapping and unrobing the symbols 
    from them, and bringing to light the naked inner meaning, for those who are 
    able with a little suggestion to arrive at by intuition the hidden sense from 
    the outer meaning.&quot; </font>Philo, On The Contemplative Life<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Thus the mind familiar with the literary techniques of the 
  ancient world--(the Torah possessing an outer and inner meaning for example...Exodus 
  32:15), and with the direct connections that existed between the world-view 
  of the Qumran Community and the early Church, with the history of the Church 
  itself, and finally with the oracles of God as they are making themselves known 
  to us in our time--cannot fail to see the purely allegorical nature of these 
  accounts. They employ the imagery of actual warfare--particularly of the standards 
  of combat as it was being waged between the Romans and the Celto-Germanic tribes 
  of that time--in order to summon up the spirit of the Church, to encourage it 
  to rise up in the context of that imagery to the great task that lay before 
  it: the literal conquest of the whole lower order of reality. The battle would 
  be epic in scope and culminate, not simply in overcoming the illusions and delusions 
  of the natural world, but in the overcoming of the Self (the Dragon within...please 
  understand Chapter 3), for this is the whole meaning and the essential aim of 
  spiritual warfare. And not only the individual Self but the Collective Self--the 
  mind of the Nation-church with all of its collective propensities for wrong-thinking 
  and wrong-doing. For both the individual and the Nation must be purified and 
  made whole before they can perform right-service to the world on behalf of God.

  walls of ancient Egypt; and finally carried back to Eden (to America) on the 
  wings of the Hebrew state of mind--had to be brought to all of its historical 
  conclusions. All things had to be brought together, not only in time and space 
  but in the mind of <i>man</i>. The Great Circle had to be connected to itself. 
  Both the mind of Light and the mind of Darkness had to be brought to their mutual 
  states of perfection.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The epic story of the <i>Mahabrata </i>and<i> The Bhagavad

  battle, fought upon the holy field of Kuruksetra. The field (regardless of those 
  Vedic literalists who teach otherwise, who rationalize to those of lesser understanding 
  their duty to wage war, to partake in the actual killing of other human beings 
  in the service of God), is the whole world, and the ultimate battle unfolds 
  in the heart, the mind and the soul of every spiritual aspirant (Hindu, Jew, 
  Christian and Muslim alike)...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These are the chakras of 
    the Tree of Life, and, along with the other corresponding systems of tantric 
    thought, they are related to the Seven primary levels of human consciousness. 
    They govern the senses, and are channels into and out of this realm, and connect 
    the central points of interaction that exist between the individual soul, 
    the outside world, and the presence of God who inhabits all. The soul's task, 
    once it has entered into the mystery of Life (its own body, which is the only 
    &quot;land&quot; the individual soul is ever permitted to rule over with authority), 
    is to explore the darkness, to go down into the empire of its own existence,

    up these channels (the pathways to the sefirot), bringing the whole of one's 
    being to the light, and into the service of higher reality. When the lowest 
    sefira is subdued--brought under subjection, illuminated--the whole body is 
    full of light, and the mystical union between the Mind of God, and the mind 
    of the individual soul is completed. (Or rather can be completed with the 
    proper alignment of concepts and the right revelations.) The soul's descent 
    into the lowest parts of its own existence is directly analogous in the interior 
    world to the Holy Nation's descent on the historical plane to the lowest, 
    most Western parts of the earth, as it is written: <i>...that they might be 
    called Trees of Righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He and She might 
    be glorified.</i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.. (Isaiah 
    61:3). It is to fulfill the words, 'as above so below', 'On earth as it is 
    in heaven.'&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Assembled on this field at this very moment in time are all 
  the forces of Creation. All of history is assembled here--the powers of Light 
  and the powers of Darkness. Centered between them is the figure of Arjuna who 
  represents the spiritual mind coming to perfection. In the Bhagavad Gita we 
  learn that he is reluctant to enter the battle, because his affections lay on 
  both sides. Though injustice rules he does not want to see anyone destroyed 
  (even though there is death and destruction already everywhere around him). 
  His (Their's) is the mind struggling with right-reason and right-aspiration--a 
  mind still connected to its own closest circumstances. He is not a <i>friend 
  of the world</i> (he sees the Dark-hearted ones, the antichrists of the earth, 
  for who they are), but a lover of <i>Life</i>, and of<i> </i> tranquility. He 
  is, by reason of his own earthly struggles, a child of humanity, a son of man. 
  He is also by reason of his own thoughts and prayers a child of God, and is 
  working out the relationship and the balance between the two (thus his conversation 
  with Lord Sri Krishna). He cannot bear the estrangement of his own friends and 
  relatives who he sees are assembled on the other side, or the breakup of all 
  the relationships that he knows will occur once the battle begins. He cannot 
  bear the possibility of those he loves choosing the wrong side in the day of 
  Decision (even though he plainly sees that their spiritual minds are being destroyed 
  anyway through the relentless attacks of the forces of Darkness to which they 
  are subject). He will not fight because he is in conflict; because he himself 
  has experienced the vicissitudes of life. He himself has partaken of the Darkness, 
  and understands its hold on the human heart and mind. He would rather, if he 
  could, just bear the results of it all in his own heart. But Lord Sri Krishna, 
  the 8th manifestation <a href="SideLinks/Vishnu.htm">of Vishnu</a>, Arjuna's 
  own charioteer (the true guiding principle and the focus of his own inward thoughts), 
  expounds as one friend to another the sublime mysteries of the human soul and 
  its place in the center of God's Universe, in the center of time itself, and 
  the purpose of this great battle in the higher, historical scheme of things. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">(We may immediately see in the relationship between the two 
  cousins, Arjuna and Krishna, the figures of John the Baptist in his relationship 
  to the Angel of Divine Presence (the Universal Christ), who was appearing to 
  Arjuna (the mind of John) in His terrible Four-handed form, and then in His 
  wholly non-violent Two-handed form. See <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>, chapter 11). Arjuna 
  (John) has been selected for this role because of his distaste for it. The affairs 
  of judgment are never entrusted to those who revel in judgment, and who delight 
  in the idea of vengeance and retribution. But rather they are entrusted to those 
  who--because of the nature of their association with, and love for the mystery 
  of Life itself--plead instead for the souls of those upon whom the laws of Karmic 
  justice are about to take effect. (When the Baptist said, <i>Now is the axe 
  laid to the root of the tree...</i>he meant the tree of his own sinful nature 
  as well). Arjuna's (John's) is the mind centered at that place where the Universal 
  Mind of Christ and the mind of humanity meet. The spiritual aspirant expresses 
  the struggles of being human to God, and in turn the reasonings of God to humanity. 
  Some years after John was imprisoned for his prophetic witness Paul will write:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Therefore if anyone be in Christ, they are a new creature: 
    old things are passed away; all things become new.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to Themself 
    by Jesus Christ </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(the 
    composite form of the Druid Hesus and the Vedic Crishna)<i></i></font><i><font size="+1">, 
    and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation:</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">To wit, that God was in Christ </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(as 
    Brahma appeared in the navel of Vishnu)<i></i></font><font size="+1"><i> reconciling 
    the world unto Themself, not imputing their trespass unto them; and hath committed 
    unto us the word of reconciliation.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech 
    you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">For God hath made him to be sin for us, </font></i><font size="+1"><i>who 
    knew no sin</i></font><i><font size="+1">; that we may be made the righteousness 
    of God in him...</font></i><font size="+1">(2 Corinthians 5:17-21; Deuteronomy 
    21:22,23).).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">How, of course, could the Universal Christ become sin for us 
  except in us? And where it says, <i>And knew no sin</i>, it does not mean that 
  the Christ-in-us (the Krishna in Arjuna) has not experienced those things in 
  life that we readily associate with sin. It simply means that our common life 
  in Christ (as we each come to the realization of it) is always governed by the 
  words:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin 
    is covered.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, 
    and in whose spirit there is no guile...</font></i><font size="+1">(Psalm 
    32:1,2).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">It is in the light of these very same words that Peter also 
  writes: <i>For even hereunto were you called: because Christ suffered for us, 
  leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: WHO DID NO SIN, NEITHER 
  WAS GUILE FOUND IN HIS MOUTH</i>. (1 Peter 2:21,22). Many must still share in 
  this <i>suffering</i> as it is, for their refusal to partake in war or in any 
  other way the lives of other human beings. The Christ Mystery is not complete 
  yet... </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The whole point here is that there are many in the antiwar 
  movement who, for their own <i>progressive</i> reasons, have skipped this phase 
  of the battle, who are not concerned with inner transformation, or with the 
  language of transformation (with sacred texts, or the relationship between man 
  and God). They want to tear a system down (and rightly so), but have no idea 
  about what to set up in its place...what could it be but another humanistic 
  order? There will be great discussions about it as the smoke is clearing but 
  the Law of God (in what ever creative form it assumes), will still hold. (And 
  neither is this a call to some new form of fundamentalism. Have you come to 
  the Center? Look around, these are the souls that God has chosen to inherit 
  the coming age. It is a Rainbow of individuals, races, religions, issues and 
  concerns, all of which will be addressed around the council fires of the coming 
  age, in love, as the Law begins to issue forth from Zion). Peter is speaking 
  of every soul who has ever been set free by God to work out their own salvation 
  (free to descend to the Dragon's den); God knowing that they would in the end 
  bring themselves back up as victorious warriors (many of them as whole burnt 
  offerings and willing sacrifices). Thus the personal charges and moral accusations 
  that shall be weighed against the children of Light in our time. It is in this 
  same light that we understand Paul's own struggles--with his own lower self--and 
  learn the meaning of his words in Romans 6:12-18, and the whole of chapter 8 
  (KJV)..</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> And it is in this epic light that Arjuna comes to understand 
  the purpose of <i>battle</i> itself, and why it must at last be fought beyond 
  the personal level, on the political field and in glaring light of day, so that 
  the cause of true understanding can be advanced in the world. As in the Torah, 
  this story in Bhagavadgita must not be construed as a literal war, against the 
  mortal lives of other human beings (although the epics have always been written 
  against the backdrop of actual warfare--of those wars which have been waged 
  by warring classes in the earth from the beginning of human history until now), 
  but a spiritual war waged against the individual, as well as<i> </i>collective 
  lower <i>self</i>, against the natural thought-forms and ideas that lead to 
  war, and against the lower physical and mental impulses that governed not merely 
  his own life but the lives of those around him. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the most present sense his, or rather our's, was not only 
  a battle against the continuing idea of human warfare (a battle that is now 
  being waged by millions in the earth), but with an understanding of God's Presence 
  in all of these affairs. The idea that God is the cosmic protagonist, the initiator 
  of war in the earth, is a concept which few, even now, could fully understand--despite 
  everything the Scriptures had to say about it all. But then, who even cares 
  about the scriptures except those who were perverting them? (The world was moving 
  toward a <i>post-scriptural </i> age). Thus the struggle becomes two-sided, 
  against the Right who believe God is on their side, and the Left who have little 
  time for the study of sacred texts. (It is always lonely out there in the <i>center</i>). 
  It is a struggle in itself to try to articulate (as an activist and not simply 
  as an academic or a theologian), the ultimate story in the Scriptures, the meaning 
  of the great Universal Nonviolent Yajna--the Sacrifice that is central to both 
  the Vedas and the Gospels. Nevertheless, having clarified these ideas in his 
  own mind, and with renewed resolve he enters back into the flow of action and 
  fulfills his calling:</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The eternal God is unlimited, 
    and since His activities are also unlimited, He has unlimited names, of which 
    Krsna is one. Why then is Arjuna addressing him as Madhusadana (the destroyer 
    of the demon Madhu) when, being Krsna's friend, he could address him directly 
    as Krsna? The answer is that Arjuna considers his mind to be like a great 
    demon, such as the demon Madhu. If it were possible for Krsna to kill the 
    demon called the mind, then Arjuna would be able to attain the perfection 
    of yoga. (Union with the Divine)...Arjuna is saying. &quot;Please, if you 
    could kill him, then it would be possible for me to execute this yoga system.&quot; 
    Even the mind of one such as Arjuna is always agitated. As Arjuna himself 
    says:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>&quot;For the mind is restless, 
      turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Krsna, and to subdue it is, it seems 
      to me, more difficult than controlling the wind.&quot;</i> (Bg. 6.34).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is indeed a fact that the mind 
    is always telling us to go here, go there, do this, do that--it is always 
    telling us which way to turn. Thus the sum and substance of the yoga system 
    is to control the agitated mind. In the meditational yoga system the mind 
    is controlled by focusing on the Supersoul (the Lord of All Being)--that is 
    the whole purpose of yoga. But Arjuna says that controlling this mind is more 
    difficult than stopping the wind from blowing...Are we to assume that Arjuna 
    is simply not sufficiently qualified to control his mind? The actual fact 
    is that we cannot begin to understand the immense qualifications of Arjuna. 
    After all, he was a personal friend of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.&quot;

<p><font size="+1">(Prabhupada's disciples, incidently, have taught that if one

  This belief is based not so much on a rejection, but in an inability to attain 
  to the teachings of the Highest Yoga Tantra as revealed in the West by the Christ-spirit 
  Itself. It is ultimately a perversion of the idea of non-duality, wherein the 
  One God who is Absolutely Non-Dualistic, from whom both good and evil flow, 
  commanded the world through Abraham and Moses (as the world moved from a Vedic 
  into a Hebrew state of mind), to <i>choose the good</i>. Thus it leaves those 
  who are ignorant of the higher law in a mental state of duality (Look into India 
  and see the results). . Of the Three Vedic pathways the two lower pathways lead 
  back into the cycle of birth and death. Those who literally take up arms, because 
  it is their <i>duty</i>, follow this path. Only the highest path leads out of

<p><font size="+1">...before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the <i>Jihad</i> 
  that was about enflame the world. It was sent to a young man named Michael who 
  enlisted in the Armed Forces of the United States in the mid 1980s. His parents 
  are sincere fundamentalists, and have been led to believe that it is a Christian's 
  duty <i>to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.</i> It is about 
  war, and about God who is <i>a God of War</i>. It is about the times we live 
  in, and about the mystery of LIFE. For God is LIFE. Life is powerful. Death 
  cannot kill Life, but Life can kill Death. God is Alive. The Word of God is 
  Alive...but we are practically dead. It is as the Word says: <i>The Letter killeth.&quot; 
  </i> Literalism, a scourge upon man, has three effects on the life of the people: 
  . It <i>obscures</i> the past, it <i>perplexes</i> the present, and it <i>beclouds</i> 
  the future. Michael's church teaches him to interpret the Scriptures literally, 
  and to walk in the precepts of the literal word. (Which is, of course, impossible 
  without resorting to fanaticism and violent extremism on the one hand--or a 
  resigned disregard for what the Scriptures actually have to say on the other, 
  and a general state of ignorance about their meanings in between). In which 
  case, however, we must all begin to fall down before graven images, because 
  the Scripture tells us that Christ is <i>a Stone, and the Rock that followed 
  us.</i> Michael's church would then say that we are permitted here to discern 
  between the truth and the symbol. We agree. The word <i>God</i> is a symbol 
  for Life. Life is the Face of God. Whatever Life is doing God is doing. And 
  God, at this moment in time, is preparing to bring a judgment war against all 
  the children of Abraham in the world because of their warring ways--because 
  of both their extremism and their utter disregard for the meaning of the Word 
  itself:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Dear Michael,</p>
  <p>Forget that this letter is coming from me (an old hippy living up the hollow). 
    Pretend instead that it is from a respected elder, or from some famous television 
    evangelist; and that they, with all of their credentials and notoriety, asked 
    you: &quot;Just where in the Holy Scriptures, Michael, do you find permission, 
    or a commandment, to enlist in the Armed Forces of the United States (or any 
    other nation for that matter)? Because we heard from those who love you that 
    this is your intention we felt compelled to search the Scriptures for you. 
    And because the Scriptures are of little value to us if they are not able 
    to transfigure themselves, or project their meanings into the world as we 
    know it, we have searched the events of our times as well. (see Acts 2:17-21). 
    And as a result we are compelled to tell you that the only call to arms that 
    we can find, that involves actual human combat, is the one God is issuing 
    through the prophet Joel where He summons all the sons of Darkness to come 
    up to meet Him (which means each other) in battle. But Michael, it is to plead 
    with them, and then finally to put an end to them if they will not relent. 
    So we plead with you and your family, search the Scriptures again, but with 
    a mind that is coming to a full age. Then look it into the world around you 
    to see how it is obeying the very dictates of God which say:</p>
  <p><i>Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles: Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, 
    let all the men of war draw near, let them come up:</i></p>
  <p><i>Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; 
    let the weak say, I am strong.</i></p>
  <p><i>Assemble yourselves, and come all ye heathen, and gather yourselves round 
    about: thither cause thy Mighty Ones to come down, O Lord.</i></p>
  <p><i>Let the heathen be awakened, and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, 
    </i>(understand the meaning of 2 Chronicles 20:15-20)<i>: for there will I 
    sit to judge all the heathen round about...</i>(Joel 3:9-12).<font size="+1"> 
    </font></p>
  <p>And because you are no <i>Gentile</i>, Michael, but rather a child of the 
    great Commonwealth of those who seek the Face of God, and of those who are 
    being given access to the meanings of God's word in our time, we must arrive 
    together at the conclusion that in order to obey the most excellent commandments 
    of God, which come from above, we must disobey, or rather resist, His other 
    commandments which emanate into our thoughts from below--those commandments 
    that seem to give us permission, or a directive to obey the powers of the 
    earth, and especially in this case where it comes to the most serious subject 
    of killing and warfare; because these are the singular issues that separate 
    the mind of Light from the mind of Darkness in the last day:</p>
  <p><i>Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, 
    and had polluted my sabbaths </i>(my higher meanings, all of which are liberating 
    to the soul)<i>, and their eyes were after their father's idols.</i></p>
  <p><i>Wherefore I gave them </i>(literal)<i> statutes that were not good, and 
    judgments whereby </i>(if they literally walk them)<i> they should not live;</i></p>
  <p><i>And I polluted them in their gifts, in that they caused to pass through 
    the Fire </i>(of Warfare)<i> all that openeth the womb, that I </i>(the Terrible

  <p>We must resist what Paul called <i>His strong delusions</i>, (2 Thessalonians 
    2:11), and what Isaiah called <i>The spirit of deep sleep</i> which God has 
    cast upon us because of our transgressions. (Isaiah 29:10-16). How do we resist? 
    Through the awakened Spirit of Christ-in-us. For all things are revealed to 
    Christ. And then, with this mind of Christ, we ask: Who are these Mighty Ones 
    that the prophet Joel speaks of?...</p>
  <p>Some American evangelists wrote (before the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
    and some of them still hold to it), that Jesus was going to suddenly appear 
    out of the sky with a great host to destroy the Soviet army, along with all 
    of the other &quot;unchristian&quot; powers of the East. We do not know what 
    they do with the words that say: <i>It is He who founded His Troop </i>IN<i> 
    the earth. </i>(Amos 9:6), and <i>Lift up your eyes on high and behold who 
    created these things, that bringeth out their host by number. </i>(Isaiah 
    40:26). We must suppose that these ministers of God's word imagine that these 
    troops, and this heavenly host, must be the American armies and their <a href="../UsedImages/nato.gif">NATO 
    allies</a>, and perhaps even the American church that supports them. We, however--because 
    we have considered all the signs of these times in light of the Word of God, 
    and because of the words which say...</p>
  <p><i>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. FOR THERE IS NO POWER 
    BUT OF GOD: THE POWERS THAT BE ARE ORDAINED OF GOD.</i></p>
  <p><i>Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the ordinance of God: 
    and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation...</i>(Romans 13:1-7).</p>
  <p>--say in return that these Mighty Ones are not some ethereal beings who shall 
    appear out of heaven to destroy the Communist armies, but are none other than 
    those Communist armies themselves as the prophet Joel declares:</p>
  <p><i>Cast in THE SICKLE, for the harvest of the earth is ripe, come get ye 
    down; for the press is full, the fats overflow: for their wickedness is great...</i></p>

  <p><i>Multitudes, multitudes in the Valley of Decision, for the Day of the Lord 
    is near in the Valley of Decision...</i>(Joel 3:13,14). </p>
  <p>Joel speaks of <i>the Valley of Decision</i>. This is that narrow place that 
    runs through the events of our times and between the two great mountains we 
    know as the United States and the Soviet Union (now Russia) (and, of course, 
    do not fail to consider those who are <i>higher still</i>--China and its millions 
    of warriors poised at God's command). The City of David was hidden in the 
    center between them. The words are a spiritual metaphor suggestive of the 
    great struggle that is presently unfolding in the world between the forces 
    of Light and Darkness. Joel also refers to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. Where 
    is it? It is not anywhere. It is a state of mind, a place of understanding:</p>

  <p><i>Hearken ye, all Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, thus saith the Lord 
    unto you, be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude, FOR 
    THE BATTLE IS NOT YOUR'S BUT GOD'S.</i></p>
  <p><i>Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, 
    and see the Salvation of the Lord with you. O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, 
    nor be dismayed. Tomorrow </i>(after we have all been instructed in the ways 
    of holy warfare) <i>go out after them, for the Lord will be with you...</i>(2 
    Chronicles 20:15, 17).</p>
  <p>And because this battle between the nations of the earth is the Lord's, Joel 
    says of those who can be none other than the powers of the East themselves:</p>
  <p><i>And the Lord shall utter His Voice before His army: for His camp is very 
    great: For strong is He that executeth His word: for the day of the Lord is 
    great and very terrible and who can abide it?...</i>(Joel 2:11).</p>
  <p>The Scriptures also say: <i>I will also choose their delusions...</i>(Isaiah 
    66:4). Thus America and its Western allies are presently laboring under the 
    delusion that Russia and China are in their political and military camp. But 
    the more accurate reality suggests itself in the words: </p>
  <p><i>Are they all not ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them 
    who shall be heirs of salvation...</i>(Hebrews 1:14).</p>
  <p>Every soul shall reveal what spirit is in them in the Day of the Lord--<i>In 
    the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according 
    to (Paul's) Gospel.</i> (Romans 2:16). Those who have it in their hearts to 
    kill and to make war in the name of God (whether Christian or Jew, Hindu or 
    Muslim),will be found killing, and making war. It makes no difference whether 
    this killing happens in the streets of American cities, or the Middle East, 
    in Kashmir, Chechnya, or on any other battlefield in the world, whether by 
    those considered to be criminals against the existing order of things, or 
    by the police and the armed forces in defense of it. On the universal scale 
    killing is killing. It is all murder. If it is done in the name of God (and 
    more particularly, in the name of Christ) it is the work of Darkness. As long 
    as there is killing in the name of God in the world then the Lord of Darkness 
    will continue to kill. It is as simple as this: In order to end crime, end 
    crime. In order to stop the killing, stop the killing. To end war, end war.

  <p>Millions have brought their children to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania over the 
    years (one of the American nation's most sacred places), to recount the events 
    of those fateful days in July of 1863. They begin their tour at McPherson's 
    Ridge where the first shots were exchanged between advancing Confederate troops 
    and Union cavalry positioned at the entryway to the town in front of them. 
    They point to the statue of Union general John Reynolds who fell slain at 
    that point. AND THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND. They pass under the procession of 
    tall trees and view the cannon lining Seminary Ridge where thousands of Southern 
    soldiers were assembled, waiting the command for their turn to be ripped apart 
    and killed two days later in the event called Pickett's Charge. AND THEY DO 
    NOT UNDERSTAND. They proceed to the Peach Orchard and the Wheatfield, Devils' 
    Den and Little Round Top, names etched into the national consciousness, where 
    thousands of dead and wounded littered the ground the second day--their blood 
    soaking the earth, their souls draining away. AND THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND. 
    They arrive at Cemetery Ridge where the Federal line held. It repulsed on 
    the third day the hellish charge of 15,000 Rebels who were ordered straight-on 
    across an open field into an unmerciful barrage of cannon fire, metal shot, 
    rifle fire and bayonets, before the whole assault was reduced to a fist fight 
    (a gang fight) over an old stone wall and a wooden fence. AND THEY DO NOT 
    UNDERSTAND... </p>
  <p>One can sit there on the battlefield and still see them, still hear them; 
    one can see them dragging themselves and their fallen comrades back to their 
    own lines, over the remains of thousands of other wasted lives, to a crescendo 
    of voices from the other side shouting &quot;Fredricksburg! Fredricksburg! 
    Fredricksburg!&quot; That is where the Union soldiers were sacrificed in the 
    same way not many weeks beforehand. For those who worship at the altars of 
    Ba'al (the <a href="SideLinks/TheNationCult.htm">god of the American Nation</a>) 
    this pilgrimage is a fully religious experience. BUT THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND. 
    Those who led these these young men away from their homes and families were 
    MAD. (See Isaiah 1:4-8). They were possessed by the demons of their own natural 
    minds. They were moved, as are all natural men in the earth, by a spirit of 
    vainglory, by the fires of deception that burn in the lower nature of the 
    soul--the fires of &quot;righteous&quot; violence, of &quot;righteous&quot; 
    vengeance and &quot;righteous&quot; destruction. Each side was fighting for 
    a diabolical cause: one to affirm the idea of &quot;state's rights,&quot; 
    national determination as it is--the sin of Self-will--and for the right to 
    exercise power, as they saw fit, over the lives of other human beings. (We 
    need not try to rehearse everything that has already been written about the 
    institution of slavery in America). And the other to preserve a union, a political 
    order, that stood wholly in violation of the precepts and the teachings of 
    Christ to begin with. Of course the American nation <i>was</i> called into 
    existence by God, such is the paradox of history, but we were commanded to 
    have no part in it. (Open the pages of the Book of Isaiah. Read the epistles 
    of Peter with a historically-discerning mind). And this so that the world 
    could witness what spiritual rebellion looks like, and how it comes at last 
    to its own end. (See Matthew 7:21-27)...</p>

  <p><i>And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the Lord; Thus saith

  <p>They did not understand then, and we do not understand now. When parents 
    hand their children over to the political and military leaders of a country 
    they are giving them over to self-serving men who have absolutely no idea 
    what is happening in the world at that moment, or how the battle or history 
    is about to turn, but who will still sacrifice every last soldier in their 
    command to their own misguided, &quot;demonic,&quot; sense of reality. Where 
    are the souls of those who fought for the South? What did they fight for? 
    What did they die for? Despite all of Lee's invocations, despite his certainty 
    that God was &quot;on his side,&quot; God was not. Robert E. Lee was not just 
    a vaingloriously proud man, he was spiritually MAD, as are all the present 
    rulers of the Western world. And Lee actually invoked God, fervently. Think 
    of those leaders of the American political and military establishments in 
    our time who are doing the same.</p>
  <p><i>Yea, they sacrifice their sons and daughters unto devils. And shed innocent

  <p><i>But I say,, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice

  <p>Do those who kill and make war, and those who respond to the challenges of 
    war, have a choice in the matter? No. because all things have been preordained. 
    And then yes, because this is an appointed time of Release. All of us, in 
    the great economy of God's creative will, have been appointed a role in the 
    final drama of human redemption, just as every preceding generation was appointed 
    their's. In the mix both the spirit of Light and the spirit of Darkness have 
    been coming to perfection in the earth, and now each of us--according to the 
    final alignment and character of our own thoughts--are given the opportunity 
    to choose between them. <i>Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of Decision, 
    </i>Joel says. <i>Choose Life that you and your seed may live, </i>Moses says. 
    <i>Come unto me</i>, Christ says. </p>
  <p>The spirit of Darkness in us, steeped in the illusions of the lower world 
    as it is, wants to align itself with the logic of this world, and thus with 
    those who are presently in charge of the world and who, of course, want to 
    stay in charge of it. The spirit of Darkness in us is that which keeps us 
    from realizing that it is God Himself who is rising up against them. It keeps 
    us from seeing that it is God who is responsible, not simply for all of the 
    good in the world, but for the &quot;evil&quot; as well--that it is God Himself 
    who is hiding in the Darkness of human affairs, bringing all things to completion 
    after the council of Their own will. (It will also benefit us to stop arguing 
    over how many God is, whether God is One, Two, Three, or a Thousand. God is 
    ALL, and They are ONE as it is written: <i>Let US create man in our own image...</i>Genesis 
    1:26. The perfected mind worships the ONE as it is written: <i>Hear O Israel, 
    the Lord our God </i>(who is many) <i>is ONE.</i>)...</p>
  <p><i>Oh that we were wise, that they understood this, (that we understood this, 
    that we had considered our latter end)...</i></p>
  <p><i>See now that I, even I, am He, </i>(I am They)<i>, and there is no God 
    with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any 
    that can deliver out of My Hand...</i>(Deuteronomy 32:29-47).</p>

  <p><i>That they may know from the rising of the Sun, and from the West, that

    there is none else.</i></p>
  <p><i>I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace and create evil: I 
    the Lord do all these things...</i>(Isaiah 45:6,7).</p>
  <p>If this were not so there would be two Gods, or more, and we would not know 
    who to serve, or whose forces to enlist in. But when there is ONE God who 
    created both good and evil and who commands us to choose the good, we can 
    choose without fear.</p>
  <p>What purpose has God served by these historic means, and exactly how do we 
    escape as a people from a fate that would otherwise be our's if God had not 
    also purposed to rise up in all of these events to deliver us? The second 
    part of the question is its own answer. Where the Scripture says: <i>But he 
    who shall endure to the end the same shall be saved,</i> (Matthew 24:13), 
    it means: <i>Those who have waited upon Messiah</i>--or rather, the Messiahs. 
    These will be discovered as the events of our time unfold, at the <a href="../UsedImages/hanukkah.gif">the 
    Eighth emanation</a> on the World Tree, at the place named Majesty, as it 
    is also written:</p>
  <p><i>He will keep the Feet of His saints, and the wicked shall be silent in 
    darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</i></p>
  <p><i>The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken in pieces; out of heaven shall 
    He Thunder upon them, </i>(He is Thor)<i>, the Lord shall judge the ends of 
    the earth; and He shall give strength unto His king, </i>(D.V.D.)<i>, and 
    exalt the horn of His anointed...</i>1 Samuel 2:9,10; (Zechariah 4; Romans 
    10:1-4).</p>
  <p>These words refer also to all of those who are presently in the armed forces, 
    but who will lay down their arms and defect to the Messiahs as they understand 
    the words: <i>And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw: and behold, the 
    mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about...Wherefore they 
    arose and fled in the twilight...to the Jordan, leaving all their garments 
    and instruments of war behind them. </i>(2 Kings 6:15--17; 7:5-7, 15)...</p>
  <p>Which is why, Michael, you must destroy out of your heart any notion that 
    you have a duty to kill America's enemies, because America's enemy is God. 
    Why should God be against America? For the very same reason He destroyed every 
    other empire through which the people have sojourned, and which have also 
    held His oracles captive. Who is captive? Everyone who has been led to believe 
    that obedience to one's tribal or national ethos, whether they be Christian 
    or Jew, Muslim or Hindu, is obedience to God, is captive to that ethos...</p>
  <p><i>For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and His fury upon 
    ALL their armies...</i>(Isaiah 34:1,2).</p>
  <p><i>Behold, the nations are as a drop in the bucket...ALL nations before Him 
    are as nothing...</i>(Isaiah 40:15-17).</p>
  <p>And everyone is captive who cannot understand the allegorical and epic nature 
    of the Holy Scriptures, who insist, for instance, that when John the Baptist 
    did not censure the &quot;soldiers&quot; who came to him, for being soldiers, 
    (Luke 3:14), he was presaging the &quot;just war&quot; theory that emerged 
    in later centuries as the church aligned itself with the causes of the nations--everyone 
    against the other. This doctrine can be attributed to Augustine, who appears 
    in the life of Christendom several decades after the <i>church</i> (not the 
    true Church of course) was already entangled in the intrigues of the Roman 
    empire at the time of Constantine. By the time of Constantine and his dark 
    deeds, however, the true interpreters of the Gospels were already being banished 
    from the life of the organized church. Driven out like so many wayward Druids, 
    many of them back into the stream of Judaism, these gnostics took with them 
    into the spiritual underground the epic meanings of God's words which said: 
    <i>But Pharaoh</i>, (the spirit of the World-ruler)<i>, shall not hearken 
    unto you, that I may lay My Hand upon Egypt, AND BRING FORTH MINE ARMIES, 
    AND MY PEOPLE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL out of the land of Egypt with great judgments. 
    </i>(Exodus 7:4). All of these knew that Egypt is a symbol for the whole world, 
    and that those <i>soldiers</i> who came to him were not enlisted in the cause 
    of Rome or any other nation, but in the great secret cause of God who began 
    to bring to pass then what shall finally be fulfilled now. These <i>soldiers</i> 
    were serving in the army of Christ, as it is written:</p>
  <p><i>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</i></p>
  <p><i>No man who warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that 
    he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier...</i>(2 Timothy 2:3,4).</p>
  <p>Michael, we cannot sit at two tables, drink from two cups, or swing two swords....(PS) 
    And now that you are safely out of the service it still holds true: <i>We 
    cannot serve two masters. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">When God commanded the children of Israel to make war against, 
  and to utterly slay their enemies (Deut.2:34; 7:1-6), He also told Moses to 
  instruct the people in the secret meanings of these commandments. Why are there 
  secret meanings? So that God could separate those who are being led by the Spirit 
  from those who are being led by their own natural lights in the last days. (John 
  3:19-21). So Moses instructed the people: &quot;I am writing in this law of 
  stone that you shall slay your enemies, but I am telling you face to face what 
  these things mean--just as the Holy Spirit of Divine Wisdom shall instruct your 
  children in the times to come. Your enemies are not, in any literal sense, the 
  other peoples of the world, for the Holy One resides everywhere in creation, 
  in all peoples, and, therefore, how can you literally fight against them without 
  fighting against God? And how can you possibly redeem those you are literally 
  killing, or who you have eventually come to &quot;hate?&quot; Your enemy is 
  not these peoples, but their ways, their fallen notions of reality. The great 
  difference that shall now exist between you and them is that while you shall 
  be able to perceive God's Presence everywhere, they, until they are converted 
  to this law, and to these precepts, shall see God nowhere, not even in themselves. 
  You are a called-out nation of servants who shall bear the Oracles of God across 
  the pages of history until the times are full, and until the Terrible Presence 
  of God is risen up everywhere in the world. (See Exodus 34 and Deuteronomy 7; 
  De.12:30-32)...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">You shall go over the higher Jordan (see Joshua 3 to 5), which 
  runs through time and to the ends of the earth, whose waters shall divide your 
  perceptions of the world from the world itself. (See Joshua 1:7-11; Josh.23). 
  And you will, when you continue in the higher precepts of this Law, become the 
  redemption of the nations; but when you fail to observe and keep them, a curse, 
  because the nations shall then have no place or philosophy of refuge. Your enemies 
  are not the peoples of the world, but their fallen ways, their philosophies, 
  their interpretations of reality, and their practices. These you must destroy, 
  but from your own hearts first (for up to now these have been your own ways 
  as well), and only after that will you be effectively able to join in the effort 
  of destroying these things from the thinking of these nations. It shall be <i>An 
  eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, stripe for stripe</i>--the mind of 
  Light against the mind of Darkness--the Great Body of Knowledge (which shall 
  be yourselves, and which shall fill the earth), against the Great Spirit of 
  Ignorance of Things Divine that shall accompany it. (Open the Book of Jude) 
  And how shall you gain the victory? By emulating the ways of Darkness? through 
  killing, and death and destruction? NO! NEVER! For these are the ways of Cain. 
  These are the ways of <i>Nimrod</i> in the earth. And when these shall rise 
  up like a great Beast in the last days, God shall rise up in all the other Powers 
  of the earth to destroy them. But through service, through study and instruction, 
  through resistance, through long-suffering and sacrifice, through those virtues 
  that endure when others fail--through Love. And so that you, who are the figures 
  of those who shall be released from spiritual and intellectual bondage at the 
  end of the age, and so that your children do not forget that it is a Greater 
  Holy War that we are waging, it shall be plainly stated in the law: THOU SHALT 
  NOT KILL (And do not allow anyone to manipulate or bend this commandment to 
  appear like I am saying: &quot;Thou shalt not murder,&quot; thereby rationalizing 
  their own fears, and their own lack of spiritual understanding, and justifying 
  their own violent ways). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Even as they refused to abide in His precepts, God has chased 
  His children across the pages of history. And each time they fell captive to 
  the ideologies of the nations round about them He has liberated them--by igniting 
  wars behind them and around them, waking their minds while confounding the thoughts 
  of their captors. It is happening at this very moment in time. Thus the words: 
  <i>Follow peace with all men </i>(at all times, and in every situation)<i>, 
  without which no man shall see the Lord.</i> (Hebrews 12:13-29). The Scriptures 
  also say: <i>And I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no 
  more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it to him, </i>(them). 
  (Ezekiel 21:27). So we look into the world and begin to have second thoughts 
  about what we see out there--about those who are overturning the world order 
  on God's behalf. Was it not already written of the Red Horse that went out riding 
  after the White Horse in 1917, that <i>Power was given unto him that sat thereon 
  to take peace from the earth...and there was given unto him a great Sword.</i> 
  (Revelation 6:4). So why do we feel compelled to resist it, or fight against 
  it, and that contrary to the Word of God? (Romans 13:1-4). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(These 
  words were written before the collapse of the Soviet Union, but they still hold 
  true)</font>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Death and bloodshed, strife and the sword, calamities 
    and famine, tribulation and the scourge, these things are created for the 
    wicked, and for their sake came the flood...</font></i><font size="+1">(Ecclesiasticus 
    40:9-11).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">But does it not also say: <i>And mine ARMS shall judge the 
  people </i>(not <i>Arm</i>, but <i>Arms</i>) ...(Isaiah 51:5). If the Strong 
  RIGHT Arm of the Lord extends from the center of the Oracle up into Russia, 
  the other Arm extends into the realm of Islam. Both of these are instruments 
  of Power in the Hands of God. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Theophany of Exodus, chapter 19, is a prophetic description 
  of those events that began to transpire in the world at the turn of the 20th 
  century. Matthew refers to those days leading up to the first World War as <i>The 
  Beginning of Sorrows.</i> (Matthew 24:8). And because Moses had the gift of 
  sight, and because he was a figure of the Good Shepherd, God enabling him to 
  see into the events that would come to pass in these times, he wrote: <i>God 
  said...Thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed 
  to yourselves, THAT YE GO NOT UP INTO THE MOUNT, or touch the border of it: 
  whosoever toucheth the Mount shall be put to death. </i>And neither can we who 
  live in America claim, as can the people who lived in these other lands, that 
  we were already in the Mount itself when it began to shake, because not only 
  has God published these laws in America for every eye to see, and for every 
  soul to consider, but He also set a great ocean between us and those events 
  themselves. (Revelation 7:13-17 is a paraphrase of Exodus 19:12-28, and speaks 
  of the pathway God made across the Sea for all those who came out of these great 
  tribulations to America in these last times)...</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;GERMANY DECLARES WAR ON RUSSIA, 
    FIRST SHOTS ARE FIRED: the headline stretched across the top of the New York 
    Times on August 2, 1914. Repeated in different forms in newspapers all across 
    the country, its alarming message turned what would have been a typical Sunday 
    into a gloomy day across the United States. The Times editorial attempted 
    to put the nation's shock and horror into words:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'With Germany's declaration of 
    war against Russia, the bloodiest war ever fought on earth and the least justified 
    of all wars since man emerged from barbarism has apparently begun...The threat 
    of war on this unprecedented scale, its very nearness, the overwhelming fear 
    that it may not be averted are proofs of the backwardness of Europe. By permitting 
    themselves to be brought so near to war they prove that their civilization 
    is half a sham. They have reverted to the condition of savage tribes...and 
    falling upon each other in a fury of blood and carnage to achieve the ambiguous 
    designs of chieftains clad in skins and drunk with mead.'</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At church that morning, countless 
    Americans prayed for peace and listened as ministers reminded them that the 
    steady progress of mankind, so blithely taken for granted only last Sunday, 
    had suffered a terrible setback. New York papers quoted the words of a local 
    Presbyterian minister who leaned over the pulpit and cried:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'It almost makes us feel...what 
      a poor miserable world this is, after all, in which to live. Here we are, 
      nearly 2,000 years after the birth of Christ when the message of good will 
      was preached to an erring world, and we are on the brink of what may prove 
      to be the most disastrous and awful conflict in the world's history. Oh 
      the misery of it at this time in our much vaunted civilization!'</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adults in congregations all over 
    the country glanced down at their children and reflected on their good luck 
    at being Americans. At that very moment, millions of German, Russian, English 
    and French boys were preparing to kill each other in a senseless war. The 
    sons of Europeans everywhere faced instant death. American boys, by contrast, 
    faced nothing more serious than the opening of school in the fall. They were 
    untouched by the prospect of violent death simply because they had been born 
    on the right side of the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic...had always kept the 
    United States free from Europe's troubles. As British troops marched off to 
    war, singing the popular 'Pack Up Your Troubles,' Americans still believed 
    that their boys would never experience the horrors of this or any other international 
    war, so long as the Atlantic didn't evaporate.&quot; </font>Hooray For Peace,

  War, and every other subsequent war in this century. (See Matthew 24:3-21...KJV; 
  understand Acts 13:40,41; and Habakkuk, chapter 1). For God in those days had 
  already begun to judge the City that is called by His Name, and the Austrian

<p><font size="+1">When the merchant-founders of the American nation established 
  their revolution, their rebellion (in strict defiance of those principles layed 
  down in 1 Peter, chapter 2), they were able to gain the people's allegiance 
  by employing such lofty concepts from Holy Writ, as <i>commonwealth</i>, <i>liberty</i> 
  and <i>justice</i>. And by doing so were able to confuse the mind of the people 
  who followed them headlong into those affairs. (Many, of course, did not fall 
  willingly but were surrounded by the national fervor and just got conscripted, 
  and still are). Even now the president calls himself and those who are enlisted 
  in his cause, &quot;Peacemakers.&quot; Nevermind that he does not mean it in 
  the last resort as Christ intended it to mean, as long as he can clothe himself 
  in the idea itself. And as long as the leaders of the nation can get the innocent, 
  the religious, and the simple-minded who cannot distinguish between truth and 
  its image, from discovering the difference, they will continue to rampage the 
  earth, imagining that their kingdom is secure (see Deut.29:14-29). For God, 
  the people reason, must surely favor in the balance a nation which numbers among 
  its own so many of His own. And God, the leaders reason, will not destroy us 
  as long as all of Their children are here among us. (Exodus 1:8-10). But what 
  does it say:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">If you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land 
    before you...then it shall come to pass that those ye let remain of them shall

    them...</font></i><font size="+1">(Numbers 33:51-56).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">(These are extremely serious words, and the reality of them 
  came to bear upon us on the morning of September 11th). If we are the seed of 
  Abraham according to the Scriptures (and by this we imply every single soul 
  on earth who claims the lineage of Abraham, or who walk in the precepts of Abraham), 
  then it is very important that we understand what all of this implies, especially 
  if we are to inherit the land in which Abraham and his seed have been strangers 
  all these centuries--the <i>Land</i> (and by this we mean <i>the State of Mind</i>) 
  promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. First of all we realize intuitively that 
  the children of the Spiritual Nation are not allowed to literally set boundaries 
  around any piece of real estate on this earth, or to actually claim any country 
  or piece of land as their own as the American nation did--for the true spiritual 
  People, and everyone who joins them, are heaven-bound and must remain strangers 
  and pilgrims in the earth throughout all of the days of their lives. The Promise 
  is still &quot;on the other side.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Nevertheless, we also realize that the early adepts in this 
  mystery entered Europe, not only in the time of Abraham, and again in the time 
  of Moses and Joshua, and then again in the Mystery of Christ almost 2,000 years 
  ago. These came up into the hidden center of the Oracle (into the only <i>land</i> 
  a child of Light is allowed to rule over--their own Body), bearing with them 
  all of the hidden meanings of the Sacred Scriptures...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> And therefore it is written: <i>But in the Fourth generation 
  they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. 
  </i>(Genesis 15:16). Who are the Amorites, and who are the Fourth generation? 
  The Amorites are the children of the West, and all of the children of Abraham 
  in our time are the Fourth generation. Thus in 1985 (or you may count it from 
  1606 and the founding of Jamestown) a year in which the American nation marked 
  the 400th year of its own national epic, or the 400th year since English colonists 
  first came ashore along the East coast of what is now called the United States 
  of America--the words began to be fulfilled which said:</font></p>

  <p><i><font size="+1">And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of Three years

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Despite the fact that these very judgments are unfolding before 
  our eyes, the reaction of certain American churchmen and &quot;scholars&quot; 
  will be to say that these words do not apply to our times, that these things 
  happened in the past, in the East, when the children of Israel were captive 
  in Egypt before the time of Aaron and Moses. We have been demonstrating, however, 
  how all things that were written in the past, and which happened then in the 
  most obscure ways (if they ever actually happened at all), are coming to pass 
  <a href="SideLinks/Nile.htm">here in the West</a>, in the most vivid and historic 
  ways, as it is written: <i>From the rising of the Sun unto the going down of 
  the same, </i>(Malachi 1:11), and <i>The days are at hand, and the effect of 
  every vision.</i> (Ezekiel 12:22-28). Just as we compared the Church's presence 
  in America to Israel's captivity in Babylon in the previous chapters, so we 
  have also compared it to Israel's captivity in Egypt because God has laid all 
  of these biblical episodes one on top of the other. (To understand this is to 
  understand how to read and interpret the Bible). Thus what did Pharaoh (the 
  spirit of the world-ruler) say to his advisors--those who were assisting him 
  in keeping the mind of Israel in captivity:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="+1"><i>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased 
    abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty; and the land was 
    filled with them.</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Now there arose a new king over Egypt, which knew not 
    Joseph </font></i><font size="3">(the Word of God)</font><font size="+1">.</font></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And he said unto his people, Behold, the children of Israel 
    are more and mightier than we.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Come on, Let us deal wisely </font></i><font size="3">(deceitfully)</font><font size="+1"><i> 
    with them; lest they multiply, AND IT COME TO PASS </i><font size="3">(in 
    the fulness of time, at the end of the age)</font> <i>THAT WHEN THERE FALLETH 
    OUT ANY WAR, they join also to our enemies and so get them out of the land...</i>(Exodus 
    1:7-10).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">When the leaders of America, and the American religious establishment 
  which supports them, entices young souls to enlist in their causes they still 
  resort to the most indiscriminate use of the Holy Scriptures, just as Pharaoh 
  and his ministers were able to until Aaron and Moses came down to them. (And 
  even then the people were angry at these two for telling them about the nature 
  of their captivity. The people were under the spell of nationalsim, and did 
  not want to hear it...Exodus 5:21; 6:9; Isaiah 52; John 8:34). Just recently 
  (when this letter was first written), in a speech to the National Religious 
  Broadcasters Conference, Ronald Reagan said that the Scriptures &quot;were on 
  their side,&quot; and went on to justify his arms buildup by saying...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Luke 14:31, in which Jesus 
    in talking to the disciples spoke about a king who might be contemplating 
    going to war against another king with his 10,000 men, but he sits down and 
    counsels how he is going to do against the other fellow's 20,000 and then 
    he says he may have to send a delegation to talk peace terms&quot;...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">And then, without any regard whatsoever to the fact that the 
  passage in Luke refers to the one in the Psalms which says: <i>The chariots 
  of God are 20,000, even thousands of angels: The Lord is among them, as in Sinai, 
  </i>(Psalm 68:17), he continued:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I don't think the Lord that 
    blessed this country as no other has ever been blessed intends for us to someday 
    negotiate because of our weakness.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">But this is exactly what God requires of them. Not that they 
  should have surrendered to the Communist system of things, but to God who is, 
  as the Scriptures say: <i>King of</i>(all) <i>kings, and Lord of </i>(all) <i>lords, 
  </i>(and the Mind of all minds). In other words, those in the Reagan-Bush camp 
  should have been counseled by their <i>christian</i> ministers to not only fear 
  the God of Heaven, and to disarm, (down to that last deadly sniper rifle that 
  is now killing people in the Washington D.C. area, in the same way as America 
  has financed the killing of men, women and children in hundreds of other places 
  throughout the globe), but to immediately confess the real spiritual weaknesses 
  and fears that have motivated them to such violence, and the great historic 
  state of arrogance and pride that they have come to, and own up to their responsibility 
  for the judgments that are now unfolding everywhere around them. While those 
  in the Clinton and Carter camps should have been made fully aware by their own 
  religious counselors--(Carter is his own religious counselor)--of their own 
  historic apostasy, and of their ultimate impotence in the face of this same 
  Divine Reality, for in their own vain attempts to bring peace to a world under 
  judgment, they too <i>Honour the god of forces, whom their fathers knew not. 
  </i>(Daniel 11:36-38).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">And while these great, earthly men search the Scriptures for 
  a quote here and there to justify themselves and their lofty dreams, they themselves 
  do not believe the Scriptures, and pay no attention to the broad spiritual context 
  in which their favorite verses are framed. Nor do they care about the actual 
  lives of the thousands of young men and women they are willing to sacrifice 
  on the battlefields of this world--and for what purpose? To upset, or to forestall 
  the very day that the Book they pretend to study, actually prophesies of and 
  requires. <i>The double-minded are unstable in all of their ways</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">If we did not already know the answer, if we were not already 
  versed in the history of the world, from the time of the first &quot;strong 
  man&quot; to our own time (It all began with Cain and Nimrod, after they silenced 
  Abel), we would wonder how these men ever came to imagine that it is their right 
  to order the lives and the economies of so many other human beings in the earth, 
  and worse, to order these peoples and their children to death whenever they 
  decide, or whenever it is in their interest to do so. Who do they imagine gave 
  them this right? The terrible answer, of course, is that God did--so that He 
  could demonstrate to the whole world, for all future times, how He will rise 
  up in the other powers of the earth to destroy anyone, or any nation, that takes 
  this prerogative to themselves again in the name of God. And we wonder why more 
  people haven't thought more seriously and deeply about it all. These men are 
  &quot;gangsters&quot; on a world scale. What makes it all seem so legal is the 
  fact that these criminals are the ones who are also making the laws. Their sins 
  against Nature, and against the precepts of Universal Righteousness, are so 
  pervasive and overwhelming that these things do not seem to be sins at all. 
  And now they seem to have come--at least in their own imaginations--to the threshold 
  of their own World Order. But because they will not be able to bring it to pass 
  we in turn must not offer ourselves in their attempts to perform it:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil in their 
    beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power 
    of their hand.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and 
    houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man 
    and his heritage.</font></i></p>
  <p><i><font size="+1">Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, against this family 
    do I devise an evil, from which they shall not remove their neck; neither

  <p>Michael, as you were being taught that your service would be in the cause 
    of furthering and protecting the basic rights and freedoms, and the well-being 
    and prosperity of the American people, what someone should have told you, 
    but didn't, was that you would be protecting--not the right of all Americans 
    to these things, but--their right to compete against each other for these 
    things. (And even not so much against each other, but against other peoples 
    and nations for these things). To compete against each other for resources, 
    however, or for well-being, or fame, or for anything, is to violate the most 
    sacred precepts of religious life. We are commanded to <i>love one another 
    as ourselves</i>, to <i>esteem each other better than ourselves, </i>and <i>to 
    look not after our own wealth, but the wealth of others. </i>(1 Cor.10:24; 
    1 John 3:17,18; 1 Peter 1:21-23; Luke 16:9-15; 22:25,26; Prov.16:11,12; Deut.23:24,25; 
    2 Kings 5:25-27). We must not gain these things as individuals, but all of 
    us must gain these things together as a single people. You would be sacrificing 
    your life (and they would be very pleased to have you do it), in the cause, 
    and in the defense of those who violate these sacred precepts; and seeing 
    we are not even allowed to do these things how have become convinced that 
    we should fight and die for the right to do them?<font size="+1"> </font></p>
  <p>Do you recall, Michael, when I tried to explain why I would not permit my 
    son to play high school football with you? I told you that it was just another 
    training exercise for military service, where young minds are prepared, not 
    merely to compete with each other in life but to take exultant pride in this 
    kind of winning, at each other's expense--but also to go at the coache's command 
    (or the general's) without flinching or asking questions. And soon you would 
    be ordered into the greater clash of nations without questioning, even though 
    God has been telling us for thousands of years that these things would come, 
    and that those who did, would die. Notice how the football field is divided 
    into two sides, which automatically divides the players into two camps, each 
    battling for territory. Each stealing (intercepting) what is the other's, 
    and each willing to commit as much violence as it takes to defend what they 
    believe is rightfully their's. It is just mental leap from there to the belief 
    that the world is divided in the same way, and the two teams (the SUPERPOWERS), 
    are the &quot;good Capitalists&quot; and the &quot;evil Communists,&quot; 
    despite the commandment which says: <i>An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter 
    into the congregation of the Lord...for ever.</i> (Deuteronomy 23:3,4). This 
    means that none of the ways of this age, no materialistic system of things, 
    whether it be communistic or capitalistic, is acceptable to God. The &quot;field&quot; 
    is the world, Michael, and God has trained a Third team. These are all the 
    people of the world who are neither of these, and who refuse to be drawn into 
    the business of human warfare. It is with mixed and conflicting emotions, 
    of course, that they also realize that the rise of these nation-systems against 
    one another also signals the day of their own deliverance. And despite the 
    profession of some evangelists who say that while they desire peace they are 
    not pacifists (which is a severe spiritual contradiction), none but a true 
    pacifist will be able to fight themselves free from the impending events of 
    our time.<font size="+1"> </font></p>
  <p>Why are these evangelists not pacifists? Because they have not separated 
    themselves from the &quot;ways&quot; of the world, or from the doctrines of 
    the World-church which has been in violation of the precepts of Christ since 
    its own foundation. Therefore they have not learned how to divide what must 
    be regarded literally in the Scriptures--the very obvious precepts concerning 
    justice and righteousness, and the transformation of the heart and soul--from 
    those things the Spirit hid for the elect in allegories and metaphors. They 
    are bound to the &quot;letter&quot; of the Law and its outer meanings, in 
    the same way as they are bound to the outward affairs of this age. They see 
    with their eyes, but not with their hearts. Their spiritual eyes are welded 
    shut. And as a result they cannot come to the sublime, inner interpretation 
    of things. They say that is is America's duty to bring peace to the world, 
    and to ensure it among the nations. They deceive themselves. It is to further 
    their own natural way of life. Never mind that they pay no heed to the words 
    of Isaiah in the 59th chapter, or those of Paul at 1 Thessalonians, chapter 
    5, they have absolutely no idea what it would actually take to bring peace 
    to the world--that is, to appease the Terrible Presence of God in the affairs 
    of humankind...</p>
  <p><i>I</i> <i>am come to send Fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be 
    already kindled?</i></p>
  <p><i>I have a baptism to be baptised with </i>(see Matthew 3:11 in light of 
    the oracles)<i>, and how am I straitened until it be accomplished...</i>(Luke 
    12:49,50).</p>
  <p>They would be required to surrender their power, their personal fame, their 
    privileges, and their fallen world-view, and then to yield peaceably to the 
    manifestation of the truly Anointed ones. (See Zechariah, chapter 4). When 
    Abraham was pressing the Angel of Presence to spare the wicked city, he implored: 
    <i>Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet this once: Peradventure 
    TEN righteous souls shall be found there? And the Lord said,I will not destroy 
    it for TEN's sake.</i> (Genesis 18:32). This means that these men can help 
    bring peace to the world, if they really wanted peace, by not lifting a hand 
    against those who are laboring at the Left Foot of the Mystery of Christ (Five 
    on one side, Five on the other), as this Remnant rises up in our time to restore 
    the meaning of the Gospel of Christ. It is written of them: <i>Mark the perfect 
    man, their end is peace.</i> (Psalm 37:37), and <i>Warning every man and teaching 
    every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Jesus Christ. 
    </i>(Colossians 1:28):</p>

  <p>If peace had come at any time in this century as a result of the activities 
    of these earthly men, would we not also assume that righteousness and justice 
    had come also, because these two are the attendants of peace? (Isaiah 59; 
    James 4). And if it were possible these leaders could then dispense with the 
    whole doctrine of Messiah, which is God's promise to the poor and the truly 
    peaceful. And these leaders would have been able to succeed in creating the 
    world in their own image--exactly as they are attempting to today...</p>
  <p>But God has revealed with each day's rising Sun a promise of a greater Day 
    wherein every form of Darkness (<i>spiritual wickedness in high places</i>), 
    will be chased out of the world. The promise was passed on to us nearly two 
    thousand years ago with that one who, when transformed from a literal frame 
    of mind to a spiritual, moved mountains, spoke to angels, ascended into the 
    heavens, and began the process of turning the Gentile world into the pathways 
    of the Living God. We arrive at Paul, and with him to the state of mind he 
    was in before his own transformation into the Mystery of Light. (Acts 9:1-9; 
    26:12-18). We are <i>Saul</i>, the secular spirit in Israel, caught somewhere 
    in that spiritual space between the Light and the Darkness. We are religious 
    but unspiritual. We are patriotic, but to a cause which we must quickly abandon 
    when we see the Light. Paul was such a spirit, and more. He was a soul in 
    whom the mystery of the Two kings, Saul and David, was to be revealed. Saul 
    (the unspiritual man), and David (the spiritual man), divided an age--one 
    thousand years before Christ--just as Paul, the founder of this age, was Saul 
    before he died to his old nature and the times changed hands again in the 
    Mystery of Christ. At that moment in time Saul, the great &quot;literalist,&quot; 
    became like both Moses and DaViD, a great &quot;allegorist.&quot;</p>
  <p>We then find him who was Christ to the gnostics, and chief among mystics, 
    abandoning the Pharisaic traditions and national ambitions of his co-religionists 
    who eventually fell under the Roman siege of Palestine and the destruction 
    of that city of Jerusalem in the East. Paul was chosen to fulfill the words 
    which said: <i>And to his son will I give one tribe, </i>(Benjamin)<i>, that 
    David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem</i>, <i>the 
    City which I have chosen to put my Name there. </i>(1 Kings 11:36). As the 
    Higher Realities revealed themselves to Paul he also discovered the mystery 
    of Jerusalem, and the true wherabouts of the City of David. He had been ignorantly 
    treading over its streets for years. He learned that this City was not founded 
    on a rock in that far away, and barren region of Palestine, but on a Rock 
    (a Mystery) hidden there in the North, along the secret pathway of the Sun 
    (in the center of the Skull of the Great Dragon, Leviathan). He learned that 
    while the Sun does indeed rise in the East--as the children of Israel did 
    when they came up out of Egypt according to the Scriptures--it does not continue 
    there. He discovered the hidden pathway of the Essenes, who seemed more like 
    Hindus and Buddhists, and wayward Druids to him, than Jews. Afterwards, after 
    his own illumination, he too found his way into this Fellowship. He came back 
    up, he informs us, not by initiation however, but by personal &quot;revelation.&quot; 
    (Galatians 2:2). He introduced into this fellowship the mystery of<i> Jesus 
    Christ and him crucified</i>. (But this is another chapter).<font size="+1"> 
    </font></p>
  <p><i>These things did not happen in a corner,</i> Paul's disciple wrote: (but 
    at the very center of the Oracle). (Acts 26:26). Paul (Elisha) learned that 
    while men are busy defending the city that they think is their's, God is ever 
    active defending as well as chastising the City that is His. (See Isaiah 28:16-19; 
    Ephesians 2:19-22; 1 Peter 2:6-8). Reading the same Scriptures as the other 
    rabbis of his time, he learns to say:</p>
  <p><i>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the 
    weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling 
    down of strong holds, casting down imaginations, and every high thing that 
    exalteth itself against the knowledge of God. And bringing into captivity 
    every thought to the obedience of </i>Hesus-Crishna...<i>(2 Corinthians 10:1-6).</i><font size="+1"><i> 
    </i></font></p>
  <p>Was he negating the old writings which were filled with the episodes of Israel's 
    many wars? No, he was confirming them through the exegetical reasonings of 
    the Oral Traditions. He is expounding on their exact meanings. Whenever the 
    children of Israel joined with or against the neighboring nations in the actual 
    commission of warfare we shall find them in Scripture &quot;losing&quot; the 
    battle. Whenever remnant Israel refused to kill and make war, trusting instead 
    in the words of the prophets warning them of God's Presence in all opposing 
    forces, we find them &quot;winning&quot; the battle. Were the scribes and 
    prophets of old recording the events of the 20th century (they were), they 
    would have the greater number of the children of Israel defeated in both World 
    Wars. Why? Did they literally lose them? No, they were defeated because they 
    literally participated in them, and because in the commission of these wars 
    they sacrificed their sons and daughters to be devoured by Molech and Ba'al. 
    True worship degenerates to Ba'al worship when the God of All Nations is reduced 
    to being the god of one nation such as America, or Britain. (God is not an 
    American, nor is God white, or Protestant, or Catholic, and most certainly 
    God is not a capitalist). God transcends it all, and is larger and more sublime 
    than even our thoughts of God. (Neither is God black, or Asian, or Russian). 
    God is the Sum of it all--the sum of all of us. And whatever the Sum is doing 
    God is doing. (Right now God is judging the &quot;hell&quot; out of the world).<font size="+1"> 
    </font></p>
  <p>America's sense of its own moral superiority grows from the fact that as 
    a nation it has been stealing from the oracles of God--which are presently 
    situated here in America, along with those who carried them here--as did the 
    ancient priests and prophets of Ba'al when the oracles were in their part 
    of the world. And children are given to Molech and Ba'al when parents unknowingly 
    train them up in the warring ways of these nations, giving no heed to the 
    words telling us that God is, indeed, A CONSUMING FIRE, (Deuteronomy 4:24; 
    Hebrews 12:29), and A GOD OF WAR:</p>
  <p><i>Ye shall kindle No Fire throughout your habitations upon the Sabbath day...</i>(Exodus 
    35:3).</p>
  <p align="center">__________</p>
  <p><i>For a Fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell

  <p>What is this &quot;strong drink?&quot; It is the Cup of Divine Wrath that 
    God has been pouring out to the nations throughout the whole period of the 
    time of Christ, but to the dregs here in the 20th century:</p>
  <p><i>Thus saith the Lord of hosts </i>(The Lord of all the peoples on earth)<i>, 
    the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise 
    no more, because of the Sword which I will send among you.</i></p>
  <p><i>And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink,

  <p><i>A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a 
    controversy with the nations, He will plead with all flesh; He will give them 
    that are wicked to the sword...</i>(Jeremiah 25:27-31).<font size="+1"> </font></p>

  <p><i>But of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto

  <p><i>For yourselves know perfectly that the Day of the Lord so cometh as a

  <p>This is the cup that the leaders of this age have been forced to drink, even 
    when they seem not to want to. And this because it is in their hearts to drink 
    from it anyway. (If they should reason within themselves that the only reason 
    they are drinking from it is because God has forced them to, and decry the 
    injustice of it all, let them put the cup down. It is a day of release, let 
    them immediately cease from their warring ways). And while they hypocritically 
    rail against the drug problem in the streets and cities of this country--<i>The 
    curse causeless shall not come...</i>Prov.26:2; Leviticus 26--they remain 
    oblivious to the fact that their own &quot;drug of choice,&quot; the drug 
    that they subscribe to, is more lethal, more available, and more damaging 
    to the well-being of the people than all others. The profusion of drugs that 
    are consumed among the people below (crime in low places) is directly analogous 
    and related to the use of those &quot;intoxicants, &quot; thus that state 
    of mind that emanates from above (from spiritual wickedness in high places). 
    Those above are driven by greed, drunk with power and inebriated with violence.

  <p>How else could God separate the children of Darkness from the children of 
    Light in the last day? By peace? Of course not, for even the children of Darkness 
    desire peace and are quite content to be at peace in a time of peace. But 
    the children of Light, Michael, read the Scriptures in the light of the Divine 
    Spirit that is in them, so that when the terrors of War descend upon their 
    generation they do not rush out to engage the Lord in battle as the children 
    of Darkness do, for these always commit war in a time of war. (See Romans 
    8:1-8).</p>
  <p>Michael, take into account all that you know or have heard of the person 
    of Christ, and consider: would Christ have allowed himself (themselves) to 
    be enlisted in the armed forces of his time? In the Roman cause against the 
    world? Or in the Jewish cause against Rome? Does the Mind of God fight against 
    itself? Neither may we. And neither must we <i>Render unto Caesar</i> in these 
    matters as we have been told we must. (Please see the subchapter entitled 
    &quot;Give Unto Caesar?&quot; in the Addendum to this work):</p>
  <p><i>And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</i></p>
  <p><i>He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar,

  <p>Paul, when alluding to the story of Sarah and Hagar, says: <i>Which things 
    are an allegory. </i>(Galatians 4:24). Sarah is the mother of all the children 
    of Light in our time--the truly free sons and daughters who are now coming 
    to the birth, as it is written:</p>
  <p><i>The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took, and hid

    with the son of the freewoman, so then, brethren, we are not children of the 
    bondwoman but of the free, </i>(Galatians 4:30,31; Genesis 21:20), it means: 
    &quot;Let those who interpret the Sacred Scriptures literally, without insight

    be cast out and separated from those who interpret them spiritually. For the

    true interpretation, true Justice (Love), and absolute Non-Violence. If not, 
    then the whole cycle--from the time of Cain and Nimrod--will begin again. 
    How shall this separation be accomplished? The children of Darkness, if they 
    persist in their warring ways, shall simply bring the judgments of God down

  <p>When a person says that he or she is a Christian, a Jew, or a Muslim, it 
    implies that they are living by, and walking in the precepts associated with 
    that path (as they have been given to understand them--and many, as the world 
    can see, have not been given to understand them). There are those outside 
    of these traditions who make no such claims, and as such the precepts do not 
    directly apply (as long as they are not in violation of them that is...Romans 
    2:9-16). And the Nation-church (the <i>ecclesia</i>, the <i>rabbinate</i>, 
    the <i>umar</i>) has no right, nor responsibility to <i>impos</i>e them. <i>Sharia</i> 
    is an affair of the heart...That is the Critereon, Leviticus 1:2,3. All of 
    these distinctions,of course, the difference between believers and non-believers, 
    and between the different religions, will disappear as the true meanings of 
    the Law are expounded, and when the wisdom of the Law, and the righteousness 
    that was missing in the lives of <i>believers</i> are restored. (This is not 
    the place to enter into a discourse on the jurisdiction and administration 
    of the Law under the coming reign of Christ in the earth, but think of the 
    principles of the Tao; think of the principles of Gravity; think of the principles 
    of Love; think of a court with NO prosecutors):</p>
  <p><i>There shall be one law and one manner shall be for you and the stranger 
    that sojourneth with you...</i></p>
  <p><i>One ordinance shall be for both, for you of the congregation, and also 
    for the stranger that sojourneth among you, an ordinance forever in your generations, 
    as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord...</i>(Numbers 15:15,16).</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">__________</p>

  <p><i>And I charged you at that time, saying, Hear the causes of your brethren, 
    and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger 
    that is with him.</i></p>
  <p><i>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small 
    as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of a man; for the 
    judgment is God's...</i>(Deuteronomy 1:16,17).</p>
  <p>Ronald Reagan himself once said: &quot;We cannot as citizens pick and choose 
    the laws we will or will not obey.&quot; He also said, after the attempt on 
    his life, that his remaining years belong to Christ. If this is so (and remember, 
    Michael, the President in office will be your Commander in Chief, just as 
    the Invisible Presence of God is the Commander of all His troops), why does 
    he not feel as much of an obligation toward the Scriptures as all the rest 
    of us? How is it that he and those who officiate his laws are not &quot;afraid 
    of the Power?&quot; (Re-read Romans 13:1-7 in the living context of our own 
    times). What this means, of course, Michael, is that just as the first and 
    second-century Christians would not yield to Caesar--for reasons even beyond 
    his claim to be the Son of God--it is not your duty to fear the dictates of 
    the American leaders, even as they claim to be themselves the Sons of God; 
    but rather it is their duty to fear the Power of God as it is risen up in 
    the Earth. <i>Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of 
    the Stars, how high they are. </i>(Job 22:12). Look into the East.</p>
  <p>Why is there no tribute and honour, or fear due the President? Because they 
    come in the name of Christ, and because they say that they are our brothers, 
    and because there is another set of precepts governing the relationship between 
    brothers:</p>
  <p><i>If thy brother, the son of thy mother </i>(the Church)<i>, or thy son, 
    or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine 
    own soul, entice thee secretly </i>(or openly)<i>, saying, let us go and serve 
    other gods, which thou hast not known, nor thy fathers;</i></p>
  <p><i>Namely the gods of the people that are round about you, nigh unto thee, 
    or far off from thee, FROM ONE END OF THE EARTH EVEN UNTO THE OTHER END OF 
    THE EARTH;</i></p>
  <p><i>THOU SHALT NOT CONSENT UNTO HIM, NOR HEARKEN UNTO HIM; neither shalt thine 
    eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:</i></p>
  <p><i>But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be the first upon him 
    to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.</i></p>
  <p><i>AND THOU SHALT STONE HIM WITH STONES, that he die; because he hath sought 
    to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land 
    of Egypt, from the house of bondage, </i>(the house of Ignorance).</p>
  <p><i>And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness 
    as this among you...</i>(Deuteronomy 13:6-11).</p>
  <p>So as a people who have arrived at this &quot;other end of the earth,&quot; 
    we find ourselves in a situation where one of our <i>brothers</i> (Cain to 
    be exact), has ascended to the most powerful position on the face of the Earth, 
    to the seat of Pharaoh, and is subtly, and now not so-subtly, enticing us 
    to serve the gods (the precepts and philosophies) of the American nation--modern 
    Egypt. Who, or what, are these gods? In ancient times the <i>gods</i> were 
    representations of the Forces of nature and the Ideas that governed human 
    consciousness. Hebrew thought was born in the ability to elevate the idea 
    of these many gods, subordinating them to the higher and more sublime idea 
    of One God. Hebrew thought was born in the cradle of Atlantean civilization, 
    nurtured in the Vedas, formulated and structured in the Torah, and is being 
    brought to fulfillment in the Mystery of Christ. When the American nation 
    was founded (clothing itself in the garments of this epic, unfolding Mystery), 
    it became an <i>image</i> of the True Holy Nation that was still forming in 
    the womb of this age--indeed, upon the shores of the American continent itself. 
    Its idea of Liberty, however, was merely an image of that divine precept that 
    releases the soul--not to do as it pleases in the affairs of men, or to seek 
    its own ends, but from these very things themselves. True Liberty is a characteristic 
    of the higher spiritual mind. And while it allows each soul to work out the 
    details of its own salvation, to descend into the darkness of its own domain, 
    it always requires that the soul seek the path of ascent again, and provides 
    the way to it. True freedom allows the soul to break the shackles that bind 
    it to the natural world. And it allows the soul to enter into the new and 
    binding covenant God is about to make (again) with Their children, and through 
    them with all the other peoples of the Earth. (John 8:36; Jeremiah 31:312-40).</p>
  <p>And the sense of Jubilation that attended America's independence from the 
    <i>tyrant</i>--and who else is the Tyrant of History but God Himself...Psalms 
    1, and 2--was but a mere image of events that shall yet unfold, when the people 
    shall observe a real Jubilee, and a real day of Release, when everyone who 
    has entered this covenant shall really be &quot;truly&quot; released from 
    bondage, imprisonment, and debt, indeed, from the American order of things 
    itself...(Leviticus 25:1-13). (Of course these things could only happen in 
    America, and that is what is so historically unique and blessed about <i>the 
    American Experience</i>).<font size="+1"> </font></p>
  <p>And then their gods are the great personalities of history who have most 
    embodied these imperfect ways, and who have, above all others, filled the 
    world with these ideas--with their own violent and crafty ways. When these 
    famous men die, and while their remains are vanishing in the earth as if they 
    had never lived at all, others are carving and engraving images of them, to 
    be set up in all the high places and by-ways of the land for younger souls 
    to wonder at and emulate: </p>
  <p><i>The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the works of men's hands. 
    They have mouths but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; they 
    have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.</i></p>
  <p><i>They that make them are like unto them; so is everyone that trusteth in 
    them...</i>(Psalm 135:15-18).</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p align="center">__________</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O 
    Hellas, (O America), why trusteth thou for leadership in mortal men? who can 
    not escape the end of death? Why dost thou offer vain gifts to the dead? and 
    do sacrifice to idols? Who put this error in your heart, to do these things 
    and forget the face of the Great God? Revere the name of the Father of All, 
    and forget it not.&quot; </font>The Sibylline<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p>So how shall we stone them Michael? With stones? Remember, the <i>letter</i> 
    killeth. (It will kill us). And because we are not allowed to kill other human 
    beings we must discover another meaning to the commandment, and another way 
    of carrying it out. Yes, we will stone them, with the Law itself (see Matthew 
    3:9), with the very precepts that Moses inscribed on stone for the instruction 
    of the lawless, until they are dead to their old ways, or until they are dead 
    to our loyalties and affections. What does it say:</p>
  <p><i>When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and 
    shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king 
    over me, like as all the nations round about me </i>(see 1 Samuel 8).</p>
  <p><i>Thou shalt in any wise set a king over thee, whom the Lord thy God shall 
    choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest 
    not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.</i></p>
  <p><i>BUT HE SHALL NOT MULTIPLY HORSES </i>(WEAPONS) <i>TO HIMSELF, NOR CAUSE 
    THE PEOPLE TO RETURN TO EGYPT, forasmuch</i> <i>as the Lord hath said unto 
    thee, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.</i></p>
  <p><i>Neither shall he multiply wives </i>(various other points of view)<i> 
    unto himself, that his heart not turn away: neither shall he greatly multiply 
    to himself silver and gold.</i></p>
  <p><i>And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, THAT 
    HE SHALL WRITE HIM A COPY OF THIS LAW IN A BOOK OUT OF THAT WHICH IS BEFORE 
    THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES.</i></p>
  <p><i>And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his 
    life: that he may fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of the Law 
    and these statutes, to do them.</i></p>
  <p><i>That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not 
    aside from the commandment, to the Right hand, or to the Left: to the end 
    that he may prolong his life in his kingdom, he, and his children in the midst 
    of Israel...</i>(Deuteronomy 17:14-20).</p>
  <p>This means that if these Presidents even thought they were qualified to be 
    the king of the Jews and Christians in their land (in effect the Messiahs), 
    they must, before all others, keep God's statutes. Not only must they keep 
    them but they must write a copy of them with their own hand, and read out 
    of it every day of their lives. And when they do they will discover that not 
    only are they not allowed to be involved in any arms race, but they are not 
    even allowed to command an arsenal, for this is what is meant by <i>multiplying 
    horses</i>. (See Isaiah 30 and 31). And that they are not allowed to cause 
    us <i>to return to Egypt</i>. This means that they are not allowed to cause 
    us to think about America as the children of Israel were made to think about 
    Egypt before Aaron and Moses came down to them. Nor are they permitted to 
    cause us to think the same about the issue of warfare as we did when we were 
    Gentiles and not yet citizens of the commonwealth of Israel:</p>
  <p><i>Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye have made your iniquity 
    to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all 
    your doings your sins do appear; because I say, that ye are come to remembrance, 
    ye shall be taken without hand.</i></p>
  <p><i>And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel </i>(all of them)<i>, whose 
    day is come, when iniquity shall have an end.</i></p>
  <p><i>Thus saith the Lord God: remove the diadem, and take off the crown: (this 
    is going to be different): exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.</i></p>
  <p><i>I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, until he come whose right it is;

<div align="left"><font size="+1">As we approach the dimensions of Islam and the 
  mystery of the Qur'an, as we shall in the following chapter, we do so with a 
  deep sense of God's creative purposes in the affairs of humankind. We do so 
  with a deep understanding of the structure of reality, and of the nature and 
  the disposition of the human psyche, and its evolution in time. <i>Deep answers 
  to deep </i>says the Word. Thus we do so with a deep understanding that God 
  is no respecter of persons, or of religions, and with the realization that though 
  God does indeed love (and Nature ultimately favors), those who are coming to 
  spiritual perfection, each in their own specified time, there is another level 
  at which God seems to be wholly indifferent to those who have not entered yet 
  into the pathways of Divine Love, and who--by reason of their collective disposition, 
  and natural passions--have been set aside as instruments of Divine Instruction 
  (agents of human awakening) instead. Islam is such a phenomenon. It is the reflection, 
  in brilliant LIGHT and in great DARKNESS, of all that preceded it. Like Judaism 
  and Christianity before it, Islam will come to perfection here in the West. 
  Like Jews and Christians before them, the practitioners of Islam have been appointed 
  to both: to redemption as individuals and families, but to correction and judgment 
  as a religion. The hidden, spiritual dimensions of the Holy Qur'an itself shall 
  provide the judgment. The Mystery of Iniquity (built right into the structure 
  of Holy Writ), is no less applicable to Islam as it is to Judaism and Christianity. 
  Those who have overcome the literal and earthly dimensions of Islam, and have 
  found the deeper meaning of the Qur'an, shall be delivered. Those who continue 
  in their literal, and &quot;natural&quot; ways, regardless of their religious 
  zeal or affiliations, shall be corrected. Or--refusing in the end to yield to
