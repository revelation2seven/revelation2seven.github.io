  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;JE HOVAH...is a mispronunciation 
    of the Hebrew name, resulting from combining the consonants of that name, 
    YHVH, with the vowels of the word Adonay , 'lord,' </font>(Y-<b>A</b>-H-<b>O</b>-V-<b>A</b>-H)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
    which the Jews substituted for the proper name in reading the scriptures. 
    In such cases of substitution the vowels of the word which is to be read are 
    written in the Hebrew text with the consonants of the word which is not to 
    be read. The consonants of the word to be substituted are ordinarily written 
    in the margin; but inasmuch as Adonay was regularly read instead of the ineffable 
    YHVH, it was deemed unnecessary to note the fact at every occurrence. When 
    Christian scholars began to study the Old Testament in Hebrew, if they were 
    ignorant of this general rule or regarded the substitution as a piece of Jewish 
    superstition, reading what actually stood in the text, they would inevitably 
    pronounce the name Jehovah...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several centuries before the Christian 
    era the name YHVH had ceased to be commonly used by the Jews. Some of the 
    later writers of the Old Testament employ the appelative Elohim, God, prevailingly 
    or exclusively. A collection of Psalms (Ps. 42 to 83), was revised by an editor 
    who changed the YHVH of the authors into Elohim...observe also the frequency 
    of the 'Most High,' 'the God of Heaven,' &quot;King of heaven,' in Daniel. 
    The oldest Greek versions (Septuagint), from the third century B.C., consistently 
    use 'Kirios' (Lord), where the Hebrew has YHVH, corresponding to the substitution 
    of Adonay for YHVH in reading the original...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Josephus, who as a priest knew 
    the pronunciation of the name, declares that religion forbids him to divulge 
    it. </font>(It will also be seen that Josephus was an initiate into the Christian 
    mysteries)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">; Philo calls it ineffable, 
    and says that it is lawful for those only WHOSE EARS AND TONGUES are purified 
    by Wisdom to hear and utter it in a holy place (that is, for priests in the 
    temple); and in another passage, commenting on Leviticus 24:15,16, 'If any 
    one, I do not say should blaspheme against the Lord of men and gods, but should 
    even dare to utter his name unseasonably, let him expect the penalty of death.'...</font></p>

    it is said: 'He hath made everything BEAUTIFUL in its time; He also hath set 
    the Word in their heart;' yet so that man cannot find out the work that God 
    hath done from the beginning even to the end, the Divine Name was engraved 
    of the Foundation Stone, and the Lord guarded it in great secresy, so as not 
    to arrouse the evil inclinations in the hearts of men, who would desire to 
    know with its help all that shall come to pass in the end of time, until eternity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When king David had dug the Foundation

    Name on it. He put the Stone in the Holy of holies in the Temple. The sages 
    of Israel began to fear lest some young men might learn the Divine Name and 
    destroy the world. To prevent this they made two brazen lions which they placed 
    on Iron pillars by the Door of the Holy of holies, one on the Right and the 
    other on the Left. If anyone entered and learned the Divine Name these lions 
    would roar at him when he came out</font><b> </b>(see Jeremiah 25:29,30)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">,

    to Jerusalem, where he learned the Holy Letters of the Divine Name. He wrote 
    them on parchment, and uttering the Name to prevent pain, he cut his flesh 
    and hid the parchment therein. Then, again, pronouncing the Name, he caused 
    the flesh to grow together. As he left the door the lions roared, and the 
    Name was erased from his mind. When he was outside the City he cut his flesh, 
    and drew out the parchment, and when he studied its letters again he learned 
    the Holy Name.&quot; </font>The Legends of Jerusalem<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

    I'SRaEL (last word of the Torah), written in full circle, all the letters 
    near to each other (made of black fire against white fire)...The soul of Moses 
    contemplated them, here and there, trying to locate the beginning of the circle, 
    its end or its middle, but he found nothing, for there does not exist a precise 
    place where one enters the Torah, for it constitutes one whole, and while

    be illustrated in the form of calligraphy. The recitations also provoke visions 
    of motions and forms that take definite meanings and organize themselves in 
    surprising and disconcerting ways. THE NAMES BECOME A CHAOTIC SCRIPT, WITH 
    CHAINS OF STRANGE INTERLACED SHAPES, IN LINES THAT BECOME KNOTTED AND SHAPED

<p><font size="+1">There are many volumes of written works, from even before the 
  period of the Renaissance and Reformation, to our own time, dedicated to the 
  subject of the Divine Name and its various interpretations, and to its many 
  <i>magical</i> applications. In them the letters of the Tetragrammaton (Yod-Heh-Vaw-Heh) 
  have been affixed to astrological symbols, and in other ways to the primary 
  geometrical shapes of the created order. Most of these works have not been generally 
  available to those with less than an avid interest in the subject. Many have 
  been the works of Jews writing in Hebrew (and other mostly European languages). 
  Many other volumes have been the work of Christian kabbalists, and those who, 
  over the centuries, were drawn to the practice of perhaps the most secretive 
  of all kabbalistic arts--alchemy. These arts were of the most esoteric and darkly 
  compelling nature, for in the earliest pursuit of them--in the search for the 
  Philosopher's Stone which it was believed contained the power, the magic elixir, 
  or the necessary ingredient for transforming base metals into gold; possibilities 
  hinted at Job 28:1-3--the very discoveries in chemistry and physics that resulted 
  have brought humanity right into the midst of the Thermo-nuclear age, and to 
  the fullest meaning of the words: <i>For I have a (Fire) to be baptised with, 
  and Oh how I AM STRAITENED until it be accomplished.</i> Luke 12:49,50; Matthew

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the alchemist it must never 
    be forgotten that power over matter and energy is only a secondary reality. 
    The real aim of the alchemist's activities...is the transformation of the 
    alchemist himself, his accession to a higher state of consciousness. The material 
    results are only a pledge of the final result, which is spiritual. Everything 
    is oriented toward the transmutation of man himself, toward his deification, 
    HIS FUSION WITH THE DIVINE ENERGY, THE FIXED CENTER FROM WHICH ALL MATERIAL 
    ENERGIES EMANATE. The alchemist's is that science &quot;with a conscience&quot; 
    of which Rabelais speaks. It is a science which tends to exalt man rather 
    than matter; as Teilhard de Chardin puts it: &quot;The real aim of physics 
    should be to integrate Man as a totality in a coherent representation of the 
    world.&quot;</font></p>

    which transcends our inner visual sense. Since we are incapable of holding 
    a four-dimensional (or higher) image in the mind we must seek an intuitive 
    perception of the mentally examined symbol, a wordless and pictureless apprehension 
    of its fundamental identity. Only in this manner can the true Ineffable Name

  entitled, <i>TETRAGRAMMATON, The Secret to Evoking Angelic Powers and the Key 
  to the Apocalypse, </i>by Donald Tyson.<i> </i>The Kabbalah (as everyone who 
  is reading this chapter already knows) has become a very popular topic in our 
  time, and very necessarily so, and as such there are many works as this coming 
  into circulation. Many of them are simply exploitations of the subject and only 
  lead the reader into the (purely humanistic) maze of<i> SELF potentiality </i>(the 
  vertical dimension is missing), In such we discover the next wave of venture-capitalists, 
  of the &quot;new-age&quot; variety, playing with numerical and astrological 
  ideas, with healing and developmental techniques, and with a system of Gnosis, 
  for which they are hardly willing to pay the price. They are trafficking in 
  the Temple. However, many of these works are well studied (as this particular 
  work is), even for reasons the authors themselves cannot yet imagine. I will 
  leave you to them. In these particular illustrations we are able to follow a 
  simple path leading from the conceptual realm, into the material realm, and 
  then back into the conceptual realm again. That is, by following such a geometric 
  pattern out of Mind of Creation--from where all geometrical patterns and mathematical 
  formulas originate--from a realm of no dimensions to one, and then to the immediate 
  formation of a second and then a third, the mind can then make the necessary 
  leap forward into the abstract, conceptual world again--into the invisible, 
  fourth-dimensional domain of the Space-Time continuum, which overshadows and 
  governs from above all that is unfolding in the world below.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">We have chosen to present our sense of the subject in the form 
  of a letter that was sent to a Messianic group several years ago, who were in 
  turn (and still are I am sure) zealously dedicated to their own understanding 
  of the Holy Name:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To the brothers and sisters in the Holy Name,</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I just happened onto a copy of your magazine, <i>The Master 
  Key, Unlocking Bible Truth</i>. It was the September-October, 1988, edition 
  which included an article entitled &quot;Eliyahs Wanted.&quot; I am quite interested 
  in the subject, as it should be obvious to every student of the scriptures that 
  the spirit of Elijah must appear (again) from somewhere before the coming of 
  King Messiah. Just as Aaron went before Moses, and John the Baptist before the 
  Christ in his time, so the priestly spirit of Elijah must appear again with 
  the coming of Christ, and before the manifestation of the Lord's anointed ones 
  in our time, as it is written: <i>He hath made us kings and priests unto God 
  and his Father.</i> (Revelation 1:6), and as it is also written:</font></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Once when speaking on this subject on the street corners of 
  Brooklyn, New York, an orthodox Jewish man said to me...well first he said to 
  me: &quot;Why do you people keep trying to convert us to this Jesus, when Christianity 
  itself refuses to be converted to its own teachings?&quot; His point was well 
  taken. And then he told me, somewhat jokingly, &quot;When Elijah the prophet 
  appears they will put a net over his head and carry him away.&quot; He may not 
  have been very far from the truth, but I suspect the consequences of such a 
  work will be far more severe. Here he (or they) comes, overturning our most 
  cherished beliefs and opinions, and driving out of us the devils of spiritual 
  pride and religious arrogance. (<i>Who can stand when he appeareth?</i>...Malachi 
  3:2). And among them the dark spirit of spiritual ignorance itself. Will we 
  put up with such a person, or persons? I should say not. At our best we shall 
  ignore or dismiss them, but if they should prove &quot;seditious&quot; enough 
  we will go ahead and arrest them, and if the times are critical enough (which 
  they will be) we will go ahead and kill them, or consent to it by not speaking 
  up when it happens. But this remnant belongs to the First Resurrection, this 
  second death, or the death of the physical body, cannot harm them. You spoke 
  partly of their situation in your article:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Jews in the days of Yashua 
    the messiah, were looking for a personal Eliyah, and they did not recognize 
    the Eliyah who fulfilled prophecy. Today we are confronted with the same condition...&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">Their situation is aggravated up to now, however, by the many 
  individuals and groups who claim to represent this spirit in our time. The list, 
  and the many various doctrines they espouse, is long, and it would not serve 
  us to try to name them all here. But each claim in some way to be the Remnant 
  in our time, to have opened up the Seven Seals, and some of them even claim 
  to know how to pronounce the Holy Name itself. And each invariably imply that 
  we must be converted to their doctrines before we can be &quot;saved,&quot; 
  or before we can receive enlightenment. (Like one church that told me unless 
  I was baptised in accordance with their formula my family and I were doomed. 
  Or another well-meaning brother who told me to get baptised again, even after 
  I was baptised again, but this time in the name of &quot;Jesus only&quot;). 
  We must admit it is all quite confusing. It is no wonder that many critically 
  minded people choose to leave the mystery alone...and as well they should, for 
  it has been sealed. Your article, I think, goes on to suggest the same...</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The teachers and preachers 
    of the present day are teaching the return of a personal Elijah </font>(they 
    are?...well some are)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, and the people

    the Tishbite, and like the people of the Savior's day, they will not recognize 
    the person, or persons, sent in the spirit and power and service of Eliyah. 
    They will reject and refuse to listen to them, even doing them violence, so 
    that it behooves us to examine the evidence and identification marks, so that 
    we might be able to identify those sent to fulfill the Eliyah work, that is, 
    to warn the people of impending judgment and to restore righteousness through 
    the everlasting gospel.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thus I was happy to read your following words: &quot;This study

  Eliyah movement.&quot; And I knew you would be happy to consider this work entitled 
  <i>An History and a Commentary on the Tree of Life. </i>I believe it can lend 
  something to your already exhaustive research on the subject. You will agree, 
  I am sure, that the Elijah movement will be first of all one of reconciliation. 
  Where it says <i>He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and 
  the heart of the children to the fathers, </i>it must mean that they will know 
  how to gather (not cast out), all things past and present, Jew, Christian, and 
  all others alike, </font><font size="+1">back into the universal dimensions 
  of the Christ mystery...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> (And I hope you are not like those who immediately and proudly 
  contend that there &quot;is no mystery,&quot; and that &quot;we need no one 
  to instruct us...for all things have already been revealed to us by the Spirit.&quot; 
  Such high ideas are intended only for those who are not proud or dogmatic about 
  them, and who have already entered into the center of the Christ-mystery itself, 
  by way of the Spirit's instructions. Such words were not intended for those 
  who have refused to be instructed, and who are still standing outside of the 
  Mystery of the Fellowship of Light...And there are many individuals and groups 
  standing without, who believe they are situated right in the middle. They believe 
  they are looking out, as it were, from their own exclusive position onto a world 
  fallen everywhere around them, and that somehow the world will beat a path to 
  their gate, or at least to their doctrines, in the day of the Lord. And that 
  those who don't will be lost. These fail to consider that the true Remnant in 
  our time is a number of souls far greater than themselves--a symbolic number 
  of 7,000 to be exact--and that this Remnant will be comprised of individuals 
  who are presently sojourning among all other groups, or no particular group 
  at all. Thus they do not seriously consider the full impact of the words which 
  say: <i>The first shall be last, and the last shall be first, and there shall 
  be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth</i>). </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Remnant in our time will be able to reconcile the teachings 
  of all the ancients to our present beliefs, and most of all to our very urgent 
  needs. Their's will be a ministry of restoration. They will break down the doctrinal 
  walls of partition that have divided the religious world from itself, and show--in 
  a spirit of love and deep reverence for every religious tradition--how the Mystery 
  of Christ does, indeed, fill all and is all. This means that their view of Christ 
  will be different and far more expansive than the common view which presently 
  keeps us all apart from each other. This Remnant will instruct us in the ways 
  of the ancient mystics, and in the teachings of that group of Essenes who, as 
  Peter said, <i>spoke as the oracles of God</i>. (1 Peter 4:11). We have learned 
  by studying these traditions that the oracles Peter speaks of are all branches 
  from the primary Oracle, the World Tree, the Tree of Life. By studying the oracles 
  we can literally discover the hidden meanings that have been embedded or encoded 
  in every ancient and sacred text, as well as in every ritual and ceremony, and 
  thus the nature of God's Universal Presence in the affairs of the entire world:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">In light of such things I am sure you will be interested in 
  seeing how the Holy Name reveals its meanings again upon the dimensions of the 
  Oracle. We have traced the growth of this Tree from ancient America (where its 
  historic roots are embedded here in the Western ends of the earth), across the 
  dark Atlantic to Britain, and then across Europe to the East--to India and Egypt, 
  and beyond--to the time of Moses. By that time in history all of the universal 
  ideas embodied and ensouled in the Oracle--those things that first began to 
  reveal themselves in Adam, and which were by then governing the religious and 
  political activities of almost the entire ancient world--were finding their 
  particular fulfillment in the rise of that people who would come in time to 
  call themselves by the name of Israel, and who would trace their lineage to 
  that mythico-scientific-and philosophical movement that grew out of the teachings 
  of the Law and the Prophets of Israel. And then we followed the path of this 
  esoteric movement back to America, back to Eden again, in the great Solar/Lunar 
  Mystery of Christ (and into the collective thought-patterns of all the people 
  of Faith who have come back this way in our times). In so doing we have learned 
  how long before the Great Angel of Divine Presence appeared to the world in 
  the time of Christ (upon the limbs of the Cosmic Tree, in the Two-handed form 
  of the Universal Non-violent Yajna-Sacrifice--the Suffering Servant of Israel), 
  it appeared to Moses and Aaron and the elders of Israel in his other more terrible 
  form as the very God of War Himself (a figure the rabbis associate with the 
  person of the Metatron...Exodus 23:20-23; 24:9,10). Which is why the Angel commanded 
  them at that time to walk in every way that God would reveal to them--which 
  meant in the absolutely nonviolent ways of Christ, especially now as we approach 
  the Great Day of the Lord itself. Israel's journey into the wilderness, then, 
  became in types and images a figure of the Nation-church's eventual journey 
  in the Mystery of Christ, which would carry it at last to this end of the earth 
  and this fulness of time. (See 1 Corinthians 10:1-12):</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It is for these reasons the Essenes would not participate in 
  the sacrificial rituals at that temple made-with-human-hands in Palestine, for 
  these sacrifices were being offered continuously in violation of the higher 
  precepts of the Torah. (Nor would the children of Light in those times participate 
  in the rituals of human combat). For all the precepts in Leviticus looked forward 
  in the Oracle to their fulfillment in the Mystery of Christ, in the ordinances 
  of the great Passover, which were to be observed from the time of John the Baptist 
  to our own time, when the true priests of Israel (male and female alike), would 
  bring themselves as a burnt offering to the Lord; when this ever-present Remnant 
  in the earth would be willing to lay down their own lives in the cause of God--in 
  the cause of true justice, and of true love, and of true Peace--all of which 
  have been the ultimate causes of God since the beginning:</font></p>

  to fill up the thinking of Western civilization itself? What can it mean where 
  it says: <i>There is no other name under heaven whereby men can be saved? </i>Surely 
  we are not saved just by pronouncing a word, for even the children of Darkness 
  can pronounce words. But when we discover the elements of the Name, and their 
  numerical and hieroglyphic connections to the Oracle, the Tree of Life, we discover 
  why the Name could not be spoken aloud in times past--because it was being concealed, 
  and to give any other meaning to it before the proper time would render it of 
  no effect. People would say the word, but nothing would happen, the world would 
  stay the same. When we understand it in light of these present times, however, 
  and in conjunction with the manifestation of the Messiahs on the limbs of the 
  Oracle, we are saved.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">God took Moses up into the Mountain of Revelation and showed 
  <i>him</i>, not only the past, when Adam fell from (their) place on the Tree 
  of Life, but far off into the future, to the time of restoration. God showed 
  Moses how the Word would appear to the world in its own Universal Androgynous 
  form at the time of Love and Power--the time of John the Baptist and Paul. And 
  then God showed him the last days when the Mystery would appear to the world 
  again at the time of Endurance (or Victory) and Majesty. God showed Moses how 
  the events of his time were only a foreshadow of those that would occur again 
  in the last days, at the other end of the earth, as it is also written: <i>And 
  Moses was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those 
  things which were to be spoken after. </i>(Hebrews 3:5). </font></p>

  Aleph and Lamed, whose numerical equivalents are One and Thirty in the Hebrew 
  Alphabet. We will begin to visualize these letters, as well as the letters of 
  the Tetragrammaton, in their older Proto-Hebrew-Phoenician form in order to 
  add (or recover) the proper historic dimension to their meanings...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">That these letters in the left-hand column are the original

    AND THE TABLES OF STONE.&quot; </font>The Talmud<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The square block, Chaldean characters with which most everyone 
  is familiar in our time, were not in use at the time of the first sabbath. They 
  did not exist when the Torah was first composed. Thus the complilers of <i>Mishna-Torah 
  </i> must be referring to the original Proto-Hebrew-Phoenician letters (perhaps 
  even without intending to). The square block letters are a later creation (as 
  is the modern &quot;spoken&quot; Hebrew language itself), and were employed 
  by certain scribes in Babylon, in their own very early attempt to erect a fence 
  around the Torah, to conceal its further meanings from the Gentile world, into 
  whose hands it had everywhere &quot;fallen.&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">But now Moses was being indoctrinated by the Spirit into a 
  more specific understanding of the Oracle, between its static dimensions if 
  you will, and its historic and prophetic dimensions (beyond the general meanings 
  of the word <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EL</font>, and into the 
  meaning of the Name <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">YHVH </font>). 
  He could see the dimensions of the Tree of Life spanning the times from East 
  to West, from Kether to Malkhuth, and he could see in the vast historical space 
  between the two, not only the first gleamings of this new Name, but the general 
  outline of the future itself. Which is why from ancient times until now those 
  in the East read the holy letters, <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HVHY</font>, 
  from East to West--in the same direction as this great epic of redemption...</font></p>

  but from the Heavens above to the Earth below, as it is written: <i>Which is 
  the Body, the Fulness of Him that filleth all in all. </i>(Ephesians 1:23).

<p><font size="+1">Now Moses was made to understand that these great things could 
  not come to pass if the Spirit of Elohim (the Spirit of the Divine Mother conjoined 
  with the Father), would not descend to the people, and then with them to the 
  ends of the earth. Thus he saw the words, <i>Ruach Elohim</i>, the Spirit of 
  Elohim, descending to take up its place in the midst of the Holy Name. The numerical 
  value of these two words (RUaCh ALoHIM) is 300 (For <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R</font>

  which now stood for both words, taking its place among the letters Yod Heh Vaw 
  Heh, creating the word <font size="+2">YHShWH</font>, the vert letters that 
  will serve to make up the name (J)ehoshua. Now the Name could be pronounced...yet 
  not simply pronounced so much as understood, internally, especially as we see

    'Yeheshuah,' was held by the Christian kabbalists of the Renaissance to have 
    deprived Tetragrammaton of all its power, even as Jesus Christ had supplanted 
    the jealous God of the Hebrews </font>(which he hadn't; witness the events 
    of the 20th century)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> and the Gospels 
    had displaced the Old Testament </font>(which they havn't...&quot;I set before 
    thee <i>death </i>and <i>Life&quot;</i>)<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This view was first explicitly 
    set forth by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-94) in his seminal seventy-two 
    <i>Conclusions</i> on the kabbalah, published in 1486. In the fourteenth conclusion, 
    he argued that the insertion of the &quot;shin&quot; into Tetragrammaton represents 
    the descent of the fiery holy Spirit into the fourfold realm of matter--the 
    incarnation of God in human flesh. Pico held that the addition of the Shin 
    made the previously ineffable IHWH pronounceable.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This premise was defended by the 
    first great non-Jewish kabbalist Johannes Reuchlin (1455-1522) in his highly 
    influential work <i>De Verbo Merifico </i>(On the Wonder Working Word)...and 
    his later work <i>De Arte Cabalistica </i>(On the Science of the Kabbalah)...Reuchlin 
    held that with the birth of Jesus, the name of the Four letters had been rendered 
    powerless, its abilities to cause miracles having passed into the name Jesus. 
    This is why in the Gospels the name of Jesus has such force in casting out 
    demons...and healing the sick. By using the holy tongue, Hebrew, and the numerical 
    methods of the kabbalah, Reuchlin maintained that the truthes of Christian 
    doctrine could be proved and, more than this, that all occult secrets could 
    be laid bare...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hence Christ saith, 'whatsoever 
    you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you;' and after his resurrection 
    saith, 'In my name they shall cast out devils'...so that the name of Four 
    letters is no longer necessary, the whole virtue thereof being translated 
    into the name Jesus...Neither is there any other (as Peter saith) under heaven 
    given unto men, by which they may be saved.&quot; </font>Tetragrammaton, pp. 
    47-49<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It was Moses' task, then, to both reveal and conceal these 
  things until the times were full. So he called one Oshea (spelled <font size="+2">HWShA</font>...Heh 
  Vaw Shin Ayin), whose name grew out of the root word <font size="+2">Y'ShA</font> 
  (Yod Shin Ayin). (Please see its form in the paleo-Hebrew script). We notice 
  that the last letter in the old-Hebrew form of this word, Ayin, also forms a 
  Circle, one that would be complete when the the Nation-Church finally completed 
  its journey back across the sea to Eden, to the land we now call America. The 
  word Y'ShA means, &quot;to be open, wide, or free, to be safe, to be avenged, 
  helped, and delivered, to be preserved, and saved&quot;--all the things we either 
  are, or imagine ourselves to be in Christ.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">And Moses called Oshea </font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(or

</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">A Yod was added to the name, and another Vaw. Now we see what 
  the Spirit has done with the Name. The name Oshea <font size="+2">(or HWShA)</font> 
  already contained an Heh, or a number Five, indicative of the Power invested 
  in this captain of the &quot;armies&quot; of Israel, but the name Jehoshua (Yod 
  Heh Vaw Shin Vaw Ayin), or <font size="+2">(YHWShWA)</font>, containing two 
  Vaws, was sufficient to carry the mind of the Nation-Church across two periods 
  of time to the ends of the earth, and to the day wherein the Spirit would reveal 
  not only the significance of the second <font size="+2">H</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
  </font>but the meaning of all the other letters in the Holy Name...</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Containing two Vaws, or two letters equal to the number Six, 
  the name Jehoshua, or YH<font size="+2">W</font>Sh<font size="+2">W</font>A, 
  reveals how the children of Israel were directed to go Twice up into the Holy 
  Mountain, and to the city named Beauty: once in Old Testament times under Jehoshua, 
  and again in the time of Christ, as it is also written: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that 
    her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: </font></i><font size="+1"><i>FOR 
    SHE HAS RECEIVED OF THE LORD'S HANDS </i> <i>DOUBLE FOR ALL HER SINS</i></font><i><font size="+1">...</font></i><font size="+1">(Isaiah 
    40:2)</font><i><font size="+1">.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">The first ascent prefigured the second. Thus we open the Book 
  of Joshua in Old Testament times (please do so in the KJV of the scriptures), 
  but to fully understand it in the the light of history we must open it again 
  from the time of Christ to the present, as it is also written: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i><font size="+1">The Mighty God hath spoken and called the earth from the 
    Rising of the Sun unto the going down thereof,</font></i><font size="+1"></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"><i>Out of Zion the Perfection of Beauty God hath shined</i></font><i><font size="+1">...</font></i><font size="+1">(Psalm 
    50:1,2).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="+1">This second ascent into the Mystery did not only carry the 
  Nation-Church up into the regions of the Holy City (to a gathering not a dispersion), 
  but passed it to the great Falling Away here in the West. It has brought the 
  Nation-Church to all of the great terrible events, as well as to the great revelations 
  of the Twentieth century...</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Thus it was no mere coincidence that one of the pioneers of 
  quantum physics, Max Planck, assigned the letter &quot;h&quot; to his equation 
  defining the essential particle, or measurement of Energy--out of which all 
  other elements of nature are formed. (Nor is it just coincidence that there 
  have been recent speculations concerning the possibility that there are Five

  this Fifth force--which the Oracle seems to require, and which has the effect 
  of guarding the Door as it were, between these dimensions of reality and the 
  next, or between our world and the world beyond, allowing particles of Mind/Light

    clues to the fundamental nature and eventual fate of the cosmos.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A detailed analysis of Light from

<p><font size="+1">We might also note that the word ADONAY (Lord), which was substituted 
  for the Ineffable Name in the ancient Hebrew texts, also has its significance 
  on the Tree of Life. But first, we must see that just as the Hebrew mysteries 
  were sown into human consciousness along the 22 pathways of the Tree of Life, 
  employing the 22 letters of the ancient Hebrew alphabet, the form of the letters 
  themselves were transmuted in time into Greek and Latin (and therefore the Gospels), 
  and afterwards into English. The Divine Name was committed to the Oracles in 
  Hebrew, but it can only be interpreted in our time through the 26 letters of 
  the English alphabet. (English, of course, did not even exist as a language 
  in the time of Christ, but it was created by the Spirit in these last times 
  for just such a purpose). The Name Y + H + V + H = 26, just as the Four sefirot 
  on the Central Pillar of the Tree of Life also equal 26. (1 + 6 + 9 + 10 = 26).</font></p>

    Similarly <i>Bohu</i> was sifted and purified, and there issued from it 'an 
    earthquake,' as with Elijah. Then what we call 'Darkness' was sifted, and 
    there was contained in it Fire, just as to Elijah there appeared fire after 
    the earthquake. When what we call 'spirit' was sifted, there was contained
